Putting these tweets in the context of the author's intentions:
The author appears to be positioning themselves as a knowledgeable participant in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space. By sharing a presentation about a project they've invested in (ICN Protocol) and also sharing industry reports from reputable firms like Deloitte, they're showing both their specific project interests and their broader understanding of the blockchain ecosystem. This could be part of a strategy to build credibility and authority in the blockchain space, potentially to promote their own investments or to establish thought leadership.
