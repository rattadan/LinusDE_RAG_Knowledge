Contextualizing these tweets within the author's intentions:
The account "BoredLilGhost" appears to be a social media bot or coordinated promotional account specifically designed to amplify messages about cryptocurrency projects, particularly within the Cosmos ecosystem and blockchain gaming projects like Splinterlands and CryptoDungeon. The tweets are consistent with a strategy to create the appearance of grassroots support and enthusiasm for these projects. By retweeting and adding slight commentary, the account attempts to contribute to a social proof effect that could potentially attract new investors/users.

Now I'll summarize this information concisely for all tweets collectively as requested.
