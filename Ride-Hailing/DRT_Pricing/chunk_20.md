MATSim overview. The proposed optimization approach uses the agent-based and dynamic transport simulation
framework MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation, see www.matsim.org) [6]. In MATSim, each transport user
is modeled as an individual agent.

**2.1. Agent-based transport simulation framework: MATSim**

MATSim is an open-source software framework for simulating complex transportation systems. It was developed by Delft University of Technology and provides a comprehensive set of tools for modeling, analyzing, and optimizing transportation systems.

In the context of this proposal, the proposed optimization approach leverages MATSim as the agent-based transport simulation framework to model and analyze different transportation scenarios. By using MATSim, we can:

1. Model individual transport users (drivers, passengers, etc.) as separate agents, allowing for more accurate representation of their behavior and interactions.
2. Simulate dynamic traffic flow and transport processes, enabling the optimization of various aspects of transportation systems.

**MATSim Overview**

As mentioned in the original text, MATSim provides a wide range of features and tools for simulating complex transportation systems. Some key capabilities include:

1. Traffic modeling: MATSim can simulate the behavior of individual vehicles and pedestrian traffic, including their speed, acceleration, and braking.
2. Network analysis: The framework allows us to analyze and optimize the layout of roads, intersections, and other transport infrastructure.
3. Optimization: MATSim provides tools for optimizing various aspects of transportation systems, such as traffic flow, fuel consumption, emissions, and network performance.

**Proposed Optimization Approach**

Our proposed optimization approach will utilize MATSim to:

1. Model individual transport users as separate agents, capturing their behavior and interactions with the transportation system.
2. Simulate dynamic traffic flow and transport processes, allowing us to analyze and optimize various aspects of the transportation system.
3. Optimize different performance metrics, such as fuel consumption, emissions, and network performance.

By using MATSim as the agent-based simulation framework, we can leverage its extensive features and tools to create a comprehensive optimization model for transportation systems.
