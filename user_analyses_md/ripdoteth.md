Some tweets from the person into bigger context:

Tweet 1: The tweet starts with a news headline about institutions rushing to enter the stablecoin market, followed by a quote from the author on how Ethereum benefits the most. This sets the scene for discussing the topic of stablecoins and their growing popularity.
