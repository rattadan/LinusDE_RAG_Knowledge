5. Conclusion and Outlook
For Berlin, the simulation results have shown that a small service area and too low prices may result in an unwanted
mode shift effect from walk and bicycle to DRT.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The text appears to be discussing research on transit modes and their impact on urban areas. Specifically, it mentions two sets of simulation results:

1. For Berlin, the study found that small service areas and too low prices can lead to an unwanted mode shift from walking and cycling to Driving-to-Ride (DRT).
2. Additionally, Ihab Kaddoura et al.'s study referenced another set of simulation results for a different location, but it doesn't appear to be directly related to the conclusion drawn in Berlin.

However, without more context or information about what is being discussed in the second reference, it's difficult to provide further insight. If you have any additional details or clarification regarding Kaddoura et al.'s study, I'd be happy to try and help further.
