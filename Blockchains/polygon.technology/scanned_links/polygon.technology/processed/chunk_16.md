### Document Overview  
This content outlines AggDay, an event focused on solving blockchain interoperability challenges through collaborative technical discussions and workshops, featuring teams from diverse ecosystems and projects.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Interoperability**: The critical goal of blockchain systems to enable seamless data and value transfer across networks.  
- **Proof Aggregation**: A technique to combine proofs from multiple chains into a single, efficient proof for verification.  
- **zkVMs (Zero-Knowledge VMs)**: A framework for executing and verifying zero-knowledge proofs in a secure, tamper-proof environment.  
- **Prover Networks**: Systems that enable participants to validate data without revealing sensitive information.  
- **AggCave**: A collaborative workspace for developers to learn about proof aggregation, zkVMs, and custom ISAs.  
- **Agglayer and Zisk**: Core developer teams involved in advancing zkVM technologies.  
- **EthDenver**: The venue and date of AggDay (Feb 28, 2025, 12pm–6pm).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Event Details**:  
  - **Date**: February 28, 2025.  
  - **Time**: 12pm–6pm.  
  - **Location**: Venture X Denver Lodo.  
- **Sessions**:  
  - **Technical How-Tos**: Deep dives into proof aggregation, zkVMs, and custom ISAs.  
  - **Panelists**: Experts from Nil Foundation, Avail, Novanet, Lita Foundation, and Lagrange.

Cryptoâs era of scalability is upon us.Itâs not too late to sign up for Aggregation Day ETHDenver.pic.twitter.com/ibeHb9AArW

Everyone in crypto and Web3 knows that solving interoperability is one of the guiding lights of everything happening across the space. We also know that this is not an easy problem to solve.Â

AggDay brings together many dynamic and talented teams, communities, and ecosystems in pursuit of finding solutions to the tantalizing challenges of aggregation.

Programming for AggDay will be taking place on Friday, February 28, 2025, from 12pm-6pm in Venture X Denver Lodo . Hereâs a sample of whatâs on offer during AggDay:AggDay Panels:

Cohosted withZK Hack, AggCave is comfy hangout and workspace for devs to learn via osmosis and in-depth technical how-tos.Â Â

If youâre looking for a homebase to catch up on some work, take advantage of the free wifi, snacks, and swag. Also, fun!Â

AggCave Day 1:Day 1 will focus on proof aggregation, alongside the chill co-working space. That means technical sessions and deep-dive explainers for builders who want to understand how the magic happens.

Guests from Nil Foundation, Avail, Novanet, and other projects and ecosystems will walk through information about prover networks, proof acceleration, and trust-optimized interoperability.

AggCave, Day 2, is an exploration of zkVMs in an interoperable future.

Along with core developer teams from Agglayer and Zisk, guests from Lita Foundation and Lagrange will speak about Custom ISAs, zkVM benchmarking, and ZK-coprocessors.

If youâre going to be at ETHDenver, stop by the AggCave and AggDay to understand the frontier of crypto thatâs coming into view on the horizon.
