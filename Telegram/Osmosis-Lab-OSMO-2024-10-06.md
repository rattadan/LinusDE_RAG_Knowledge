## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I'll go through each message to identify the main issues and solutions discussed.

Starting from the top, osmosis_statbot links to the support site. Then hazzo12 mentions using Osmosis Dex, but there's an issue with Keplr's in-app swap freezing. They tried some steps but had to restart the app. kychuli suggests using the Dex app directly instead of the in-wallet swap, and also mentions reinstalling or restarting. hazzo12 clarifies they're on mobile Keplr, and the swap freezes as soon as they use it. Another user, captainmouse5, asks why Osmo's price went up. Some other messages about wallet preferences and a possible UI issue with creating supercharged pools. 

The main issue here is Keplr's swap function freezing on mobile. The key solutions proposed are using the Osmosis Dex app via browser or the interchain DApp navigation, and troubleshooting steps like restarting or reinstalling. Also, there's a mention of a UI problem with pool creation and a question about Osmo's price movement. The statbot also provides official wallet links and warns about scams.

I need to make sure the summary includes the problem, the suggested workarounds, and the other notable points without getting bogged down in less relevant messages like the price pump question. Also, highlight the decision to use Osmosis Dex despite the swap issue, and the security reminders from the statbot.

**Summary:**  
- **Keplr Swap Issue:** Users report freezing when using Keplr's in-app swap function on mobile. Workarounds suggested:  
  - Use Osmosis Dex directly via browser (`app.osmosis.zone`) or through the "Interchain DApp navigation" button in Keplr.  
  - Restart or reinstall the app, ensuring backups are secured.  
- **UI Problem:** A broken UI for creating supercharged pools is noted; team acknowledges and is addressing it.  
- **Wallet Support:** Keplr, Leap, and Cosmostation are confirmed as wallets supporting Osmosis. Keplr‚Äôs official resources (website, support, Twitter) are shared, with warnings against sharing seed phrases.  
- **Other:** A user questions Osmo‚Äôs recent price surge, and another humorously references scam attempts.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user provided a list of chat messages and wants the topics as a comma-separated list. 

First, I need to go through each message and identify what the main points are. Let's start with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's about directing users to the official support site. That seems like a support resource, so maybe "Support Resources" as a topic.

Next, hazzo12 says they're going to use Osmosis Dex. That's a positive statement about using the platform, so "Osmosis Dex Usage" could be a topic. Then, hazzo12 mentions issues with Keplr's in-app swap function freezing. That's a technical problem, so "Keplr Swap Function Freezing" is a possible topic here.

Another message from hazzo12 talks about backups and thanking someone. The mention of backups might relate to wallet security, so "Wallet Backup Importance" could be a topic. The user kychuli responds about making sure backups are handy if reinstalling, which reinforces that. 

kychuli also suggests using the Dex app instead of the in-wallet swap option. This is an alternative solution, so maybe "Alternative Swap Methods" is a topic. They mention visiting app.osmosis.zone, which is a specific action, but the broader topic might be using the Dex app.

hazzo12 again talks about mobile Keplr app freezing when using the swap function. This seems like a continuation of the previous issue, so the same "Keplr Swap Function Freezing" topic applies. 

Another user, kychuli, mentions possible relaying issues depending on tokens or chains. This could relate to transaction problems, so "Transaction Relaying Issues" might be a topic here. 

hazzo12 then warns about scammers DMing, so "Scam Awareness" is a topic. Earlier, they asked about Keplr's swap function issues, so that's part of the same thread.

captainmouse5 asks why Osmo's price increased. That's about market trends, so "Osmo Market Trends" or "Osmo Price Surge" could be a topic. 

Sirwenalot and BasementNodes discuss a DApp with good UX and a joke about North Koreans having graphs. The main point here is the need for a better UX DApp, so "D

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The user is asking about the sentiment of the provided text, which seems to be a chat log involving Osmosis, Keplr wallet, and other related topics.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a bot providing support links. That's straightforward and helpful, so probably neutral or positive. Since it's just information without emotional language, I'll lean neutral.

Next, hazzo12 at 21:57:26 says, "Any way. I'm going to use osmosis dex üôå". The emoji here is a positive one, showing enthusiasm. So positive sentiment here.

Then, hazzo12 at 21:56:46 mentions issues with Keplr's swap function freezing. The user is expressing a problem they're facing, which is negative. Words like "issue" and "freezing" indicate frustration.

At 21:54:22, hazzo12 is thanking someone and using positive emojis like üëåüôå. That's positive.

kychuli's message at 21:53:24 is a suggestion about backups. It's a neutral statement, offering advice without clear positive or negative words.

kychuli at 21:53:11 talks about their own experience being fine and suggests restarting or reinstalling. The mention of "personally mine is loading" might be neutral, but the advice could be seen as helpful, so maybe neutral.

kychuli at 21:52:31 gives specific instructions on using the Dex app instead of the swap function. This is a solution-oriented message, so neutral or positive. Since it's helping someone, maybe positive.

hazzo12 at 21:49:10 says they didn't try the desktop version. Neutral.

Same user at 21:48:53 clarifies they're on mobile. Neutral.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I need to read through all the messages and identify any parts where someone is suggesting doing something, making a decision, or planning a next step.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot providing a support link. That's probably not an action item but useful info. Then hazzo12 says they'll use Osmosis DEX, which is a decision. Next, hazzo12 mentions an issue with Keplr's swap function freezing. kychuli suggests trying the DEX app instead of the in-wallet swap, which is an action item. They also mention restarting or reinstalling the app, which are next steps. 

Later, kychuli advises making sure backups are handy before reinstalling, so that's a precautionary step. Metamo0n is looking for a DApp that shows token quantities over time, and BasementNodes suggests app.pulsar.finance. That's a recommendation, maybe an action item. 

There's a question about why Osmo pumped, but no decision there. Then user_6756228573 is asking about wallets supporting Osmosis, and GPKwee lists Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation. So those are possible action items for the user to try. The statbot also provides official links, which could be considered as resources to use.

I should list each of these points clearly, making sure to attribute them to the correct users and note what each is suggesting. Also, check if any steps are repeated or part of a sequence. For example, hazzo12's issue leads to kychuli's suggestions. Need to present each action item in a structured way without missing any key points.
</think>

Here are the extracted action items, decisions, and next steps from the chat:
