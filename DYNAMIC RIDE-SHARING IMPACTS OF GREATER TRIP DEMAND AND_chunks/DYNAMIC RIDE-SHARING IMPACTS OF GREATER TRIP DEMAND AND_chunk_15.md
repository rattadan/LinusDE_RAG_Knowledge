## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 15

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

During this process, each travelerâ€™s approximate delay (based on the estimated
initial routing time without detours) was measured throughout their trip. If an SAV occupant
experienced an instantaneous delay above a pre-defined threshold, new travelers are not added to
the SAV. Two metrics for delay thresholds are used: absolute and percentage delays. Absolute
delays or the magnitude of delays are important for short trips, where a 5-min trip can
accommodate a 3-min delay (60% increase). However, a 30-min trip is likely able to
accommodate more than 3 min of delay but no more than about 5% (or 6 min) of delay compared
to its no-detour travel time. Following the example, both absolute and percentage delays are
important since short trips are likely able to accommodate a larger percentage of delays while
longer trips may need to adhere to a lower percentage of delay.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the specific section:**

This chunk is explaining two technical details related to shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) routing and scheduling:

1. **Absolute and percentage delays:** The authors are discussing how SAVs should handle different types of delays based on their magnitude. Absolute delays, such as those caused by congestion or detours, require a threshold to prevent new travelers from being added to the Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV). Percentage delays, however, can be managed more flexibly.

The thresholds for absolute and percentage delays are defined:

* For short trips (less than 30 minutes), both absolute and percentage delays are important.
* For longer trips (more than 30 minutes), only absolute delays require a threshold, while percentage delays can accommodate a larger percentage of delays without an additional threshold.

**Connection to the surrounding context:**

This chunk builds upon the understanding that SAVs must balance short-term routing flexibility with long-term delay thresholds. The authors are addressing specific requirements for different types of trips (short and long) by applying these concepts:

* Short trips benefit from both absolute and percentage delays, as they can accommodate a larger percentage of delays without additional constraints.
* Long trips require more careful management to avoid too many delays, highlighting the importance of setting delay thresholds based on trip duration.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

The following requirements are explicitly stated in this chunk:

1. **SAV routing flexibility:** SAVs should be able to handle different types of delays (absolute and percentage) without additional constraints.
2. **Threshold settings:** The authors recommend setting delay thresholds based on trip duration for long trips.
3. **Constrained conditions:** Long trips require careful management to avoid too many delays, indicating that the threshold settings must balance flexibility with preventability.

These requirements highlight the importance of considering both short-term routing needs and long-term impact when designing SAV systems.
