The tone seems confident and persistent, as they mention staying steadfast in their belief.

Legitness evaluation. The account is @euler_mab, and the retweet is from @mcasto_. Both are real accounts, so the legitness is probably high. But I should check if there's any red flags, but the content doesn't seem suspicious.
