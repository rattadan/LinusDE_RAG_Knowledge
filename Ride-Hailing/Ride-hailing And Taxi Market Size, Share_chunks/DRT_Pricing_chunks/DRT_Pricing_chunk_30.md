## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 30

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

5. Conclusion and Outlook
For Berlin, the simulation results have shown that a small service area and too low prices may result in an unwanted
mode shift effect from walk and bicycle to DRT. In order to design a DRT concept which yields a reduction in car trips,
the service area should not be limited to the city-center area, and rather cover a typical commuting area. In addition,
the pricing scheme should have a relatively high minimum fee in order to make the DRT mode less attractive for shortdistance travelers who may as well walk or take the bicycle without facing any high additional costs. The simulation
experiments have also shown that even for a city-wide DRT service area and a minimum fee of 3.00 EUR, without
car tolling only 11% of the DRT users are shifted from the car mode. With car tolling, the simulation experiments
yield a larger share of users switching from car to DRT.
