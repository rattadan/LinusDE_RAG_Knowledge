## Chunk 24

**Original Text:**

By requiring both the passenger and the driver to send deposits to the escrow
account, the NRIDE ecosystem ensures that there is a mutual agreement and incentive to complete the ride. Confirmation {
String id;

String acceptanceID;
}

2.2.7. Termination
Once a "Confirmation" message has been sent by the driver and received by the passenger, either party can
send a "Termination" message to signify that the ride request has been canceled or completed. This termination message may include a secret phrase that allows the other party to redeem their deposit, as well as
any cancellation fees that may apply. The use of a secret phrase helps to ensure that the refund process is secure and only authorized parties can
redeem their deposit.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing the details of an e-hailing or ride-sharing service, likely using the name NRIDE, which stands for "Neighborhood Ride Insurance Diversification". Here's a breakdown of what each section says:

1. **Deposit requirements**: The requirement to send deposits to an escrow account is a common practice in various forms of transportation and insurance services. It ensures that both parties (passenger and driver) have some level of financial protection before the ride is confirmed.

2. **Confirmation process**: 
   - **Passenger ID and acceptance ID**: These are likely unique identifiers used by the service to track the passenger's request and confirm their booking.
   - **Driver confirmation**: This is an expected step where the driver receives a confirmation message from the passenger, signaling that the ride is confirmed.

3. **Termination process**:
   - **Cancellation messages**: The system allows either party (driver or passenger) to send a termination message to cancel the ride request. This message may include a secret phrase and any applicable cancellation fees.
   - **Secret phrases and refund protection**: The use of a secret phrase is designed to secure the refund process by limiting access to authorized parties only, ensuring that the refund is made in accordance with the terms agreed upon when booking.

This system seems to be implementing a multi-party agreement where both the passenger and driver are incentivized through deposits to complete their rides. The ability to cancel or change requests mid-ride provides flexibility for passengers while protecting drivers' finances and adhering to service requirements.
