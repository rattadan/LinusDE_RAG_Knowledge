getting started, making it easy for drivers to onboard during and after the event. Lastly, we will take the

virtual summit, we will follow up with drivers who attended to answer any questions and provide
additional support. Ride-hailing vehicle ads
As part of our GTM strategy for the initial launch of the nRide application in the UK, we will leverage

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you've provided a summary of your virtual summit strategy for launching the nRide application in the UK. Here's a breakdown of what I've extracted:

* The summit will also cover topics like signing up, getting started, and onboarding drivers, to make the process easy and smooth for those involved.
* Additionally, there will be an opportunity for drivers to provide feedback on how to improve the nRide stack after the event.
* Another key aspect is promoting ride-hailing vehicle ads to reach potential customers directly.

I've omitted any specific details about the driving partners or their role in the process. If you'd like to share more information about this, I'd be happy to help.
