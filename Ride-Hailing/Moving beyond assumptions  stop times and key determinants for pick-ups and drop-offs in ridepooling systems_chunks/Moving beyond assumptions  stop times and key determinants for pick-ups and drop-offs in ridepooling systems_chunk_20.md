Data collection
Aiming to gather stop time data and delve into the factors influencing PUDO events, we
employed an empirical data collection approach. Rather than relying on automated tracking systems or video surveillance, we chose to conduct direct observations by riding inside
a sprinti vehicle during its regular operating hours. This methodology allowed us to closely
scrutinise various factors and conditions that might affect the stop process. To achieve
this, we have arranged for an observer person to accompany a driver during their shift to
silently monitor and record PUDO events. That necessitated blocking a single seat in the
fleet vehicle to accommodate the observer, temporarily reducing the vehicleâ€™s capacity to
five passengers during observation periods. The capacity reduction did not result in any
complications in service operations during the observation period. The observer was seated
in a place where he did not interfere with other passengers boarding and alighting.
