## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 79

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Figs. 3 and 4
compare the service rates and waiting times of the best assignment
strategy in different settings for fleet sizes ùëâ ‚àà {30, 100, 300}. It is
clearly evident that bigger fleets act much more efficiently and can
therefore provide a higher service rate and shorter waiting times. In
general, the difference between small and big fleets in terms of service
rate is bigger for less utilized fleets as well as for a more restricted
maximum waiting time. Without a maximum waiting time constraint,
the average waiting time has to be minimized. Here, highly utilized
fleets benefit more from an increased fleet size compared to less utilized
fleets. The main reason for the efficiency increase is that, with more
vehicles distributed over the same service area, the nearest vehicle to
any given point is closer than it would be with a small fleet. 10

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text discusses the efficiency and effectiveness of larger fleets in shared autonomous ride-hailing systems.

**Technical Details:**

* The comparison between different fleet sizes (30, 100, 300 vehicles) using figures 3 and 4.
* Service rates and waiting times for each fleet size are compared.
* The main reason for efficiency increase is that more vehicles distributed over the same service area results in a closer nearest vehicle to any given point.

**Context:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing technical details on how different fleet sizes affect the performance of ride-hailing systems.
2. Connecting this information to the broader topic of optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets, which is discussed earlier in the reference text.
3. Highlighting specific requirements and conditions mentioned, such as the need for a maximum waiting time constraint to minimize average waiting times.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

The main requirement mentioned in this chunk is that there needs to be a maximum waiting time constraint to ensure efficient operation of ride-hailing systems. This constraint aims to minimize average waiting times by redistributing vehicles over the same service area, which results in a closer nearest vehicle to any given point.
