I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

These two cases
should be kept in mind when comparing repositioning strategies against
the nearest strategy as the only benchmark, especially for completely
machine learning-based approaches, which usually start their training
progress with the random strategy. In the remainder of this section, we present additional approaches
that reposition the whole (non-serving) fleet in regular intervals of ùõøùëÖ . Since these approaches create a plan for the whole fleet, they are not
used whenever a vehicle enters the null state. Here, unless otherwise
stated, the vehicle is provisionally sent to its nearest parking lot until
the next repositioning epoch occurs. Match missed requests. The match missed requests strategy is a
slightly modified version of the one proposed by Alonso-Mora et al. (2017) for a ride-sharing application. In their study, it is possible that
after an assignment epoch, there are still unmatched open requests
and unassigned available vehicles.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk describes two cases: machine learning-based repositioning strategies and nearest-neighbor approaches.

**1. Technical details, parameters, or processes:**
The text mentions the following specific technical concepts:

* Spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network (Geng et al., 2019)
* Deep RL (Jiao et al., 2021)
* Approximate dynamic programming (Al-Kanj et al., 2020)
* Robust vehicle rebalancing in ride-hailing systems (Guo et al., 2021)
* Empty-car routing for ridesharing (Dandl et al., 2019)

**2. Connection to or building upon the surrounding context:**
The text builds upon the existing discussion on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, which is organized by their focus areas such as simulation and modeling, dynamic dispatch and repositioning, and rebalancing strategies.

**3. Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**
The text mentions the following requirements:

* The approach should be suitable for completely machine learning-based approaches
* The method should start with the random strategy, but only use it when necessary to generate a plan for the whole fleet

Additionally, the text requires consideration of the vehicle's null state and the possibility of missed requests after an assignment epoch.
