There's no obvious scam activity, though users should still exercise caution with new DeFi protocols.

Contextual interpretation:
As an apparent ambassador for EuclidProtocol, the author aims to build awareness and attract users to the Testnet phase. The emphasis on "no bridge" cross-chain swaps suggests positioning the project as solving DeFi's bridge security issues. By offering personal DM support, the author fosters trust and direct community connections.
