## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I need to go through each message and identify the main topics.

Starting from the top, there's a question from xtxinternational asking if Osmosis is just an AMM/DEX or also a Layer 1. griffin_web3 responds that it's a Layer 1 in the Cosmos ecosystem. That's a key point: Osmosis is a Layer 1 blockchain, not just a DEX. Then xtxinternational asks if developers can build dapps on Osmosis, which might be another key point. I should check if there's a direct answer to that. The next messages from Svansy mention Osmosis being the future of friendship, which seems more like a personal opinion, so maybe not key.

Then there's a discussion about Noble chain needing an explorer. Svansy says Noble is in urgent need of a good explorer, and another user mentions other explorers being terrible. So the key here is the need for better explorers on Noble. 

Moving on, there's a user asking about slippage settings when using Skip or Squid. Martyvb wants an option to adjust slippage because the default settings (1.5-3%) can add up when swapping assets on origin and destination chains. That's a feature request related to cross-chain swaps. 

Another part is about Levana Perps trading with $OSMO being popular. Crytekllc mentions using indicators like RSI, support/resistance, and trend lines. So Levana Perps is a notable application on Osmosis.

There's a mention of burning OSMO tokens. User_7164487109 asks why they're burning OSMO, and jasbanza says it's a normal burn from protorev funds. So OSMO burning is part of their process.

Also, some users discuss issues with SquidRouter, like transactions taking a long time or not arriving. Svansy tried from Osmosis but couldn't, while from Noble it worked but delayed. They mention checking Squid's Discord for support. So there's a technical issue with cross-chain transactions.

Then there's a question about Chainscope, an explorer. Profesija asks who's behind it and if they're validators. Kychuli links it to a

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key topics are.

Starting from the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's about support resources. Then Svansy says "Osmosis is the future of friendship" ‚Äì that seems like a promotional statement, maybe community sentiment. 

xtxinternational asks if Osmosis is a layer 1 or just an AMM/DEX. Then griffin_web3 confirms it's a layer 1 in Cosmos. So Layer 1 blockchain and AMM/DEX are topics here. Another user asks if developers can build dapps on Osmosis, which points to dApp development.

Svansy mentions needing more chains and a better explorer, and others talk about Chainscope explorer. So blockchain explorer is a topic. There's a mention of Noble chain needing an explorer urgently, so maybe cross-chain interoperability or specific chains like Noble.

Technical issues come up: ndcast says "y levana down" and others mention problems with Levana Protocol. Also, there's a discussion about squidrouter being slow and slippage settings. So topics here are network performance, transaction delays, and slippage settings.

jasbanza and Svansy discuss connecting wallets, cache clearing, and wallet connectivity issues. That's another topic. 

Crytekllc mentions Levana Perps trading with $OSMO, so decentralized trading platforms. Also, trading strategies using indicators like RSI, support/resistance, trend lines. 

There's a question about Terra grants funding Chainscope, so funding sources. BasementNodes mentions Terra paying grants and validators on Osmosis, so validators and grants. 

Svansy comments on projects starting on Terra but moving to Cosmos, indicating project migration. 

The user also asks about burning OSMO tokens related to Babylon integration, so token burning and cross-chain security. 

Other topics include community support, user experience with explorers, and specific projects like Levana Protocol and SquidRouter. 

I need to make sure I cover all these points without repeating. Let me list them out: Osmosis support site, Layer 1 blockchain, AMM/DEX, dApp development, Chainscope explorer, Noble chain, cross-chain interoperability,

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people and times. I need to go through each one and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, the osmosis_statbot messages are just providing support links. They don't have any emotional tone, so those are neutral. Then there's Svansy saying "yes all the times üëç" which is clearly positive. The emoji adds to that. 

xtxinternational asks if developers can build dapps on Osmosis and if it's a layer 1. Those are factual questions, so neutral. But then griffin_web3 answers that it's a layer 1 in the Cosmos ecosystem. That's a positive statement because it confirms a feature, but since it's just stating a fact, maybe neutral? Hmm, depends on context. If the question is seeking confirmation, the answer might be seen as positive support.

Svansy's message "Osmosis is the future of friendship" sounds positive. It's a bit odd, but the sentiment is positive. Then griffin_web3 again confirms it's a layer 1, so same as before. 

xtxinternational's initial question about Osmosis being AMM/DEX or layer 1 is neutral. The following messages from Svansy asking to use profits to pump bags is positive, but Dave331 tells them not to flex profits, which is negative. 

ndcast's "nvm working again" is neutral because it's resolving an issue. The previous messages from ndcast about Jelena ordered online seem negative if Jelena is a problem, but without more context, maybe neutral. 

Profesija mentions needing an explorer and BasementNodes tags Jelena. Not sure about sentiment here. Kzzyt says have them reach out, which is neutral. Svansy again asks to add more chains with emojis, which is positive because of the plea and emojis. 

Griffin_web3 suggests asking in a Telegram group, which is neutral. Ndcast asks why Levana is down, which is negative. Martyvb has a detailed request for a feature, so that's positive as it's constructive feedback. 

Svansy's comments about squid being slow and Osmosis causing delays might be negative. Jasbanza's message about an update is neutral. Osmosis_news shares a link, neutral.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and see if there's anything that implies a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a next step in a process.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a link to the support site. That's more of an informational message, not an action item. Then Svansy's message is just an emoji, so nothing there. Xtxinternational asks if developers can build dapps on Osmosis. The next message from xtxinternational asks if it's a layer 1. Then griffin_web3 confirms it's a layer 1 in the Cosmos ecosystem. So maybe that's a decision or clarification, but not an action item. The user might need to know that Osmosis is a layer 1, but I should check if there's a task associated with that.

Svansy says Osmosis is the future of friendship. That's a statement, not an action. Then another message from Svansy about using profits to pump his bags, which is a request but not sure if it's actionable. Dave331 tells someone not to flex profits. Ndcast messages about Jelena, but it's unclear. Then profesija tags someone, maybe not relevant. 

Looking at BasementNodes at 16:39: "@jelena pls" ‚Äì maybe a request for someone named Jelena to do something, but without context, it's hard to tell. Kzzyt says "have them reach out to us" ‚Äì that's a possible action item. Someone needs to contact "them" to get in touch with kzzyt's group. 

Svansy at 16:32 mentions Noble needing an explorer urgently. That could be a next step for the team to address. At 16:31, he asks to add more chains, which is a request. Martyvb at 14:11 has a detailed request about adjusting slippage settings when using Skip or Squid. This is a clear action item: the user is asking the team to add an option to adjust slippage. 

Then there's a discussion about Levana being down, and griffin_web3 suggests asking in their Telegram group. So the
