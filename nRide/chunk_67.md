## Chunk 67

**Original Text:**

By putting the power of decision-making in the hands of token holders, nRide aims to create a platform that
is truly owned and operated by its users. The decentralized nature of the DAO ensures that no single entity
or group can dominate the decision-making process, and that the future of nRide is shaped by the community as a whole. 7. Roadmap
The nRide project was founded in October 2021 at the Gitcoin GR11 Hackathon sponsored by NKN, where
it won a prize for its innovative approach to peer-to-peer ride-hailing. At the beginning, the idea was to
build an uber-like service where drivers and riders connect directly to one another, without relying on a central third party.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're providing information about nRide, which appears to be a blockchain-based platform for peer-to-peer ride-hailing, with a focus on community ownership and decentralized decision-making.

To summarize:

* The platform is owned and operated by token holders, rather than a centralized entity.
* The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) ensures that no single entity can dominate the decision-making process.
* The roadmap outlines the project's goals, including building an Uber-like service without relying on a central third party.

It sounds like nRide is aiming to create a more democratic and community-driven platform, where users have a say in how it operates. This approach has the potential to empower riders and drivers alike, rather than just a small group of stakeholders.
