<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 5 keywords or tags for better postprocessing, focusing on the most distinctive patterns from the provided text. 

First, I need to understand the content. The text is a series of tweets from someone (Meme Coin Mania) discussing themes like discernment, faith, the heart being deceitful, the importance of fixing eyes on eternity, and the contrast between digital tools and eternal truths. There's a lot about avoiding illusions, trusting faith over algorithms, and the role of the ledger.

So, the key themes here are: discernment, faith, eternal truths, algorithmic traps, and the heart's deceit. These are the main ideas. The user wants tags that capture these themes concisely. 

I need to make sure the tags are distinct. Let's see: "Discernment" and "Faith" are central. Then "Eternal Truths" and "Algorithmic Traps" are also important. The last one is "Heart's Deceit" which is a specific point. 

So the five tags could be: Discernment, Faith, Eternal Truths, Algorithmic Traps, Heart's Deceit. These cover the main themes and are concise. I need to check if they're unique enough. Yes, each is a distinct aspect of the content. 

I should also ensure they're in a format that's easy to use for postprocessing, like hashtags. So the final answer would be these five tags.
