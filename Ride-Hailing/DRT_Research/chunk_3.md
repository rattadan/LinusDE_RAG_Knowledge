## Chunk 3

**Original Text:**

Abstract
The operating cost of a demand responsive transit (DRT) system strictly depends on the quality of service that it offers to its users. An operating agency seeks to minimize operating costs while maintaining the quality of service while users experience costs associated with scheduling, waiting, and traveling within the system. In this paper, an analytical model is employed to approximate the agency's operating cost for running a DRT system with dynamic demand and the total generalized cost that users experience as a result of the operating decisions. The approach makes use of Vickrey's (1969) congestion theory to model the dynamics of the DRT system in the equilibrium condition and approximate the generalized cost for users when the operating capacity is inadequate to serve the time-dependent demand over the peak period without excess delay. The efficiency of the DRT system can be improved by optimizing one of three parameters that define the agency's operating decision: (1) the operating capacity of the system, (2) the number of passengers that have requested a pick-up and are awaiting service, and (3) the distribution of requested times for service from the DRT system.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This is not a complete paper, but rather an abstract. However, I can provide you with a summary of the content:

The article discusses a demand responsive transit (DRT) system's operating costs and the factors that influence them. An analytical model is developed to approximate the agency's operating cost for running the DRT system under dynamic demand conditions. The model incorporates Vickrey's congestion theory, which is used to model the dynamics of the DRT system in equilibrium condition. The article also introduces three parameters that can be optimized by the agency to improve the efficiency of its DRT system: operating capacity, the number of passengers waiting for service, and the distribution of requested times.

If you would like me to provide a summary of the content in bullet points or discuss the specifics of the model and optimization parameters further, please let me know.
