**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

This means that a userâ€™s voting power decays over time in steps, and behaves like this:

Note: The Pilot Round of Hydro will have certain restrictions around lockups. Specifically, users will not be allowed in the first round to lock for more than 1 month. To learn more about the Pilot Rounds please read the Pilot Rounds documentation. Key Points:

Locking for longer periods (e.g., 12 months) grants more voting power than shorter periods. As lock-ups age, voting power decreases, requiring users to refresh or extend their lock-up to maintain influence. ## Unlocking Your ATOM
-------------------

On the Lockups page, users can unlock any expired lockups. Unlocking will initiate the process of converting your Liquid Staking Module (LSM) shares back into ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, returning them to their original staked position. ### How It Works:
-------------

Select Expired Lockup: Navigate to the Lockups page and locate any lockups that have expired.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis**

1.  **Exact Technical Details and Parameters**: This text chunk explains the voting power decay process in Hydro. 
    *   The voting power decays over time in steps.
    *   Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.
    *   Each lockup duration grants a different amount of voting power, with longer lockups granting more voting power.
    *   As lock-ups age, voting power decreases.
2.  **Context Connection and Building**: This chunk is part of the Hydro platform's documentation, focusing on the mechanics of voting power decay. This section builds upon the "Lockups and Voting Power" section by explaining how lock-up durations impact voting power and how users can unlock expired lockups to recover their staked ATOM.
3.  **Specific Requirements and Constraints**:
    *   During the Pilot Round, users are restricted from locking their ATOM for more than 1 month.
    *   Users can unlock any expired lockups on the Lockups page, converting their Liquid Staking Module (LSM) shares back into ATOM on the Cosmos Hub.

**Key Takeaways**

*   Voting power in Hydro decays over time in steps and depends on the lock-up duration.
*   Locking ATOM for longer periods grants more voting power, but voting power decreases as lock-ups age.
*   Users can unlock expired lockups to regain their staked ATOM, but there are restrictions in place during the Pilot Round.
