Roadmap
The nRide project was founded in October 2021 at the Gitcoin GR11 Hackathon sponsored by NKN, where
it won a prize for its innovative approach to peer-to-peer ride-hailing. At the beginning, the idea was to
build an uber-like service where drivers and riders connect directly to one another, without relying on a central third party. After the hackathon, NKN accepted to fund a more advanced prototype, and from there the

-11scope expanded to building a more generic protocol and a suite of open-source software packages that
would allow the creation of compatible ride-hailing apps sharing a common pool of users. The first whitepaper outlining this vision was written in early 2022, and the code has been under development since then. Currently, the nRide mobile application, implemented in Flutter, is in private beta on the
Apple and Android app stores.
