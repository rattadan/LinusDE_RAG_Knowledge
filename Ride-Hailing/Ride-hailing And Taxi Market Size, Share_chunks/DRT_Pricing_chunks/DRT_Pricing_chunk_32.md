## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 32

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

Key references include:

- Fourie's chapter on multi-modeling in MATSim 
- Bösch et al. on cost analysis of AVs
- Horni et al. on the MATSim framework

The paper contributes to research on simulating autonomous mobility services, integrating various transport modes in city-wide models, and evaluating welfare impacts. If you need more details or specific citations from the text, let me know!

Furthermore the base case will be extended by
other modes of transportation, such as car sharing and conventional taxis, which are also highly relevant for the modal
shift towards DRT. Acknowledgements
