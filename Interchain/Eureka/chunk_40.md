## Chunk 40

**Original Text:**

Tokenfactory tokens are created with the tokenfactory module. They’re designed to have the best of both worlds of CW20 and native tokens:

Like CW20s, they’re permissionless and users can create new ones just by submitting transactions — no need to modify the chain’s state machine
Like native tokens, they’re directly compatible with IBC out-of-the-box, and the bank module manages their balances + transferring functionality. This combination of traits leads many to see tokenfactory as a strict improvement on CW20 that devs should prefer in the vast majority of cases. We strongly agree with this conclusion. Unlike CW20s , tokenfactory tokens have no limitations in the cross-chain functionality Skip Go API can offer for them.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

They've successfully leveraged the best features of both CW20 and native tokens, creating a hybrid solution that offers several advantages over traditional permissionless tokens. The key benefits include:

* Permissionlessness: Tokenfactory tokens allow users to create new ones without needing to modify the chain's state machine.
* Native token compatibility: They can be easily integrated with the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol out-of-the-box, making it seamless for banks and other financial institutions.

By combining these features, tokenfactory tokens provide a robust solution that caters to various use cases.
