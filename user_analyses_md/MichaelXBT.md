Putting these tweets into bigger context of the author's intentions:

MichaelXBT is clearly positioning himself as a crypto trading expert who can help followers identify profitable opportunities. His tweets follow a pattern:
1. Present a bold prediction that contradicts the prevailing market sentiment
2. Reference past instances where he claims to have successfully made similar contrarian bets
3. Use hype-inducing language ("easy mode," "huge opportunities daily," "future millionaires")
4. Encourage followers to prepare for these opportunities
5. Suggest that doubters will ultimately be proven wrong

By mentioning shorts being "turned to fuel for the breakout pump" and referring to people thanking him for their service, MichaelXBT appears to be cultivating a persona of market dominance and inevitability of success for those following his advice.

He builds a narrative of himself as an expert who sees market truths others don't, who has a track record of success, and who is altruistically sharing insights with followers. This creates a sense of community and shared purpose among his followers who want to believe in this vision.

The fact that he mentions "my yellow lines" suggests he may have custom technical indicators or charting methods that he sells or promotes to followers, positioning himself as having proprietary knowledge that gives him an edge in market predictions.
