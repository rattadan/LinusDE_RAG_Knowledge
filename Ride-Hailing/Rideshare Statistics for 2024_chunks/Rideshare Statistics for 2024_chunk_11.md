public transit (in billions)	Number of Uber trips completed worldwide (in billions)
2020	4.71	5.03

Many people switched from public transportation to Uber during the pandemic to limit their interactions with other passengers. And although President Joe Biden declared the pandemic “over” in September 2022, its effects on behavior and habits still linger, as many people still choose Uber over public transportation. Microtransit: On-Demand Public Transportation
Not everyone can afford rideshares, but many don’t have access to convenient public transportation like bus lines or light rails. A new form of transportation has emerged to fill this gap, an amalgamation of both rideshare services and public transportation: microtransit, otherwise known as on-demand public transportation. Microtransit is a more affordable version of a rideshare service. It’s popular in suburban and rural areas, as well as smaller cities without larger public transportation infrastructures.
