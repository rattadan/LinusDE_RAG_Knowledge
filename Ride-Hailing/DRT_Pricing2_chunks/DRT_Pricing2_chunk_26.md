## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 26

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

As we are considering deterministic travel times, the
final waiting time of assigned customers can already be computed when
the assignment happens. The reward is the negative sum of the waiting
times for each assigned customer in seconds. Rejected requests receive
a value equal to the maximum waiting time 𝑇𝑊 . 𝑅𝑅 determines the
monetary reward, which is calculated using the reward received for
serving the assigned requests as well as the costs associated with all
distances driven by all vehicles. All three objectives can be used at
the same time and can be weighted via appropriately dimensionalized
parameters 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝛾. If only one objective is to be considered, the
other weights can be set to 0. If a lexicographical order is preferred
instead, the weights can be adapted accordingly. Note in this context
that the number of served requests is limited by the total number of
requests 𝑅 per episode and the sum of waiting times over all requests
is limited by 𝑇𝑊 ⋅ 𝑅.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

* The chunk refers to a section in the text that describes the objective function used for determining the reward, which is the negative sum of the waiting times for each assigned customer.
* The objective function is defined as `Reward = -sum(Waiting_times)`, where `Waiting_times` represents the total waiting time for all customers assigned during an episode (i.e., a single trip).
* The chunk also mentions that three objectives can be combined using appropriately dimensionalized parameters: the negative sum of waiting times, the maximum waiting time (`𝑇𝑊`) received by rejected requests (`𝑅𝑅`), and the costs associated with distances driven by all vehicles.

**Context Connection:**

* This chunk is connected to the surrounding context through its discussion of optimization models for managing fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals. The text mentions various dynamic optimization models that have been proposed, which suggests that this chunk is part of a broader analysis of ride-hailing system operations.
* The text also references other studies and research areas (e.g., autonomous taxis, agent-based modeling) that are relevant to the topic of shared autonomous vehicle fleets.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

* None explicitly mentioned in this chunk. However, it's worth noting that the context implies a need for mathematical models or optimization algorithms that can handle complex systems with multiple objectives, limited resource constraints (e.g., time, money), and uncertain demand patterns. The use of machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning is also hinted at, which may require careful consideration of constraints like data quality and availability.

Overall, this chunk provides technical details about the objective function used for determining rewards in ride-hailing systems, while connecting it to broader research contexts and requirements for managing complex systems with multiple objectives.
