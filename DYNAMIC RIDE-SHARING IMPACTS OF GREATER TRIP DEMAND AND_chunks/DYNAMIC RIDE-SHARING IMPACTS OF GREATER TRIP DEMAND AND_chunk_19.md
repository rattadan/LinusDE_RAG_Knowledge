## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 19

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Hierarchical clustering created a dendrogram (i.e., a tree structure) of clusters with each
location belonging to its own cluster downstream (at the base of the tree’s root system). Moving
upwards, locations were clustered based on proximity. With this type of agglomerative
clustering, a predefined stop spacing ds was used to obtain the required groups of stops that are
no more than ds miles apart. By sampling centrally from these groups, the resulting set of stops
used are stabled and are used throughout this analysis. Since, PUDOs are envisioned here to
improve a fleet’s DRS potential, SAVs serve trips from and to PUDOs, and then idle at these
locations until a new request is matched. Since the locations used in POLARIS comes from
underlying buildings data and networks from the appropriate Metropolitan Planning
Organization (MPO), there is a higher degree of aggregation in the periphery of the regions
simulated.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides technical details on hierarchical clustering, a data analysis technique used to group similar elements within a dataset.

1. The exact technical details mentioned are:
	* Hierarchical clustering: A tree structure where locations are grouped based on proximity.
	* Dendrogram (tree structure): A visual representation of clusters as a hierarchy of nodes.
	* Agglomerative clustering: A type of hierarchical clustering that groups similar elements by merging them into larger clusters.
	* Stop spacing (ds): The maximum distance between stops, which is used to determine the number and grouping of stops in the analysis.
2. This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context in the following ways:
	* It provides a technical explanation of hierarchical clustering, which was likely introduced by researchers in the field of transportation systems.
	* It establishes the scope of the analysis, which involves improving dispatching rates (DRS) potential and optimizing vehicle assignment (SAVs).
	* It explains how PUDOs (Planned Unit Development Opportunities) are used to improve fleet performance.
3. Specific requirements or conditions mentioned in this chunk include:
	* The use of underlying buildings data and networks from the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), indicating that the analysis is taking place within a specific geographical framework.

Overall, this text chunk provides technical information about hierarchical clustering and its application in analyzing traffic stop distribution optimization (PUDOs) for shared autonomous vehicle fleets.
