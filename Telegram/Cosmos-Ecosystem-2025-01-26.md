## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify the important information.

Starting from the top, iconoicono mentions that the distribution date was changed to 2027 with a 10% release in February. That's a key point about a token distribution schedule. Then LordAlamar asks if they reneged on the checker, which might refer to a previous commitment or airdrop. iconoicono also says "they are doing nft now," indicating a shift towards NFTs.

Looking at other messages, there's a lot of discussion about ATOM and OM tokens. CoinhallBot provides price data for ATOM and OM, showing market stats. Kartoffelfren and m1ndl3ss666 are arguing about whether Solana is overrated, which might not be a decision but shows community sentiment. 

The Sputnik Network collaboration with Pigeon Bandits and Mad Scientists for NFT drops and StreamDrop is mentioned multiple times. Also, the Ambassador Program with 25 million SIGNAL tokens allocated is a key decision. The Centrifuge quest platform tasks are available, and there's a mention of applying for a Contributor role soon.

Ibreaktwo is asking about staking OM, adding the chain on Leap wallet, and checking balances. There's a quiz event by OmniFlixNetwork and ArchiesNFT with rewards. The Telegram mini-app platform is enforcing TON Connect as the exclusive protocol, which affects other blockchains like Solana and their apps.

Other points include the postponement of a project to March 2025, a user rugged a token on pump.fun, and some price discussions. Also, some users are banned or muted by bots, which might not be crucial for the summary unless it's about moderation decisions.

I need to filter out the noise, like random comments, memes, and focus on actual updates, decisions, collaborations, airdrops, and technical changes. The main entities involved are Cosmos ecosystem projects like Mantra Chain, Sputnik Network, OmniFlix, and discussions around token distributions, NFT collaborations, wallet integrations, and quiz events. Also, the TON Connect protocol enforcement by Telegram mini-apps is a significant decision affecting other blockchains.

So the summary should include:

1. Mantra Chain (OM)

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by going through each message to understand what they're talking about.

First, there's a mention of a date change for distribution to 2027 with a 10% in February. That seems related to some kind of token or airdrop distribution. Then someone asks if they reneged on the checker, which might be a typo for "airdrop" or "distribution" again. Another message says "they are doing nft now," so NFTs are a topic. 

There's a discussion about the OM airdrop and when it will be released. So OM (maybe Mantra Chain's OM token) and airdrops are topics. The user also mentions Indian devs, so maybe that's a point, but I'm not sure if it's a main topic. 

Someone says "mantra scam," which could be a topic. Then there's a question about a bot for IBC showing channels between chains, so IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) and bots are topics. 

"watch tomorrow" and "wen alpha" are phrases that might relate to upcoming events or releases. A user created a token on Pump.fun and rugged themselves, so Pump.fun and rug pulls are topics. 

There's a lot of back-and-forth between users about Solana being overrated, ATOM vs. SOL, fanboys, and ecosystem profits. So Solana (SOL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), fanboyism, and ecosystem comparisons are topics. 

Messages about adding OM Mantra mainnet on Leap wallet, claiming balances, and staking OM. So wallet connectors, staking, and specific chains like Mantra-1 are topics. 

A birthday mention for an NFT project, collaborations between Sputnik Network and others for StreamDrops and NFTDrops, Ambassador Programs. So NFT collaborations, StreamDrops, Ambassador Programs, and specific projects like Sputnik Network are topics. 

Discussions about banning APIs for bots, mini apps, and TON Connect being the exclusive protocol. So API restrictions, mini apps, TON Connect, and Telegram's platform policies might be a topic. 

Quiz events by OmniFlix and ArchiesNFT with rewards, which could be a community engagement topic.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

First, there's a lot of discussion about cryptocurrency projects like ATOM, OM, Solana, and some NFTs. The users are talking about airdrops, distribution dates, price changes, and various projects. 

Looking at individual messages:

- "they changed the date of districution I think it is in 2027 or something but there is 10% in february or something" ‚Äì This seems neutral, just stating a change in schedule.
- "What really? So they reneged on the checker?" ‚Äì Negative, indicating disappointment or betrayal.
- "they are doing nft now" ‚Äì Neutral, just a statement of fact.
- "I love this pool" ‚Äì Positive.
- "mantra scam" ‚Äì Negative.
- "What became of the OM airdrop? Is there info as to when it will be released?" ‚Äì Neutral, asking for information.
- The messages from CoinhallBot with price data show some negative trends (like -0.13%, -0.87%, -6.15%), which might contribute to a negative sentiment, but they're factual so maybe neutral.
- "Sometimes, checking in on clowns comforting each other really entertains me. Meanwhile, Solana 'overrated' is making profit every day." ‚Äì Negative towards Solana, but the user is mocking others, so mixed.
- "ser solanas mc is high as fuck, they are printing like there is no tomorrow. 90% from traffic is scam and shit like aj¬¥s scams" ‚Äì Negative towards Solana.
- "haha hold your atomballs and enjoy your days at the bottom. we getting high on sol 'overrated'." ‚Äì Negative towards ATOM, positive towards Solana.
- "Atom can only go up when you sell" ‚Äì Sarcastic, negative.
- "New collaboration!" messages seem positive about partnerships.
- "Sputnik Network Ambassador Program is live! üòç" ‚Äì Positive.
- "Hope not $0.1 in 2027" ‚Äì Negative, expressing concern about low value.
- "millionaire in waiting ü§£üòÑ" ‚Äì Positive, albeit with some sarcasm.
- "All mini apps... must implement TON Connect..." ‚Äì Neutral,

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify any that indicate a task to do, a decision made, or a plan for the future.

Starting with the earliest messages. The user "profesija" mentions creating a token on Pump Fun and selling it after 30 minutes. That seems like a completed action, not a next step. Then there's some back-and-forth about Solana and ATOM, with users mocking each other's choices. Not much in terms of actionable items there.

Looking at "unknown" messages, there's a mention of a new collaboration between Sputnik Network and Pigeon Bandits, including a StreamDrop and NFTDrop. The message says to check the docs and share the news. That's a next step for the community: applying for the Ambassador Program, visiting the quest platform, and sharing on social media. Also, the Ambassador Program details are provided with links, so that's an action item for those interested.

Another "unknown" message talks about the Ambassador Program being live with 25 million $SIGNAL allocated. They mention applying for the Contributor role once the form is announced and reaching out for collaborations. So, next steps here include applying when the form is available and contacting @wlkatja for ideas.

Then there's "SuperEra" announcing a quiz on OmniFlix and ArchiesNFT collaboration. The next steps here are participating in the quiz rounds at specified times and claiming rewards. The times and links to Discord servers are important details.

"Ibreaktwo" and others are discussing staking OM, adding chains on Leap wallet, and checking balances. The action items here would be steps to add Mantra mainnet on Leap, connecting wallets, and verifying balances.

"Rattadan" shares a link about TON Connect becoming the exclusive protocol for Telegram mini apps, requiring implementation within a month. That's a decision and a next step for developers using mini apps to switch to TON Connect.

"Al_FagheZ" asks about a bot for IBC channels. The action item here is for someone (maybe Max) to provide a link to the bot if it's available.

"MissRose_bot" has several messages about muting and banning users, but those are administrative actions, not relevant to general next steps unless someone needs
