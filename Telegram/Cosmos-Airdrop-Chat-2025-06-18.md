## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify any important information related to Levana or other significant announcements. 

Looking at the earliest messages, there's a lot of off-topic stuff like jokes, YouTube links, and personal comments. But Bogdan_T38's message at 22:46:58 asks specifically about Levana, so that's the main question here. The other messages don't seem to mention Levana directly except maybe for the ones discussing crypto projects like Leap Fest and some token details.

Then there's higaurav12's message at 22:22:04 announcing Leap Fest with $10K+ rewards and multi-VM support across various blockchains. That's a key point because it's a project update. The rest of the messages are mostly unrelated: memes, personal jabs, moderation actions (like users being muted or banned), and some crypto price discussions. 

Some messages mention a user named AJ crypto456 being reported or muted, and comments about scams or polls. But these don't relate to Levana. The summary should focus on Levana's status and the Leap Fest announcement. Other things like the Zinsen (interest rates) from the ECB on June 5th, 2025, lowering to 2.15% effective June 11th, might be relevant if Levana is connected to ECB policies, but the text doesn't indicate that. 

I should check if any other messages mention Levana. The ones from iconoicono about minting a token if someone held a snapshot might be related if Levana is a token, but without explicit mention, it's unclear. The user's question is about Levana, so unless other messages reference Levana, they shouldn't be included. 

So the key points are:
1. Bogdan_T38 asks about Levana's status.
2. higaurav12 announces Leap Fest with rewards and multi-VM support.

The rest are either off-topic, unrelated, or don't mention Levana. The summary should state that Levana's status isn't detailed here, but there's an announcement about Leap. Also, note the moderation actions if they affect Levana-related users, but since they don't, maybe omit them.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring or significant themes.

Starting with Bogdan_T38's question about Levana. Levana might be a project, person, or token, so that's a topic. Then there's iconoicono sharing a link to "Doomposting" on Telegram. Doomposting could be a channel or a concept, so that's another point.

Next, higaurav12 announces Leap Fest with $10K+ rewards and mentions multi-VM support across several blockchains like Bitcoin, EVM, Solana, etc. So "Leap Fest" and "multi-VM support" are topics. The mention of specific blockchains might be worth noting, but maybe they're part of the multi-VM topic.

There are several YouTube links shared by iconoicono. The videos might relate to topics, but unless specified, maybe the act of sharing videos is a topic. However, some messages mention specific terms like "The CEWT Cult Cabal" or "Atom Community Fund," which could be separate topics. 

Other messages include discussions about cryptocurrency prices (e.g., "3$ ,6$", "Yes but this Is fake", "Master you suck at chess"), which points to "Cryptocurrency price speculation." There's also mention of staking profits related to Luna, so "Staking profits" might be a topic.

Social commentary and humor come up, like "Retardocracy," "Transcommunist," and jokes about nationalities or groups. The user also talks about social life ("real friends in real life"), which could be a topic. 

MissRose_bot mutes or bans users, so "Telegram moderation" or "User bans/mutes" might be relevant. There's a mention of the European Central Bank lowering interest rates, so "ECB interest rate cut" is another topic.

Some messages refer to specific individuals like Jerome Powell, Trump, and Ajcrypto456, but unless they're central themes, maybe they're part of broader topics like "Political figures" or "Scammers." The text also includes references to scams ("scammer," "scammy wick"), so "Scams" is a topic.

Other topics could be "Blockchain technology" due to mentions of multi-VM and various chains, "

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The user provided a list of chat messages with timestamps and usernames. Some messages are in different languages, like German, and there are a few emojis and links. I should be careful with those.

Starting with the first message: "Bogdan_T38 at 2025-06-18T22:46:58+00:00: What is happening with Levana?" That's a question asking for information. It doesn't seem positive or negative, just neutral. The user is probably seeking an update on Levana, which might be a project or a person. 

Next, "iconoicono at 2025-06-18T22:26:40+00:00: [DOOMPOSTING link]" The word "doomposting" usually refers to spreading negative or pessimistic news. The link is to a Telegram channel, but the message itself is just sharing a link with that label. The sentiment here is likely negative because of "doomposting."

Then, "iconoicono at 2025-06-18T22:23:10+00:00: nice leap out" The phrase "nice leap out" could be positive. "Nice" is a positive adjective, so this might be a positive message, maybe congratulating someone on a leap or a move.

"Higaurav12's message about Leap Fest with $10K+ rewards and multi-VM support across various blockchains. Words like "nice," "üéâ," and "thanks for your attention üôå" indicate excitement and positivity. This is definitely a positive message promoting an event and new features.

The next messages from iconoicono include links to YouTube videos and some comments like "you are luck he is not owning a cock" which seems sarcastic or humorous but might lean negative. However, the user might be making a joke, so maybe neutral. But the mention of someone not owning a cock could be derogatory, so possibly negative.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify any that indicate a task, decision, or required action.

Starting with the latest message from higaurav12 at 22:22:04. They mention "Leap Fest" with $10K+ rewards and multi-VM support across several blockchains. The part about announcing an event with rewards and technical updates sounds like a decision or next step. Maybe the action item here is promoting Leap Fest or implementing the multi-VM support.

Then there's a message from iconoicono at 20:09:44 saying you might mint one for free if you held during the snapshot. That's a possible action item for users to mint tokens.

Another one from user_648634375 at 13:50:58 asking "When namada trading?" which is a question but not an action item. However, if there's an answer or a plan mentioned, that could be a next step. But in the given text, there's no response provided, so maybe not.

Looking at keyleu's message at 12:44:02: "Back to 50%. Share it with your family and friends plz." The "share" part is a direct action item, urging others to share the information.

Matte_D's messages around 12:58 discuss token circulation and FDV. Not sure if those are action items unless there's a decision to address the FDV concerns, but the text doesn't show a resolution.

MissRose_bot has several entries about muting or banning users. Those are administrative actions, so decisions made by moderators to mute or ban users for specific reasons.

Iconoicono's message at 19:43:55 includes a YouTube video link. Sharing a link might be an action item if it's meant to inform others, but unless there's a specific instruction to watch or do something, maybe not. Similarly for other links.

Other messages are mostly jokes, opinions, or general discussions without clear actions. For example, "Pls deport Trump to Russia" is a suggestion but not a documented decision or next step.

So compiling all these, the main action items and decisions would be:
