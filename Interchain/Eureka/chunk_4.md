## Chunk 4

**Original Text:**

Application Developers - ensuring your end users have access to Eureka assets and bridging capabilities via the Skip Go API. ​
Chain Developers
If you’re developing a Cosmos-based blockchain, the easiest way to unlock Eureka assets and bridging capabilities is by opening up an IBC connection to the Cosmos Hub:

Requires an IBC (classic) connection to the Cosmos Hub
No chain upgrade is needed if you’re already using IBC
Users benefit from reduced cost of asset transfers between Eureka-enabled domains through batching
Chains only need to maintain a single relayer to the Cosmos Hub to reach the entire Eureka and IBC network
If you are interested in a direct Eureka connection to Ethereum or L2s/Solana coming later this year, please reach out to Jeremy or Susannah directly as additional integration work is required. ​
Asset Issuers
During the initial rollout of IBC Eureka, we will be working closely with asset issuers to ensure their tokens are bridged over and set up in the Skip Go API for application developers to support easily. If you’re an asset issuer looking to expand access to your token across different blockchains connected to the Eureka ecosystem, please reach out to Jeremy or Susannah so that we can help set you up! ​
Application Developers
If you’re an application developer looking to give your users access to Eureka assets in your UI or to leverage them within your protocol, integrating into the Eureka ecosystem via Skip Go is super simple!

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're providing guidance for Chain Developers and Application Developers on how to integrate with the Cosmos Hub's Eureka and IBC network through the Skip Go API. Here are the main points:

**Chain Developers:**

* To unlock Eureka assets and bridging capabilities, open an IBC connection to the Cosmos Hub.
* No chain upgrade is needed if you're already using IBC.
* Reduced cost of asset transfers between Eureka-enabled domains through batching.

**Asset Issuers:**

* Collaborate with Chain Developers to bridge tokens from your domain to the Skip Go API for easy access.
* Set up bridging over and configuration for application developers to support IBC connections.

**Application Developers:**

* Integrate into the Eureka ecosystem via the Skip Go API for UI or protocol-based use cases.
