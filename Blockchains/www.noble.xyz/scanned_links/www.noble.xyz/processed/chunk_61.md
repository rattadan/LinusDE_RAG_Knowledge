### Document Overview  
Noble is raising $15 million in Series A funding, introducing EURe (Euro-backed stablecoin) and CCTP (Cosmos-compatible USDC bridge), and emphasizing native USDC integration with Celestia Rollups.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Series A Funding**: Initial-stage fundraising to scale ecosystem features.  
- **Euro-backed Stablecoin (EURe)**: First Euro-backed stablecoin in the IBC-enabled Cosmos ecosystem.  
- **CCTP (Cosmos Token Bridge Protocol)**: Enables seamless USDC bridging between Cosmos and Ethereum, improving liquidity and UX.  
- **Native USDC**: USDC issued directly on the Noble blockchain, distinct from bridged forms.  
- **Celestia Rollups**: Layer-2 solutions for Cosmos, enabling efficient USDC issuance and transactions.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Funding**: $15 million Series A led by Paradigm.  
- **EURe**: Euro-backed stablecoin with IBC (Inter-Blockchain Connectivity) compatibility, enabling cross-chain transactions.  
- **CCTP**: Bridges USDC from Cosmos to Ethereum, allowing users to access native USDC on Celestia Rollups.  
- **Native USDC**: USDC issued directly on Noble blockchain, avoiding intermediaries, and optimized for Cosmos ecosystem interoperability.  
- **Celestia Rollups**: Plans to deploy native USDC on Celestia, enhancing scalability and user experience.  

### Related Topics  
- **Cosmos Ecosystem**: EURe and CCTP are part of the Cosmos networkâ€™s interoperability efforts.  
- **USDC Bridge Protocols**: CCTP addresses gaps in bridging USDC between blockchains.  
- **Native vs. Bridged USDC**: Native USDC on Noble differs from bridged forms (e.g., Cosmos-bridge USDC) in terms of governance, liquidity, and decentralization.
