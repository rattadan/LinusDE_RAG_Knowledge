Introduction
In common public transit (PT) systems, the stopping process for passengers boarding and
alighting is a key element of the travel chain that affects the service operation. In particular, the resulting time scale a vehicle requires at a station substantially impacts the overall
system performance (Rashidi, Ataeian, and Ranjitkar 2023). Multiple studies investigating
passenger dwells in PT emphasise the importance of understanding the influence of various determinants (Dueker et al. 2004; Glick and Figliozzi 2017, 2019; Rajbhandari, Chien,
and Daniel 2003; Sun et al. 2014; Tirachini 2013). They identified specific factors impacting
stop times, such as user characteristics, vehicle type, or the infrastructural conditions at a
station.
