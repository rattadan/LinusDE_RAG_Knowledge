h3: Tell us a little about the app you are building on Base?

h3: "Byte is the world's first autonomous AI agent that can deliver food right to your doorstep. Byte provides the world's best food ordering experience through the power of AI and crypto. We believe that human language is the new UX. Any online surface where there are users interacting in human language, they can connect to Byte to order the perfect meal with a 0-click, agentic checkout experience. The future of food ordering is based."

h3: "Be active, engage in the community, and build something. You never know where the opportunities will come from."

h3: What's the best part of building on Base?

h3: "The best part about building on Base is the great developer ecosystem. There are so many great developer tools built by Coinbase Developer Platform that make it easy to get started building and get support in your builder journey. There are also plenty of other great products being built on Base which we can benefit from and easily connect with. I think the EVM compatibility, fast transactions, and low transaction costs attract the developer community who then build amazing products that we can use."

h3: What do you want to tell builders who are thinking about Base? Why would you convince them to join Base?

h3: "I would join Base because of the innovation happening. Every day I learn about another great developer product that I want to dive deep on and learn more about how I can use it to help build my product. The community is also super inviting and helpful. I get approached a lot by builders who see what I'm working on and help point me to tools and solutions that can help me. This is especially helpful because when there are so many great products, it is much easier to speak with developers who have built them or worked with them so I can ramp up quickly and start building."
