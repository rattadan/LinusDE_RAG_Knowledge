## Chunk 29

**Original Text:**

Instead, user costs are approximated as
follows:
• The DRT trip travel time is calculated based on the beeline distance and an average beeline speed which is obtained from the detailed DRT simulation. The average beeline speed is updated every k iterations and considers
the time passengers spend inside the DRT vehicles as well as the time passengers spend waiting for a DRT
vehicle. • The DRT trip fare is computed in the same way as in the detailed simulation. For the distance-related fare,
the DRT trip distance is calculated based on the beeline distance and an average beeline distance factor which
is obtained from the detailed DRT simulation. The average beeline distance is updated every k iterations and
considers the network layout and actual distance driven by DRT vehicles.

Here's a reformatted version of the text with added spaces for readability:

Instead, user costs are approximated as follows:

• The Distance Run Time (DRT) trip travel time is calculated based on the beeline distance and an average beeline speed which is obtained from the detailed DRT simulation. The average beeline speed is updated every k iterations and considers
the time passengers spend inside the DRT vehicles as well as the time passengers spend waiting for a DRT vehicle.
