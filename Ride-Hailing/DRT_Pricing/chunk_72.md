## Chunk 72

**Original Text:**

In addition,
the pricing scheme should have a relatively high minimum fee in order to make the DRT mode less attractive for shortdistance travelers who may as well walk or take the bicycle without facing any high additional costs. The simulation
experiments have also shown that even for a city-wide DRT service area and a minimum fee of 3.00 EUR, without
car tolling only 11% of the DRT users are shifted from the car mode. With car tolling, the simulation experiments
yield a larger share of users switching from car to DRT. Similar to the finding in [see, e.g., 9], this highlights the
importance to combine ’pull’ measures (introducing DRT as a new mode of transportation) with ’push’ measures,
such as, implementing a road pricing scheme, increasing parking costs or banning private vehicles in certain areas. In
several simulation experiments, even for a city-wide DRT and a minimum fee, a significant share of DRT users come
from the PT mode.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you're discussing the Dynamic Road Traffic (DRT) system, which is designed to reduce congestion and traffic volume on roads by encouraging passengers to use public transportation or ride-sharing services instead. You've outlined several key points related to pricing schemes for DRT:

1. **High minimum fee**: Implementing a high minimum fee can deter short-distance travelers from using DRT, making it less attractive compared to walking or biking with no additional costs.
2. **Effect of car tolling without pricing scheme**: Without an effective road pricing scheme, only 11% of users in a city-wide DRT service area are shifted from the car mode to public transportation only when car tolls are introduced.
3. **Impact of introducing DRT as a new mode (car tolling) and increasing parking costs or banning private vehicles**: Combining "pull" measures (introducing DRT as a new option) with "push" measures, such as implementing car tolling, can significantly increase the share of users switching from car to public transportation.

It's also worth noting that you've highlighted the importance of considering the following factors:

* The effectiveness of pricing schemes in deterring short-distance travelers.
* The potential benefits of combining different types of traffic mitigation measures (e.g., DRT, car tolling).
* The need to study simulation experiments that take into account various factors affecting user behavior.
