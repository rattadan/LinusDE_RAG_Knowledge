## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message to identify the main topics.

Starting from the top, BasementNodes mentions swapping in pools, but that's a minor point. Then there's a discussion about building a game called "Ashes" but it's just for memorial and bragging rights. Osmosis_statbot and combot are about support and message stats, which might not be crucial. 

Svansy's messages are critical. He's complaining that the DEX is broken, with issues like missing tokens (W, Pyth), routing problems leading to losses, and unreliable APRs. He mentions needing hard refreshes to find pools and that even pools with significant liquidity get lost. This points to frontend and routing system issues. 

BasementNodes and Svansy discuss a token called "W" being broken, and Czarcas7ic notes no W liquidity left. There's also mention of a proposal to grant Frizzante Finance contract deployment rights, which is a governance decision. Another proposal about IBC rate limits is reviewed, adjusting limits for certain tokens. 

Razzienww talks about expanding the Furnace platform to burn tokens, adding more Osmosis-native coins, and making it permissionless. There's some job-related discussion between jasbanza and ctrlfelix, but it seems like a dead end. 

Key points: DEX usability issues, broken pools and tokens, routing problems causing losses, unreliable APRs, governance proposals (Frizzante contract deployment, IBC rate limits), Furnace token burns, and job inquiries. 

Decisions made: The Furnace expansion to include more tokens and permissionless setup. The IBC rate limit adjustments. The Frizzante proposal for contract deployment. 

I need to structure the summary around these elements, keeping it concise. Highlight the main problems users are facing, the governance actions, and the Furnace updates. Avoid the less relevant parts like job links that didn't pan out. Make sure to note the user frustration and the specific technical issues mentioned.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or topics being discussed.

Starting with the earliest messages, I see some job-related links and discussions. For example, ctrlfelix and jasbanza are exchanging messages about job postings and broken links. That's one topic: job opportunities or backend engineering positions.

Then there's a lot of conversation around a project called "Furnace" by razzienww. They mention adding tokens to the furnace, burning tokens, and making it permissionless. So topics here include token burning, Furnace project, and permissionless deployment.

Looking at BasementNodes and Svansy's messages, they're talking about issues with the Osmosis DEX. Svansy complains about broken pools, errors, APRs being unreliable, and problems with the router. BasementNodes mentions removing APR numbers from the frontend. So main topics here are Osmosis DEX issues, pool errors, APR inaccuracies, and routing problems.

Another recurring point is the mention of specific tokens like W, Pyth, Amber, and others. There's a question about the W pool and missing tokens on Osmosis. So token-specific issues on Osmosis might be a topic.

There's also a proposal mentioned by osmogovbot about deploying CosmWasm contracts without governance approval, related to Frizzante Finance. That's a governance proposal topic. Similarly, another proposal about IBC rate limits is discussed, so IBC rate limits could be another topic.

Svansy uses phrases like "memory for your lost life savings" and "Max Shame Coin," which might relate to a meme or a token with humorous or satirical intent. The mention of "Game of Ashes" and "memorial and bragging rights" by razzienww also points towards a game or project with a similar theme.

Additionally, there's a support link provided by osmosis_statbot, indicating customer support or official support site as a topic.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be:

- Osmosis DEX issues
- Token burning (Furnace project)
- APR inaccuracies
- Pool errors
- Routing problems
- Governance proposals (Frizzante Finance, IBC rate limits)
- Missing tokens (e

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify relevant parts.

Starting with the latest messages. BasementNodes at 23:52 says they swap in the pools. Not sure if that's an action item or just a statement. Maybe not an action item here. 

Then razzienww at 23:06 mentions building a game called "the game of ashes" but for now, only memorial and bragging rights. That seems like a project idea, but is there a decision or next step? Maybe not yet. 

Looking at osmosis_statbot at 23:01, they provided a support link. The action item here could be directing users to visit the support site for help. 

combot and bakdalnamu at 22:56 mention total messages. Probably not relevant. 

Svansy's messages from 22:51 to 22:56 talk about the DEX being broken, errors, issues with APRs, routing problems. They ask if devs can do something. So here, the action items would be reporting the issues to the maintenance team or devs. Also, checking what's wrong with the DEX. 

BasementNodes at 22:48 and 22:45 criticize APRs and mention a shitcoin, but maybe not action items. 

Czarcas7ic at 22:20 says there's no W liquidity on Osmosis, which might be a decision or a next step if someone needs to address liquidity. 

Svansy's earlier messages from 21:53 onwards talk about broken pools, missing tokens, APR inaccuracies, and suggest the DEX is broken. So again, pointing to needing devs to fix these issues. 

razzienww's messages from 21:16 mention adding new tokens to the Furnance, and later at 17:29 and 16:51 discuss burning tokens and making Furnance permissionless. The action items here could be adding new tokens to Furnance and the plan to make it permissionless. 

The osmogovbot message about Frizzante Finance's proposal to deploy contracts without governance approval is a decision point, but the proposal
