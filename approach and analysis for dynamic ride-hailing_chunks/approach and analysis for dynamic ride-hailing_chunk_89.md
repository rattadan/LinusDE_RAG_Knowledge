**Original Text:**

Only the 50% error
has a significant impact on the service rate, with reductions ranging
from 2‚Äì7%. We identified the huge differences in demand in different
areas as the reason for this insensibility. The demand in hotspot areas
is approximately 5 times higher than the demand in ‚Äò‚Äònormal‚Äô‚Äô areas
of the same size. Therefore, even with a demand estimation error of
50%, the repositioning strategies will still send vehicles to high-demand
areas, only the ratio slightly changes. Consequently, a very precise
demand estimation is not necessary when the differences between zones
in terms of demand are very high. Increasing the interval will reduce the repositioning costs but also the
service quality. In order to quantify this relationship, we also tested
ùõøùëÖ ‚àà {30 min, 60 min}. The proposed undersupply probability strategy
saves roughly 25% of repositioning costs when performing repositioning only every 60 min instead of every 15 min.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details and parameters related to dynamic dispatch strategies in ride-hailing systems, specifically how they can be optimized to minimize repositioning costs while maintaining service quality.

The exact technical details described in this chunk include:

1. The relationship between demand estimation error and the impact on service rate (2-7% decrease)
2. The identification of hotspot areas with significantly higher demand than "normal" zones
3. The development of an undersupply probability strategy to reduce repositioning costs without sacrificing service quality

This section connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing a theoretical basis for understanding how dynamic dispatch can be optimized in ride-hailing systems
2. Establishing the importance of demand estimation error and its impact on service rate
3. Introducing the concept of undersupply probability strategy, which is likely used as a technique to balance between repositioning costs and service quality

The specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk include:

1. The need for precise demand estimation to minimize repositioning costs
2. The importance of identifying hotspot areas with significantly higher demand than "normal" zones
3. The trade-off between reducing repositioning costs (through undersupply probability strategy) and maintaining service quality

Overall, this section provides a technical explanation of how dynamic dispatch strategies can be optimized in ride-hailing systems to improve efficiency while ensuring high-quality services, which is relevant to the broader topic of ride-hailing management and simulation.
