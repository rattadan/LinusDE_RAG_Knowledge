break above their MAs, itâs more likely that traders are bullish.
- Relative strength index (RSI):The RSI is a line graph below a cryptoâs central price chart indicating how fast traders bought or sold a crypto within a set time frame. As the RSI rises closer to 100, thereâs a good chance people overbought the cryptocurrency, and now itâs due for a price fall as traders take profits. Conversely, RSI scores closer to 0 signify there are virtually no buyers for a cryptocurrency, meaning it may be a good value.
- Fibonacci ratios:Named after Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, Fibonacci ratios are percentages that perfectly measure many aspects of the natural world (e.g., the center of hurricanes, sunflowers, and Nautilus seashells). Interestingly, traders often use Fibonacci levels to predict where a virtual currencyâs price will likely fall or rise, identifying its support and resistance levels. The Fibonacci ratios go as follows: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%.
