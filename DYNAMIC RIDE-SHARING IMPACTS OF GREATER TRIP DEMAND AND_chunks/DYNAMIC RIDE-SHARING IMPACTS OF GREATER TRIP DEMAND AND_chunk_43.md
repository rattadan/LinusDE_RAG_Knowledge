## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 43

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

System VMT savings purely from
using PUDO zones are less than 4%, which undermines the benefits of an increased AVO
marginally. Larger mode shares of SAVs, and perhaps operating more freely, in a large network
may enjoy greater benefits but this effect was purposefully isolated to focus on PUDO zones. A
non-uniform enforcement of stops both spatially and temporally is expected to help the system as
a whole (attractive mode for users, as well as congestion relief). The recommended stop spacing
of a quarter mile closely resembled that used presently by transit planners, but PUDOs are able
to be placed more flexibly outside of specific corridors to improve access area compared to a
typical transit routeâ€™s catchment area. Four additional mode share-focused scenarios revealed the
potential for SAV fleets and stops in improving regional travel thanks to demand for SAVs being
more evenly spread out.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk describes the technical details related to system VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) savings, specifically focusing on PUDO zones. Here's a detailed analysis of what this chunk is explaining:

1. **Technical details:** The context mentions "PUDO zones" and their impact on system VMT savings. However, no specific technical parameters or processes are described in this chunk.
2. **Contextual connection:** This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by discussing the benefits of a Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) fleet in reducing congestion pricing and optimizing ridesplitting services. The text implies that PUDO zones may be part of an overall solution to address these challenges, although it does not explicitly state this.
3. **Requirements and constraints:** There are no specific requirements or constraints mentioned in this chunk.

In terms of what this section is explaining:

* The benefits of a Shared Autonomous Vehicle fleet on system VMT savings
* The potential impact of PUDO zones on reducing congestion pricing and optimizing ridesplitting services
* The expected outcomes of non-uniform enforcement of stops, including attracting more users and providing congestion relief

This analysis highlights that the text chunk is describing the technical aspects related to SAVs and their interactions with PUDO zones in a way that builds upon the surrounding context. However, it does not explicitly state how these factors will impact system VMT savings or any specific benefits associated with using SAVs in congested areas.
