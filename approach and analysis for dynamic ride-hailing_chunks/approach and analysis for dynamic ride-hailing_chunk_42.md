I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

For these settings, the strategy can be adapted by not
only considering rejected requests but also requests that were served
with a significantly higher waiting time because this would indicate an
undersupply as well. The main disadvantage of this strategy is that it is
purely reactive and not proactive. Since no explicit demand estimation
is integrated, an imbalance in the fleet distribution has to happen and
has to be noticeable in the results before the strategy can react to it and
try to prevent it in the future. Iterative zone balance. The iterative zone balance strategy, introduced by Fagnant and Kockelman (2014), overcomes this issue by
utilizing a short-term demand estimation for different parts (‘‘zones’’)
of the service area. Here, for each zone 𝑘 ∈ , a balance value 𝑏𝑘 is
calculated by taking the difference between the relative supply and the
relative demand:
supply𝑘
demand𝑘
−∑

𝑏𝑘 = ∑
supply
𝑘∈
𝑘∈ demand

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the specific section:

The exact technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk are:

* A balance value (`b_k`) is calculated by taking the difference between the relative supply and the relative demand for each zone (`𝑘`).
* The calculation is performed using a formula involving the sum of supply and demand across all zones (`∑`), as well as individual terms for each zone.

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context through:

* The mention of "demand forecasting" in the main text, which suggests that dynamic dispatch strategies are being discussed.
* The references provided at the end of the section, which demonstrate a range of methodologies used for demand forecasting in ride-hailing systems.

Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned include:

* A need to handle undersupply situations, where requests have been rejected but also requests with significantly higher waiting times were served. This implies that the strategy should be able to adapt and respond proactively to changes in demand.
* The requirement for a reactive approach, meaning that the strategy cannot react until it has detected an imbalance in fleet distribution.

This chunk is explaining how the iterative zone balance strategy can be used to address undersupply issues by using short-term demand estimation.
