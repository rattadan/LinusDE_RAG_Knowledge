## Chunk 8

**Original Text:**

The messaging protocol is built on top of the NKN network, leveraging its unique features to provide a decentralized, scalable, and robust messaging infrastructure. By defining a sequence of messages to be exchanged
between riders and drivers, the messaging protocol enables efficient and reliable ride negotiation while ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information. In this section, we will discuss the technical details
of the messaging protocol, including its encryption and security features, reliability and fault tolerance, and
integration with the NKN network. 2.1. Network
The implementation of peer-to-peer protocols in mobile applications can be challenging, especially due to
the dynamic nature of mobile devicesâ€™ network conditions, which often do not have a static public IP address.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems there's a slight discrepancy between what you've provided and the response I'm expected to give.

To answer your question correctly, here's a revised response:

The messaging protocol is indeed built on top of the NKN (Neighborless Knowledge Network) network, leveraging its unique features such as decentralization, scalability, and robustness. By defining a sequence of messages to be exchanged between riders and drivers, the messaging protocol enables efficient and reliable ride negotiation while ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information.

This section will discuss the technical details of the messaging protocol, including its encryption and security features, reliability and fault tolerance, and integration with the NKN network. Specifically, we'll explore how the protocol handles dynamic mobile device network conditions, such as changing IP addresses or network connectivity.
