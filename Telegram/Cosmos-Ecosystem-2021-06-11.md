## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of tweets and messages from different users related to the Cosmos Ecosystem and Sputnik Navigation System.

First, I'll go through each entry one by one. The first tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem is about learning more about Terraform Labs. The date is June 11, 2021, but the key point here is the mention of Terraform Labs. Maybe that's important for context.

Next, another tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem announces a video contest called "Discover Cosmos" with a prize pool of 5000 $ATOM. That's a key point because it's an event with a reward, which could be a decision point for the community to participate.

Then, there's a tweet about Sputnik adding programming to their Navigation System, allowing users to choose which token prices are shown. The permalink is provided, but the main takeaway here is the new feature for customization.

Looking at the SputnikNetwork message, they list three tokens: cosmos, terra-luna, persistence. Not sure if that's part of the feature or a separate point, but maybe these are examples of tokens that can be selected.

The unknown user's message explains the steps for admins to program the Sputnik bot. The steps are adding the bot to the chat, starting it, using the /projects command, selecting tokens, and then users can get prices from Coingecko. This seems like a detailed process that's a key decision point for admins to set up the bot.

Another unknown message shares a link to a Kava Labs tweet, but without context, maybe it's not crucial unless the link itself is important. However, the user might want just the key points from the text provided, so maybe the link is just a reference and can be omitted unless necessary.

Raul_SRE mentions BitCanna in action, which might be an exclamation about their involvement or a project they're working on, but without more info, it's a bit unclear. However, since it's part of the text, I should note it as a mention of BitCanna's activity.

Putting it all together, the main points are the video contest with $ATOM prizes, the Sputnik Navigation System update allowing token price customization via a bot, the steps for admins to set that up, and the

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to read through all the tweets and messages to identify recurring themes or subjects.

Starting with the first tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem about Terraform Labs. That seems to be introducing or discussing Terraform Labs, so "Terraform Labs" is a main topic here.

Next, another tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem mentions a Video Contest with a prize pool of $ATOM. The contest is part of the "Discover Cosmos" initiative. So "Video Contest" and "Discover Cosmos" are topics. Also, the prize involves $ATOM, which is the Cosmos token, so maybe "Cosmos Ecosystem" is a broader category here.

The third tweet talks about Sputnik adding programming for the Sputnik Navigation System, allowing token price displays. Here, the key topics are "Sputnik Navigation System" and "token prices". The mention of programming might tie into the system's functionality.

Then there's a line from SputnikNetwork listing tokens: cosmos, terra-luna, persistence. These are specific blockchain projects, so each should be a separate topic. "Cosmos", "Terra-Luna", "Persistence".

Another unknown user's message explains how admins can program the Sputnik Navigation System to filter tokens. Steps include adding the bot, starting it, using /projects, and specifying tokens. This reinforces "Sputnik Navigation System" and also mentions "Coingecko" integration for price data. The bot itself, "SputnikPriceBot", is a topic.

A link to a Kava Labs tweet is included, but the text isn't visible. Since the URL is there, maybe "Kava Labs" is a topic, but without the content, it's uncertain. However, the user might expect it to be listed as a reference.

Lastly, Raul_SRE mentions BitCanna in action. BitCanna is another blockchain project, so "BitCanna" should be a topic.

Putting it all together, the main topics are the various blockchain projects and initiatives mentioned: Terraform Labs, Cosmos Ecosystem, Video Contest, Sputnik Navigation System, token prices, Cosmos, Terra-Luna, Persistence, SputnikPriceBot, Coingecko, Kava Labs, BitCanna. Also, the prize pool in $ATOM and the programming aspect of the Sputnik

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. So, the user provided several tweets and messages from different accounts related to the Cosmos Ecosystem and some other crypto projects. The task is to analyze the overall sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, looking at the tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first one mentions learning more about Terraform Labs. Terraform Labs is a company involved in blockchain, specifically Terra Luna, which I know had a significant crash later. But the tweet itself is just informative, so maybe neutral? But since it's promoting learning about a project, maybe positive? Hmm.

Next, the Video Contest with a prize pool of 5000 $ATOM. Contests usually encourage participation and can be seen as positive because they offer rewards. So that's probably positive.

Then, Sputnik added programming for their Navigation System, allowing users to choose which token prices to show. This seems like a feature update, which is a positive development for users. So positive here.

The SputnikNetwork message lists some tokens: cosmos, terra-luna, persistence. Just listing tokens, neutral on its own.

Unknown user starts the bot, which is a neutral action. Then another unknown user explains how admins can program the bot to show specific tokens. This is instructional and informative, so neutral. The steps are practical, no clear positive or negative language.

Another unknown user shares a link to a Kava Labs tweet. Without seeing the content of that tweet, it's hard to judge, but since it's just a link, maybe neutral.

Raul_SRE's message: "BitCanna in action !!!!!!!!!!". BitCanna is another crypto project. The use of multiple exclamation points suggests enthusiasm, so positive sentiment here.

Putting it all together: There are a few positive elements (contest, feature update, enthusiastic message about BitCanna). The rest are neutral informational updates. No negative language present. So overall sentiment is positive.
</think>

The sentiment of the provided text is **positive**.  

### Key Observations:  
1. **Promotional and Encouraging Content**:  
   - The Cosmos Ecosystem tweets highlight a video contest with a prize pool of $5000 ATOM, which incentivizes engagement and community participation.  
   - The Sputnik Navigation System update allows customization of token prices, framed as a user-friendly improvement.  

2. **Enthusiastic

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text includes several tweets and some bot interactions.

First, I'll go through each entry one by one. The first tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem is about learning more about Terraform Labs. Not sure if there's an action item here, maybe just a topic of interest.

Next, the video contest with a prize pool of $5000 ATOM. That's an event or opportunity, but unless there's a call to action like "submit your video by X date," maybe not an action item. Wait, the tweet itself is announcing the contest, so the action would be participating in it.

Then, Sputnik adding programming for their Navigation System. The subsequent messages detail steps for admins to set up the bot. There's a numbered list here: adding the bot, starting it, sending commands, etc. Those are clear action items for admins.

Another part is the unknown user at 18:44:56 sending "/start@SputnikPriceBot". That's a next step for users to initiate the bot.

The unknown message at 14:35:00 is a link to a Kava Labs tweet. Not sure if there's an action here unless it's referencing another action, but without the content of that link, maybe not. The user might just be sharing the link.

Raul_SRE's message about BitCanna in action seems like a general announcement, not an action item.

So, the main action items are the steps outlined for admins to program the Sputnik bot. Also, the start command for users. The video contest is a decision to offer prizes, but unless there's a deadline or submission step mentioned, maybe not. The user might need to know about the contest as an opportunity.

Wait, the user instructions mention that the bot will respond only to admins. So the steps 1-5 are all admin actions. Each step is a next action they need to take. So I should list those as action items. Also, the initial start command by any user to activate the bot.

I need to structure them clearly, maybe under different categories like Admin Actions and User Actions. Also, the video contest prize pool is a decision made by Cosmos Ecosystem. The BitCanna mention might not have an action item unless it's part of a larger
