Putting tweets into bigger context of intentions:
The author appears to be a capitalist-minded Nigerian professional with religious beliefs who is frustrated with the inefficiencies of the public sector. They're looking to build a blockchain project on TON (Telegram Open Network), as evidenced by the job posting. Their criticism of civil service and advocacy for entrepreneurs suggests they may be trying to motivate change in Nigeria's economic approach. The tweet about God could indicate they try to balance their strong market-oriented views with their personal faith. Their intention seems to be to promote private sector solutions while highlighting what they perceive as failures in public administration.

Now I'll generate 5 keywords/tags that represent the distinctive patterns in this content:
- Capitalism

These tags capture the main themes and context of the tweets.
