**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

Lending Interest – If the liquidity is deposited into a lending protocol, it accrues interest from borrowers. Incentives – Some protocols offer additional incentives, like governance token emissions or liquidity mining rewards. PoL APR is a community benefit rather than a direct voter incentive. Rather than distributing this yield to individual voters, it’s collected by Hydro to be redistributed to future Hydro bidders or back to the Cosmos Hub’s community pool. Future updates to Hydro may enable sharing of the PoL APR with Hydro voters. ### Example of PoL APR in Action
----------------------------

Let’s say Hydro deploys 10,000 ATOM to a lending protocol at an average yield of 8% APR. Over a year, this would generate 800 ATOM in revenue, which would be returned to Hydro to be redistributed to future Hydro bidders as additional liquidity or back to the Cosmos Hub’s community pool.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Current Text Chunk**

1. **Technical Details and Parameters:**
   - The text describes the process of lending interest and incentives in the context of Hydro's Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments.
   - It mentions that PoL APR is earned when liquidity is deposited into a lending protocol, and the yield is collected by Hydro.
   - A specific example of PoL APR is provided, where 10,000 ATOM is deployed at an 8% APR and generates 800 ATOM in revenue over a year.

2. **Connection to Surrounding Context:**
   - This chunk is connected to the larger context of Hydro's PoL deployments and its objective of managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity.
   - The text builds upon previous sections that discussed the Pilot Rounds, key components, and processes, by explaining the benefits of liquidity being deposited into lending protocols.

3. **Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**
   - There are no explicit technical requirements or constraints described in this chunk.
   - However, it does imply that a future update to Hydro may enable sharing of the PoL APR with Hydro voters, which could be considered a condition for future development.

In summary, this text chunk clarifies the mechanics of PoL APR and how it is handled within Hydro's system, specifically regarding revenue generation, and its redirection to support future Hydro bidders or the Cosmos Hub's community pool.
