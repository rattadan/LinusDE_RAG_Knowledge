## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 5 keywords or tags for better postprocessing based on the provided data. First, I need to understand the main themes from the given tweets.

Looking at the tweets, there are a lot about Ethereum's performance. Key points include:

1. Ethereum's active addresses and growth (like 15.4M active addresses and a 62.7% surge in 7 days).
2. Layer 2 dominance at 6.65x, which is a significant metric.
3. The Strategic Ethereum Reserve hitting a billion dollars, showing institutional backing.
4. Stablecoins reaching a new all-time high, indicating market strength.
5. Institutional investors like BlackRock moving towards Ethereum, showing real-world adoption.

So the main patterns are: Ethereum's growth metrics (active addresses, surge, layer 2 dominance), institutional adoption (Strategic Ethereum Reserve, BlackRock), and market strength (stablecoins, liquidity).

Now, the user wants keywords that capture these patterns. They need to be distinct and useful for postprocessing. Let me brainstorm:

- ETH GROWTH: Covers active addresses, surge, and layer 2 dominance.
- INSTITUTIONAL BACKING: Highlights the Strategic Ethereum Reserve and BlackRock's move.
- MARKET STRENGTH: Refers to stablecoins hitting new highs and liquidity.
- LAYER 2 DOMINANCE: Specific to the layer 2 metrics mentioned.
- ADOTION SIGNALS: Emphasizes the signals like new-address momentum and adoption cycles.

These tags should be concise and capture the essence of each theme. I need to make sure they are distinct and not overlapping too much. Let's check if they cover all the key points from the data. Yes, each tag addresses a different aspect: growth, institutional support, market strength, layer 2, and adoption signals. That should work.

**Keywords/Tags for Postprocessing:**  
1. **ETH_GROWTH** (Active addresses, surge, layer 2 dominance)  
2. **INSTITUTIONAL_BACKING** (Strategic Reserve, BlackRock's shift)  
3. **MARKET_STRENGTH** (Stablecoins, liquidity, institutional demand)  
4. **LAYER_2_DOMINANCE** (6.65x, scaling, network security)  
5. **ADOTION_SIGNALS** (New-address momentum, adoption cycles, market validation)
