## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 36

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

The costs for
each matching are usually the distance or the travel time between the
current location of the vehicle and the pickup location of the respective
request. Infeasible matchings can be prevented, e.g., by setting the
associated costs to a sufficiently high value, so that the optimal solution
will always contain as many feasible assignments as possible. The basic
version of the assignment problem can be formulated as follows:
∑
min
𝑐𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑖𝑗
(2)
(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝐼×𝐽

subject to

∑

𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1

∀𝑖 ∈ 𝐼

(3)

𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1

∀𝑗 ∈ 𝐽

(4)

∀𝑖 ∈ 𝐼, 𝑗 ∈ 𝐽

(5)

𝑗∈𝐽

∑

Although not used in our study, we want to point out the potential
benefit of allowing voluntary rejections. In our paper, as well as most
other articles in the literature, rejecting a customer is only allowed
when a feasible assignment is not possible in time. However, each
request has an individual explicit and implicit reward structure. Not
only are the distances to the requests as well as the serving distances
different, but also the destinations.
