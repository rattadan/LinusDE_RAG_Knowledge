# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_22.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://solana.com/*

### Document Overview  
The content covers technical aspects of Solana's blockchain, including consensus mechanisms, transaction validation, network protocols, and cryptographic concepts related to data entry, stake management, and program interactions.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
1. **Block Creation**: A block requiring supermajority stake votes to become confirmed.  
2. **Gossip Network**: A decentralized communication protocol connecting nodes in a cluster.  
3. **Epoch Deactivation**: Stake is temporarily deactivated after a certain period, progressing to withdrawal.  
4. **Program Calls**: Invoking instructions between on-chain programs.  
5. **Preimage-Resistant Hash**: A cryptographic identifier for entries, proving validity and timing.  
6. **Ledger Derivations**: Blocks derived from common entries but diverging in content.  
7. **Epoch Deactivation Timeline**: Stake becomes available for withdrawal after a specified number of epochs.  
8. **Transaction Fee Account**: The first account in a transaction pays for its inclusion, requiring read-write access.  
9. **Cross-Program Invocation**: Calling instructions between programs, with auxiliary data.  
10. **Configuration File**: Prepares the ledger for the genesis block.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Preimage-Resistant Hash**: The entry's identifier is a hash of its content, proving its validity and timing.  
- **Epoch Deactivation**: Stake is deactivated after a specified number of epochs, with the first account in a transaction needing read-write access.  
- **Gossip Network**: Nodes connect via a multicast network to validate entries and achieve consensus.  
- **Program Calls**: Invocations specify accounts to read/write and auxiliary data for instruction handlers.  
- **Configuration File**: A file (e.g., `config.json`) prepares the ledger for the genesis block.  

### Related Topics  
- **SecpoH (Proof of History)**: Related to the preimage-resistant hash and timeline verification.  
- **Cross-Program Invocation**: Connected to the described program calls.  
- **Configuration File**: Linked to the genesis block preparation mentioned in the text.

entryand creating aconfirmed block.

Ablockthat has received asuper majorityofledger votes.

A gossip network connecting allnodesof acluster.

Some number ofepochsafterstakehas been deactivated while
it progressively becomes available for withdrawal. During this period, the stake
is considered to be "deactivating". More info about:warmup and cooldown

A call from oneonchain programto another. For more
information, seecalling between programs.

A multicast network used to efficiently validateentriesand gain
consensus.

An offchain service that acts as a custodian for a user's private key. It
typically serves to validate and sign transactions.

An entry on theledgereither atickor atransaction's entry.

A preimage resistanthashover the final contents of an entry, which
acts as theentry'sglobally unique identifier. The hash serves as
evidence of:

Seeproof of history.

The time, i.e. number ofslots, for which aleader scheduleis valid.

The fee account in the transaction is the account that pays for the cost of
including the transaction in the ledger. This is the first account in the
transaction. This account must be declared as Read-Write (writable) in the
transaction since paying for the transaction reduces the account balance.

When nodes representing 2/3rd of thestakehave a commonroot.

Aledgerderived from common entries but then diverged.

The firstblockin the chain.

The configuration file that prepares theledgerfor thegenesis block.

A digital fingerprint of a sequence of bytes.

An increase in token supply over time used to fund rewards for validation and to
fund continued development of Solana.

Seecross-program invocation.

A call to invoke a specificinstruction handlerin aprogram. An instruction also specifies which accounts it wants to
read or modify, and additional data that serves as auxiliary input to theinstruction handler.
