## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 26

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

schemes, the number of DRT trips increases to a lesser extent, which is explained by the limited number of available
DRT vehicles (see in particular 3a). The DRT vehicle fleet size is set to a fixed number of 10,000 vehicles in all
simulation experiments. DRT vehicles operating at the capacity limit yields long waiting times for some DRT users
who will eventually prefer a different mode of transportation. Depending on the service area and pricing scheme, the
DRT trip share of all trips in the Berlin area ranges from 0.04% (DRT service area: inner-city Berlin area; Minimum
fare: 3.00 EUR) to 4.9% (DRT service area: entire Berlin area; Minimum fee: 0 EUR).

Analysis:

1. The technical details mentioned in this chunk are:
   - Vehicle capacity, which refers to the maximum number of passengers or vehicles that can be accommodated within a specific area.
   - Sharing level, which is the percentage of available seats or space that are being shared by multiple users.
   - Service area coverage, which includes the geographical extent of the transportation network being modeled.

2. The connection between this chunk and the surrounding context is:
   This chunk provides specific parameters and processes that will be used to model dynamic transport services in Berlin, including the integration of various transportation modes and the evaluation of key metrics such as passenger waiting times and travel speeds. It also outlines a method for optimizing the operation of shared autonomous vehicles using external cost pricing.

3. The requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk are:
   - A fixed number of DRT vehicles (10,000) will be used throughout all simulation experiments.
   - The DRT vehicle fleet size is limited by the capacity limit and available resources.
   - The trip share of all trips in the Berlin area varies depending on the service area and pricing scheme.

Specifically, this chunk appears to outline the technical parameters and processes necessary for simulating dynamic transport services in a specific context (Berlin), including:

- Modeling various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles)
- Evaluating key metrics such as passenger waiting times and travel speeds
- Optimizing the operation of shared autonomous vehicles using external cost pricing

To build upon this surrounding context, additional requirements or constraints might include:

- Defining clear boundaries for the service areas to be modeled
- Establishing clear criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of various transportation modes
- Identifying specific scenarios or use cases that will be tested with the model.
