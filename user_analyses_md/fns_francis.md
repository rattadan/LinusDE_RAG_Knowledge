Putting some tweets in bigger context of intentions:
The account is clearly advocating for XRP and Ripple as foundational technology for the next generation of financial infrastructure.

They are trying to position Ripple as the pioneer that other big tech companies are now following, suggesting that Ripple created the original blueprint that companies like Apple, Uber and Google are now adopting. The author wants to convince others that XRP's model is superior because it removes middlemen and creates a more frictionless system for transactions.
