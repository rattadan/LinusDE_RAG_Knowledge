## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 3

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Additionally, we show that, especially for low-utilized fleets, the simple
nearest-vehicle assignment strategy outperforms matching-based assignment approaches in many settings. The
insights gained are analyzed and thoroughly discussed. 1. Introduction

in order to reach good solutions since both parts heavily affect the
overall quality. For the repositioning part, we propose a new strategy based on the identified weaknesses in existing approaches from
the literature. Regarding the selection of an appropriate assignment
strategy, we realized that most of the papers in the literature that
study this kind of problem only consider one very specific setting for
which a solution method is presented (see Section 2). For example,
the fleet size is fixed, there is a specific maximum waiting time, only
idling vehicles are allowed to receive a new request assignment, and
a specific number of requests is temporally uniformly distributed over
the planning horizon.
