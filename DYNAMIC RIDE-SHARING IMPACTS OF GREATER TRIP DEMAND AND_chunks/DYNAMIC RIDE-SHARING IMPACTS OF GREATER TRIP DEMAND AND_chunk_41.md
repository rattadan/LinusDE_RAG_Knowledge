## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 41

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Average travel times were marginally higher than other scenarios. This is
because of the difference arising from average travel distances when comparing only between
SAV riders versus all travelers (who now use SAVs). Average walking time falls by half a
minute owing to stops being more accessible on average. AVO is also considerably high by 0.2
travelers per mi from this even distribution of trip origins and endings. The highlight of these
sets of scenarios is the large potential for lowering total VMT when using SAVs. Even without
DRS, total VMT dropped by 6% from travelers using SAVs as opposed to driving their personal
vehicles or being chauffeured by family. With DRS this VMT savings is much higher at 24%
and use of stops continue to improve savings by up to a total of 40% in savings. Table 3 Fleet Metrics and Network Impacts for a SAV-Reliant City

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the technical details of Average Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) per day for a Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) system, including:

1. **Technical parameters:**
	* Average travel times and distances between SAV riders versus all travelers.
	* Traveling time savings due to accessible stops on average.
	* Average walking time reduction.
2. **Processes or methods:**
	* Data comparison to determine the difference in average travel times.
	* Analysis of trip origins and endings distribution.
3. **Contextual connections:**
	* This chunk is located within a broader text discussing shared autonomous vehicles, their performance, and potential impacts on urban transportation systems.

This context connects the SAV-specific information to:

1. The overall discussion of shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance.
2. The comparison between SAV riders and all travelers to determine the VMT savings.
3. The relevance of DRS (Driverless Resource Sharing) in reducing VMT and improving travel times.

The specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned are:

* The need for a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports on shared autonomous vehicles.
* The timeframe spanning from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field.
