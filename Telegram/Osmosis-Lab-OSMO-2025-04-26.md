## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I need to parse through the text and identify the main issues and actions taken.

Starting from the earliest messages: kjonnnn asks for Osmosis testnet tokens. Then GPKwee requests an Osmo address. Then there's a problem reported by ngantran82 about depositing BNB from BNB chain, balance showing 0. GPKwee suggests using BNB.axl and later recommends Squid Router. ngantran82 mentions Squid is also erroring. GPKwee then reports an issue with Axelar, and ngantran82 concludes they have to wait for Axelar to fix it. Osmosis_statbot provides a support link.

Key points: BNB deposit issue on Osmosis, balance not displaying correctly, Axelar problem causing it, workaround with BNB.axl and Squid but both have errors, decision to wait for Axelar fix, and support link provided. Also, kjonnnn's request for testnet tokens is separate but part of the chat.

Need to make sure the summary captures the sequence of the problem, the attempted solutions, and the final decision to wait. Also mention the support site. Keep it brief, maybe a couple of sentences. Avoid timestamps and user handles, focus on what happened and the decisions made.
</think>

The chat discusses a technical issue where users are unable to deposit BNB tokens on Osmosis due to incorrect balance display (showing 0) despite holding funds. GPKwee suggests workarounds like using BNB.axl or Squid Router, but ngantran82 confirms Squid is also erroring. The group identifies the root cause as a problem with Axelar, leading to the decision to wait for Axelar's team to resolve it. Osmosis_statbot directs users to the official support site (https://support.osmosis.zone) for further assistance. Separately, kjonnnn requests Osmosis testnet tokens.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand the context of the conversation. Let me go through each message step by step.

Starting from the earliest messages, kjonnnn says, "i need osmosis testnet token." That seems like a request for testnet tokens, which is a common need in blockchain testing environments. Then GPKwee asks for an Osmo address, which is related to Osmosis, a blockchain platform. 

Next, ngantran82 reports an issue with depositing BNB from the BNB chain, stating the balance shows as 0. BNB is Binance Coin, so this is about a token transfer problem between chains. GPKwee suggests using BNB.axl and a link to Osmosis assets, indicating a possible solution through a specific token bridge. 

ngantran82 continues to mention that even though they have BNB, the balance isn't reflected, and they can't deposit. GPKwee then asks for a transaction ID (TX), which is standard when troubleshooting blockchain transactions. 

Later, ngantran82 points out that the deposit screen shows a zero balance, and another user mentions Squid router having an error. GPKwee provides a Squid router link for cross-chain transfers. Then, ngantran82 refers to Axelar, another blockchain bridge, and asks if they need to wait for a fix. GPKwee confirms there's a problem with Axelar, which is causing the issue.

Putting this together, the main topics are: Osmosis testnet tokens, BNB chain deposit issues, balance display errors, Axelar bridge problems, Squid router errors, cross-chain transfers, and transaction verification. Each of these is mentioned multiple times or is central to the problem being discussed. I should list them without repetition, ensuring they capture the key points. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other recurring issues or topics. The support site is mentioned, but that's more of a reference than a main topic. The focus is on the problems and solutions related to deposits, balances, and the bridges involved. Yeah, that should cover it.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. So, looking at the messages, they're all related to some technical issues with Osmosis and BNB balances. The user ngantran82 is reporting that their BNB balance isn't showing correctly and they can't deposit, even though they have the BNB. Other users like GPKwee are suggesting solutions, like using Squid or Axelar's BNB token, and asking for transaction details or addresses. There's also a mention of a support site by the bot.

Hmm, the main issue here seems to be frustration from ngantran82 because the system isn't working as expected. Words like "error", "not reading balance correctly", "can not deposit", and "0 balance" indicate negative experiences. Even though some messages are neutral (like providing links or asking for addresses), the overall tone is driven by the problem they're facing. The support message is positive, but it's from a bot and the user is still having issues. So the negative sentiment from the user's repeated complaints probably outweighs the neutral or helpful responses. I should check if there's any positive language, but I don't see much. The users are just trying to fix a problem, so the sentiment is likely negative.
</think>

The sentiment of this text is **negative**.  

The conversation revolves around technical issues with depositing BNB tokens on the Osmosis platform, where users report errors (e.g., "balance is displaying 0," "squid is error also") and frustration over unresolved problems. While some messages provide neutral troubleshooting suggestions (e.g., sharing links to support or alternative tools), the dominant tone is dissatisfaction due to functional failures affecting user experience. The repeated complaints and inability to complete basic actions (like deposits) reinforce the negative sentiment.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message to understand the context.

Starting from the earliest message, kjonnnn at 03:49 asks for Osmosis testnet tokens. Then GPKwee asks for their Osmo address at 03:50. That seems like a next step: GPKwee needs the address to send tokens. 

Moving on, ngantran82 reports an issue at 04:13 about depositing BNB from BNB chain showing 0 balance. GPKwee responds at 03:50 (wait, the timestamps are a bit out of order here; maybe a typo?) asking for the transaction hash. But ngantran82 clarifies that there's no transaction needed, just the balance display issue. Then GPKwee suggests using BNB.axl link and later mentions using Squid router. 

So GPKwee is providing solutions: first checking the transaction, then offering alternative deposit methods via BNB.axl and Squid. The user ngantran82 is experiencing a problem, and GPKwee is guiding them through steps. Also, there's a mention of Axelar having a problem, so maybe a decision to wait for Axelar's fix. 

I need to list each action item, decision, or next step. Let's check each line again. 

kjonnnn needs testnet tokens, so GPKwee's request for the address is an action item. Then ngantran82's issue leads to GPKwee suggesting alternative deposit methods. Also, ngantran82 mentions Squid is erroring, so maybe that's a note but not an action. Then GPKwee provides a Squid link, which is a next step. The user says balance isn't reading correctly, so the action items are: check transaction, use alternative deposit links, wait for Axelar fix, and request address for testnet tokens.

I should structure these into clear points, making sure to attribute each to the correct user and message. Also, note the timestamp order might be a bit confusing, but the content is more important. Need to ensure that each extracted item is accurate and not missing any context.
