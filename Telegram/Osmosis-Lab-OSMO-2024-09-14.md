## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different people, mostly about Osmosis and related issues.

First, I need to identify the main topics. Looking through the messages, there are a few recurring themes. There's a lot about low liquidity in the Terra pools on Osmosis, with users like zicha110001 and kychuli discussing how Luna's volume is higher than liquidity, making it hard to execute big orders. They mention increasing incentives or swap fees to attract liquidity. BasementNodes and cryptotrainJapan are talking about a Telegram premium account and maybe some support issues, with cryptotrainJapan complaining about a contact blocking after one message. There's also a user asking about Medibloc deposits not showing up in the IBC tab, and kychuli gives steps to manually add channels in Keplr with developer mode. Osmosis_statbot keeps pointing to the support site.

So the key points are: liquidity issues in Terra pools, suggestions to adjust incentives/swap fees, the need to manually add channels in Keplr, support links provided, and some side comments about Telegram. Decisions might include considering increasing incentives, using developer mode to add channels, and directing users to support. I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without getting bogged down in the back-and-forth banter. Also, note the recurring official support link. Avoid including less relevant messages like davidjgoosey's block comment unless it's part of a decision. Focus on actionable items and main problems discussed.

- **Liquidity Concerns:** Users highlight low liquidity in Osmosis' Terra pools, noting Luna's volume exceeds liquidity due to the Terra Liquidity Alliance. Suggestions include increasing incentives or swap fees (e.g., 8% proposed) to attract liquidity.

- **Support Resources:** Osmosis Statbot repeatedly directs users to the official support site (https://support.osmosis.zone).

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to read through all the chat messages to understand what they're discussing.

Looking at the text, there are several repeated mentions of "osmosis.zone" and "BasementNodes". The Osmosis support bot is frequently posting the same message about visiting their support site. That seems like a main topic. Then, there's a conversation around liquidity issues in the Terra pools on Osmosis, with users like zicha110001 and kychuli discussing low liquidity and swap fees. They mention increasing incentives to improve liquidity, so that's another topic.

There's a part where they talk about using Telegram, specifically a premium Telegram, and someone mentions blocking due to spam. That might relate to communication channels or support methods. Also, some users are discussing how to add channels manually in Keplr, which is a wallet for Cosmos. That's about wallet configuration or technical steps.

Other messages mention IBC transfers, needing a PC instead of mobile, and problems with Medibloc deposits. These could be technical issues related to using the platform. The user "cryptotrainJapan" is talking about contact methods and being the official spokesman, which might tie into support or community management.

I should group similar points together. The main topics seem to be: Osmosis support, liquidity issues in Terra pools, swap fees, Telegram communication, blocking/spam issues, using Keplr wallet (manual setup), IBC transfer process, platform technical difficulties (like Medibloc deposits), and maybe community management or spokesperson roles. Also, the mention of developer mode and advanced settings in the wallet could be part of technical instructions.

Wait, but I need to make sure each topic is distinct. Maybe combine Osmosis support and the support site link into one. Liquidity and incentives for Terra pools are connected. Telegram premium and blocking are separate but related to communication. The technical steps for Keplr and IBC transfers are part of the same process. Medibloc deposits being empty is a specific issue. Also, the part about using a PC vs mobile is a technical usability topic.

So the final list should include: Osmosis support, liquidity issues, Terra pools, swap fees, Telegram communication, blocking/spam, Keplr wallet setup, IBC transfers, Medibloc deposits, platform usability, community

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start by reading through all the texts.

The first message from cryptotrainJapan says, "I have a premium telegram, it‚Äôs probably clear that telegram is working." Hmm, they mention having a premium Telegram and that it's working. That sounds positive because they're indicating things are functioning as expected. 

Next, davidjgoosey writes, "Sorry getting lots of spam lately so been more liberal with the blocks- feel free to reach out." The apology suggests they might be blocking people due to spam, which could be a negative situation, but the sentiment here is more neutral since it's an explanation and an invitation to reach out. 

osmosis_statbot's message is a standard support link. It's just providing information, so definitely neutral. 

BasementNodes says "more or less." That's a bit vague. It's a neutral response, not showing strong positive or negative emotion. 

cryptotrainJapan's next message: "No activity for 12k people... Marketer @davidjgoosey and you're good üòÇ" The mention of no activity might be negative, but the use of üòÇ and the sarcasm could indicate a negative sentiment. The user is pointing out a lack of activity, which is a complaint, so maybe negative here. 

Then BasementNodes says, "way to leave me hanging." That's clearly negative, showing frustration or disappointment. 

cryptotrainJapan's message: "I'm the official spokesman, you'll regret it.üòá" The wink and angel emoji might be playful, but the statement "you'll regret it" is negative. However, given the context, it could be a joke, so maybe neutral? But the threat implies a negative undertone. 

BasementNodes: "nice cosmobot" ‚Äì positive, straightforward compliment. 

cryptotrainJapan: "This is a terrible contact, is there a more normal one that doesn't throw you on the block at 1 msg?" The word "terrible" is clearly negative. They're unhappy with the contact method blocking after one message. 

BasementNodes shares a Telegram link. That's just a link, so neutral. 

WorkerBee_3: "Only basement nodes can give the best support" ‚Äì positive sentiment towards Basement

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a series of chat messages from different participants. I need to go through each message and identify any specific actions that need to be taken, decisions made, or next steps mentioned.

Starting with the first message from cryptotrainJapan at 22:06:11. They mention having a premium Telegram and that it's clear Telegram is working. Not sure if that's an action item. Maybe not, just a statement.

Next, davidjgoosey at 22:05:11 says they've been blocking a lot due to spam and invites the person to reach out. Again, seems like a notification rather than an action item. Unless the action is to reach out, but maybe that's not the main point here.

Osmosis_statbot at 21:57:27 links to their support site. That's a recurring message. The action here would be to visit the support site if help is needed. But since it's a bot message, maybe it's just providing a resource.

BasementNodes at 21:32:47 says "more or less." Not really an action item. cryptotrainJapan at 21:32:22 is making a comment about no activity and mentions a marketer, but that's probably a joke. Not an action.

BasementNodes at 21:30:40 says "way to leave me hanging." That's a complaint, no action. cryptotrainJapan at 21:30:30 says they're the official spokesman, which might be a role claim but not an action.

BasementNodes at 21:30:27 says "nice cosmobot." Just a compliment. cryptotrainJapan at 21:29:49 asks if there's a more normal contact method, implying they might want to change contacts. Maybe an action item to find a better contact method.

BasementNodes at 17:17:18 provides a Telegram link. Maybe the action here is to contact them via that link. WorkerBee_3 at 17:15:25 says only Basement Nodes can give the best support. So maybe the next step is to reach out to Basement Nodes.
