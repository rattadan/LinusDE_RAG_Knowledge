I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

The reason for this is that delaying the assignment
here will definitely waste time as all available vehicles in this setting
are immediately available to serve the open requests. When comparing
the results of the two specifications all/non-serving vehicles, using all
vehicles in the assignment leads to the best results, with the exception

6.2. Assignment analysis
In what follows, we compare the quality of the nearest strategy with
different matching strategies. For all experiments in this section, we use
the intuitive global unrestricted matching approach with a repositioning interval of ùõøùëÖ = 15 min. In order to guide the reader through the
analysis and discussion, questions and answers are provided. When do matching-based approaches outperform the nearest
strategy? We compare the nearest strategy with the matching-based
strategy for different matching intervals ùõøùëÄ and different vehicles
available for assignment. Table 2 summarizes the results for fleet size
ùëâ = 100.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes:**

1. **Repositioning Interval (ùõøùëÖ):** The repositioning interval is defined as a fixed time period of 15 minutes. This implies that vehicles can be assigned to other locations within this timeframe.
2. **Matching Strategy:** There are two matching strategies mentioned:
	* Nearest strategy: an intuitive global unrestricted matching approach.
	* Matching-based strategy: not explicitly described, but implied to be a different method of assignment that is being compared to the nearest strategy.

**Context Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

1. The current text chunk is connected to the overall topic of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.
2. It builds upon the surrounding context by introducing specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:
	* The goal of minimizing waste time and maximizing the quality of vehicle assignments.
	* The use of all available vehicles in the assignment for the best results (except for a trivial case).
3. The chunk also references other relevant concepts from previous texts on dynamic dispatch, simulation, and deep learning approaches.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. **Fleet Size:** A fleet size of 100 is specified as the reference scenario.
2. **Matching Intervals:** The matching intervals ùõøùëÄ are not explicitly defined in this chunk, but they are mentioned as a general concept to be compared with the nearest strategy.
3. **Vehicle Availability:** Vehicles are considered available for assignment when there are no open requests, implying that the system must manage idle vehicles effectively.

This text chunk provides specific details about dynamic dispatch and real-time management techniques, including repositioning strategies and matching approaches, within the context of ride-hailing systems.
