# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_47.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.avax.network/*

### Document Overview  
This content discusses the Codebase program's storytelling workshops and the benefits of an ecosystem approach for founders, emphasizing access to Ava Labs' advisors and tools.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Storytelling Workshops**: Mandatory for founders to hone communication skills, with workshops held during the first week of the Codebase program.  
- **Ava Labs Advisors**: Access to a network of operators, founders, investors, and commercial partners, enabling founders to leverage institutional knowledge.  
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Founders are required to understand Avalanche’s consensus mechanisms (e.g., Avalanche9000) but do not need deep development experience.  
- **Technical Expertise**: Ava Labs provides tooling and resources to develop dApps, reducing the need for in-depth coding experience.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Workshop Structure**: Storytelling workshops are integrated into the Codebase program, with founders practicing pitch preparation during the first week.  
- **Ecosystem Access**: Founders gain access to Ava Labs’ tools, resources, and advisors via the Codebase program, enabling collaboration with institutional experts.  
- **Communication Channels**: Advisors are connected via Telegram, allowing real-time collaboration and knowledge sharing.  

### Related Topics  
- **Codebase Program**: The program’s structure and goals are referenced in the context of storytelling and resource access.  
- **Ava Labs Tools**: The document connects to the broader ecosystem of tools and resources available through Ava Labs, emphasizing their role in supporting dApp development.  
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: The content ties to the technical foundation of Avalanche’s network, highlighting how founders must align with its architectural principles.

bar, it wonât matter if theyâve built a great product that meets a critical customer need because no one will buy it. âWho cares about your idea if you don't know how to communicate it?" says Martin. "No one will care unless you can find a way to tell them otherwise."

Prioritizing Storytelling

Storytelling workshops have, as a result, always been an integral part of the Codebase program. But one of the major pieces of feedback from founders in the first cohort was that they wanted more access to storytelling support, which was only offered during the final weeks of the program. So for Cohort 2, Codebase launched storytelling workshops for founders during the first week of the program so they could hone this skill in preparation for Demo Day, where storytelling is paramount.Â

Storytelling is just one support lever founders can pull during their time in the incubator. By participating in the Codebase program, they are also able to access a broad network of Ava Labsâ advisors that include operators, founders, investors, and commercial partners. Founders essentially have an entire consultancy at their disposal and for Martin, one of the biggest insights from Cohort 2 was the tremendous value that this ecosystem approach unlocked for builders.

âFounders are able to access all these tools, resources, and people because the Codebase program is embedded in Ava Labs,â he says. âWe have an immense amount of institutional knowledge that is always just a Telegram message away.âÂ

Although founders are expected to have a basic understanding of Avalancheâs consensus mechanisms and the general thesis behind Avalanche9000 when they apply to Codebase, they donât need to have deep experience actually developing dApps on Avalanche. For that, they can rely on the technical expertise and tooling developed over the past eight years at Ava Labs.
