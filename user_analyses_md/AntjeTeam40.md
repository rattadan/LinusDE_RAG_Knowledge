I need to analyze these tweets from the given account. Let me break down the analysis according to the requested categories:

- Upcoming official wallet launch
- Web3 technology

2. Language style and tone:
The language style is formal to semi-formal with some promotional elements:
- In the first tweet, it's primarily informative with somewhat formal German ("Schweizer Stiftung soll Bitpanda-Token im Wert von hunderten Millionen Euro bekommen")
- The second tweet uses English with emojis and enthusiastic language ("Stay tuned, it'll be worth it!") indicating a promotion/marketing tone
- Both tweets include hashtags and mentions typical of social media promotion

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
- The tweets reference specific projects (Bitpanda) and technological developments (Solana integration)
- They appear to be sharing news rather than making unrealistic promises
- The presence of image URLs in one tweet adds some credibility
- The account appears to have a specific focus on Bitpanda developments
- No obvious red flags about legitimacy, but the account seems to be promoting Bitpanda specifically rather than offering balanced analysis

They're positioning themselves as a source for important updates about Bitpanda, suggesting they either work for the company or are strongly aligned with its goals. The use of multiple languages may indicate a target audience in German-speaking European countries.
