### Document Overview  
The content discusses trading Bitcoin perpetuals on dYdX, highlights Bitcoin's supply mechanism (21 million coins, PoW, and halving), and explains the role of Satoshi Nakamoto in its creation and distribution.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Bitcoin Supply Chain**: 21 million total coins, with block rewards halved every four years (halving) to maintain scarcity.  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Bitcoin's consensus mechanism where miners solve complex math puzzles to validate transactions.  
- **Block Rewards**: Initial 50 BTC per block, reduced by half every four years (halving).  
- **Blockchain**: Decentralized public ledger for recording Bitcoin transactions.  
- **Nakamoto's Holdings**: Estimated 1 million BTC held across multiple wallets, representing ~5% of total supply.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Halving Mechanism**: Block rewards are reduced by 50% every 210,000 blocks (4 years), ensuring controlled supply growth.  
- **PoW Process**: Miners compete to solve puzzles, with the first solver adding a new block to the blockchain.  
- **Block Reward Distribution**: Initial 50 BTC per block, later reduced to 25 BTC, then 12.5 BTC, etc.  
- **Blockchain Structure**: Blocks linked via timestamps, with each block containing transaction data and a hash of the previous block.  

### Related Topics  
- **Blockchain Technology**: The content ties to the broader discussion of Bitcoin's decentralized ledger and its role in cryptocurrency trading.  
- **Cryptocurrency Mechanics**: The technical concepts align with the legitimacy disclaimer, emphasizing Bitcoin's scarcity and Nakamoto's influence.

h2: Legitimacy and Disclaimer

Despite steep price corrections over the years, Bitcoin (BTC) remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies of the 21st century.

Since Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins, large Bitcoin holders (or "whales") have considerable sway over the world's largest cryptocurrency. So who owns the most Bitcoin?Â

Itâs estimated that Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, holds the largest amount of BTC. Their large cache is believed to comprise at least 1 million BTC held across thousands of crypto wallets. At the time of writing, Nakamoto's Bitcoin portfolio accounts for approximately 5% of BTCâs total supply.

One year after publishing the 2008 whitepaper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," an individual or group who calls themselves Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin using an algorithm called "Proof-of-Work" (PoW). In Bitcoin's PoW system, computers compete to solve a complex math problem every 10 minutes. The first computer that successfully solves each math puzzle can post a newly verified block of BTC transactions on a decentralized public payment ledger (or "blockchain").

To encourage more people to join the Bitcoin blockchain, Nakamoto offered "BTC block rewards" to any computer that successfully solves each math problem. These block rewards introduces new BTC into circulation (a process called "mining") until the total supply hits 21 million coins. In 2009, Nakamoto set Bitcoin's average block reward at 50 BTC every 10 minutes. However, this supply is cut in half every four years in an event called "the halvening" to maintain scarcity.

Because few people knew BTC existed in 2009, Nakamoto was the only person or group collecting BTC block rewards. Most crypto analytics firms believe Nakamoto stored these coins in various wallet addresses before formallyleaving the Bitcoin projectin December 2010.
