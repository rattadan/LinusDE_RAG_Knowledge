"Not even Telegram is what it used to be anymore! How do some of theirs take the truth from here?" with the image showing a Telegram channel discussing cryptocurrency.

The author appears to be criticizing Telegram channels (possibly crypto-related based on the image) for spreading unreliable information. This fits with concerns about information quality on messaging platforms, especially regarding cryptocurrency topics which often involve speculative investments or potential scams.
