I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

In case the total
supply is bigger than the target supply (i.e., in total there are more
vehicles available than needed), a fictitious demand node is added. The costs for the transport are the distances between the zone centers. The costs associated with the edges connected to the artificial demand
node are 0. Afterwards, for each zone serving as a real supply node,
it has to be determined which of the vehicles are shifted to which of
the designated demand nodes. This is done by solving a cost-minimum
linear assignment problem with the available vehicles in the supply
zone and the parking lots closest to the center of the associated demand
zones. If more than one vehicle should be sent to the same demand
zone, the respective parking lot is cloned as often as necessary in the
assignment problem. We want to emphasize the importance of the length of the timeframe the demand estimation is done for. This plays a crucial role for
the quality of the version where no more repositioning than necessary
should be done.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section provides detailed technical details on the process described in the original text chunk.

**Context:** The context provided includes a list of key references on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, which serves as background information for understanding the topic being discussed.

**Technical Details:**

* Dynamic dispatch involves assigning vehicles to specific demand zones based on their availability and proximity.
* A fictitious demand node is added if there are more vehicles available than needed, indicating a surplus of supply over target demand.
* The costs associated with transporting vehicles are calculated using distances between zone centers.
* A cost-minimum linear assignment problem (MLAP) is used to determine which vehicles should be shifted to each demand zone. If multiple vehicles are sent to the same demand zone, their parking lot is cloned as necessary.
* The timeframe for demand estimation and dynamic dispatch has a significant impact on the quality of the result.

**Building upon the surrounding context:**

This section connects to the original text by providing additional technical details on the process of dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems. It builds upon the context provided earlier, which discussed simulation and modeling techniques, dynamic dispatch, rebalancing strategies, demand forecasting, and simulation platforms.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this section. However, the following assumptions can be made:

* The system has a finite supply of vehicles and demand nodes.
* The system is modeled as a graph, with zone centers and demand zones being connected by edges.
* The cost of transporting vehicles is directly related to their distance from the zone center.
* The system requires an efficient allocation of vehicles between demand zones to minimize costs and maximize efficiency.
