The tweet seems to be from the official ETHBelgrade account, not an individual, so character evaluation is less applicable. However:

Contextualizing intentions:
This tweet is clearly part of promoting the ETHBelgrade conference and its affiliated projects. By encouraging people to find them to get a Lido coded pin, they're trying to:
- Drive attendance at their booth/stall at the event
- Increase interest in Lido Network among Ethereum developers
- Build community through physical engagement at a conference
- Create a sense of excitement and exclusivity around their offerings
