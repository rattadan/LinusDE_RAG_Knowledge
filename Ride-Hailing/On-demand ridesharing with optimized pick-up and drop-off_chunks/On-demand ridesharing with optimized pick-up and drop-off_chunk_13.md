**Original Text:**

Vehicles can get close to most points within a city using mainly medium or large
streets, but reaching an exact point usually requires driving through some slow streets, i.e., the case illustrated in Fig. 1 can be usual2. Fig. 2 shows how avoiding detours can be very significant when several users share flexible routes. In this example, with only two
sharing passengers, the vehicle needs to turn a corner seven times and cross the street from where it came three times (top row),
inducing a severe extra time that is wholly saved when short walks are admitted (bottom row). Although most flexible systems provide door-to-door services, there are real-life examples that do ask passengers to walk. The most
usual ones are some airport shuttles that pick-up passengers in a predefined meeting point; this is the case, for instance, in Madrid,
Melbourne, and Sidney.
