proceed to study the spatial distribution of the quality of service. In Figs. 8–11 we show the spatial distribution of the different indices. In order to emphasize the differences in space, for each index we show the relative values, i.e., we focus on depicting where do each
index take its maximum, minimum and intermediate numbers (rather than the absolute numbers, already discussed in Table 6). We
now explain in detail each of these Figures. Fig.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is explaining a specific section within the reference list that discusses the spatial distribution of quality of service indices for ridesharing systems.

**Technical details:**
- The figure being described (Fig. 11) shows the departure and arrival points for rejected requests, with red indicating areas where more concentration occurs.
- Table 7 is also discussed, which presents correlation between average indices and distance from Times Square to Origin (O) or Destination (D).

**Context:** This section builds upon the surrounding context by providing a detailed explanation of the spatial distribution of quality of service indices. It seems that the authors are analyzing how these indices vary in different locations within New York City, specifically focusing on areas near popular destinations like Times Square.

**Requirements and constraints:**
- The analysis requires access to data related to rejected requests for ridesharing services in specific locations across NYC.
- Understanding of spatial distribution concepts is necessary to interpret the figures and correlate the indices with their respective distances from key points (Times Square).

By breaking down this technical information into detailed explanations, the authors are providing a clear context for understanding how quality of service indices are calculated and used within ridesharing systems. This analysis can help identify areas where improvement may be most beneficial and inform design decisions or optimization strategies for ride-sharing services.
