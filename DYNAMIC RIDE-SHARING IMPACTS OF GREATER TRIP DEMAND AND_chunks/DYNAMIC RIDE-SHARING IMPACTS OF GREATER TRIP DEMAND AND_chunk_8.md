## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 8

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

Similarly, Tu et al.â€™s (2019) DRS algorithm improved shareability from 7%
to nearly 90%, along with time savings of at least 10%. Diversifying SAV fleet vehicles to
include more seats is another option, that is less of a divergence from traditional, fixed-route,
fixed-schedule transit systems. Martinez and Viegas (2017) achieved a 30% reduction in VMT
by using a mixture of 4-, 8- and 16- seater SAVs in their simulation for Lisbon, Portugal. VMT

savings largely stemmed from high fleet AVO values greater than 4.0 persons per vehicle (4.2
for 8-seater vehicles and 11.4 for 16-seater vehicles). Assuming that travelers do share their rides
(with strangers), fleet efficiency in catering to diverse demand and land use profiles remains a
concern.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes:**

1. **DRS algorithm**: A data-driven routing (DDR) algorithm, also known as Demand Response Service (DRS), is used to optimize shareability among shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) fleet vehicles. The algorithm improves the sharing ratio from 7% to nearly 90%.
2. **Time savings**: The DRS algorithm reduces time savings of at least 10%, indicating a significant improvement in the efficiency of SAV fleets.
3. **Fleet composition**: The use of diversifying SAV fleet vehicles, including more seats (e.g., 4-, 8-, and 16-seaters), is suggested as another option to reduce divergence from traditional fixed-route, fixed-schedule transit systems.

**Contextual Connection:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing specific technical details about the DRS algorithm.
2. Highlighting the benefits of improved shareability (7% to nearly 90%) and time savings (at least 10%).
3. Mentioning fleet composition as a potential solution, specifically diversifying SAV fleets with more seats.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The requirements mentioned in this chunk are:

1. Specific data-driven routing (DDR) algorithm.
2. High fleet Average Occupancy Values (AOV).
3. Diversion from traditional fixed-route, fixed-schedule transit systems.

Overall, this chunk is explaining the technical details and benefits of a specific algorithm used to improve shareability among SAV fleets, while also highlighting key conditions (high AOVs) that support its effectiveness.
