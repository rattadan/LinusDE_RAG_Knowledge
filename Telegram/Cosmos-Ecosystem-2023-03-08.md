## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. The text includes several Twitter posts from different accounts on March 8, 2023.

First, there's a message from krychevskyi about Everstake's Everpiggy program. The numbers here are important: 1,338 users joined, received over 11,637 Everpiggies. The biggest reward was 92.79 ATOM, and the friendliest user invited 251 referrals. I should note that they're promoting the program with a link to a thread.

Then there are multiple combot entries. The first two mention a live session with Notional DAO and Gadikian, hosted by Citizen Cosmos. The key points here are the collaboration and the event details. Another combot tweet is a retweet about Cosmos Daily News, highlighting support through retweets and listing several tokens and projects. The SukritiTaneja message is about pSTAKE surpassing 250,000 ATOM staked in under two months, indicating growth and success.

I need to identify the main events and achievements. The Everpiggy program stats, the live sessions with Notional DAO, the Cosmos Daily News promotion, and pSTAKE's milestone. Each of these should be a bullet point. Also, note the URLs as references but maybe not include them in the summary unless necessary. The user wants key points, so numbers and notable achievements are crucial. Decisions might include promoting the Everpiggy program, hosting live sessions, and the growth of pSTAKE. I should structure the summary to highlight each project's key metrics and the collaborative events mentioned.

**Summary:**  
1. **Everstake‚Äôs Everpiggy Program**: 1,338 users joined, earning 11,637 Everpiggies. Top reward: 92.79 ATOM; most referrals by a user: 251.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to understand the structure of the text. It looks like a series of chat messages or tweets, each with timestamps and usernames.

Starting with the first message from krychevskyi. It mentions Everstake's Everpiggy program, 1,338 users joined, 11,637 Everpiggies received, the biggest reward was 92.79 ATOM, and a user invited 251 referrals. The link points to a Twitter thread. The main topics here are Everstake, Everpiggy program, user participation numbers, rewards in ATOM, referrals.

Next, combot's messages. The first one refers to a tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem about watching Notional DAO and Gadikian with Citizen Cosmos. The topics here are Cosmos Ecosystem, Notional DAO, Citizen Cosmos, and maybe an event or discussion. The second combot message is a retweet from Cosmos Voice about going live with Notional DAO in 20 minutes. So again, Cosmos Ecosystem, Notional DAO, live event, latest plans. The third combot message is the same as the second, so maybe a duplicate. Then another combot message from earlier about Cosmos Daily News, showing support with RT, and mentions several cryptocurrencies like ATOM, INJ, KAVA, etc., and their respective Twitter handles. Topics here would be Cosmos Daily News, cryptocurrency support (ATOM, INJ, KAVA, etc.), and promoting awareness through retweets.

The last message from SukritiTaneja talks about Liquid Staking era, pSTAKE surpassing 250,000+ ATOM staked in two months, and a link to a Twitter post. Main topics are Liquid Staking, pSTAKE, ATOM staking growth.

Now, I need to compile all these topics without repetition. Let's list them out:

- Everstake‚Äôs Everpiggy program
- User participation (1,338 users)
- Everpiggies received (11,637)
- ATOM rewards (92.79)
- Referrals (251)
- Cosmos Ecosystem
- Notional DAO
- Citizen Cosmos
- Live event
- Latest plans of Not

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided several Twitter messages related to the Cosmos ecosystem and wants to know the sentiment of each as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with the first one from krychevskyi. It mentions that in Everstake's Everpiggy program, 1,338 users have joined and received over 11,637 Everpiggies. The biggest reward was 92.79 ATOM, and someone invited 251 referrals. The user is directing people to check the thread. This seems like promotional content highlighting success metrics. Positive words like "already joined," "receiving over," "biggest reward," and "friendliest user" indicate a positive sentiment. So, that's positive.

Next, the combot messages from CosmosEcosystem. The first one says they're preparing to watch Notional DAO and Gadikian with Citizen Cosmos, and it should be interesting. Words like "interesting" can be positive, especially in context of anticipation. The second combot message is a retweet announcing going live in 20 minutes, inviting others to join and find out about plans. Retweets like this are usually neutral, but since they're promoting an event, maybe positive. Wait, but the user might consider RTs as neutral unless there's explicit positive language. Let me check again. The original tweet says "We are set to go live... Join to find out..." which is encouraging. The RT might be neutral but the content is positive. Hmm, maybe the sentiment here is positive because they're excited about the event.

Another combot message from earlier mentions Cosmos Daily News, asks for support with RT, says they keep spreading the word, and lists several tokens. The use of emojis like üî• and slogans like "We keep spreading the word!" suggests enthusiasm. This is definitely positive as it's promoting their efforts and encouraging engagement.

Then there's SukritiTaneja's message about Liquid Staking era, pSTAKE surpassing 250,000+ ATOM staked in two months, calling it just the start with a winking emoji. Words like "surpassed," "just a start," and the emoji indicate optimism and achievement. This is clearly positive.

Now, checking for any negative or neutral parts. The combot messages are retweets,

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. First, I need to understand the structure of the text. It looks like a series of chat messages or tweets from different users.

Starting with the first message from krychevskyi. They mention Everstake's Everpiggy program stats: 1,338 users, 11,637 Everpiggies, biggest reward 92.79 ATOM, and a user with 251 referrals. The message ends with a link to a thread. The action item here might be to check out the thread for more details. So, I should note that as a next step.

Next, combot has a few entries. The first one is a tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem about watching NotionalDAO and Gadikian with Citizen Cosmos. The link is provided. The action here is to view the tweet, but since it's a tweet, maybe the next step is to watch the live session they're promoting. However, the user might just want the extraction of the tweet's content. Then another RT from Cosmos Ecosystem about going live with NotionalDAO in 20 minutes. The action item here is the upcoming live event. But since the timestamp is in the past (2023-03-08), maybe it's already happened. Still, the user might want to note that they should have joined then.

Another combot message is a daily news tweet with hashtags and mentions, encouraging RTs. The action item here is to retweet or support with RT. Also, the link provided might be to the news.

Then SukritiTaneja's message about Liquid Staking era and pSTAKE surpassing 250,000 ATOM staked in two months. The link is to their tweet. The action here is to check out the tweet for more info.

So, compiling all these, the main action items are checking the provided links for more details, retweeting the news, and possibly joining live events (though they're in the past). Since the user might be looking for current steps, even if the events are past, I should list them as mentioned. Also, need to ensure not to miss any other potential actions. Decisions or next steps aren't explicitly stated beyond promoting these tweets, so the extraction focuses
