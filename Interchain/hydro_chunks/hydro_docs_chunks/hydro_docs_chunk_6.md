**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

Approved bids are submitted to the Hydro contract from a whitelisted address. Once on-chain, projects can start adding tribute to their bids. ### Voting Power
------------

From Round 2 onwards, users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them the flexibility to participate in multi-month deployments. However:

Users cannot vote for a deployment with a duration longer than their ATOM lockup. Voting for a multi-month deployment ties the associated voting power to that bid for the entire duration. To vote in future rounds, users will need to create new lockups. This system balances user flexibility with the need for effective governance. ### Tranches
--------

A tranche is a sub-pool of liquidity within a liquidity bucket, such as a dedicated ICS tranche (reserved for ICS project bids). There will not be any tranches during the Pilot Rounds.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the Text Chunk:

1. **Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes Described:**
   - The approved bids are submitted to the Hydro contract from a whitelisted address.
   - Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months.
   - Users cannot vote for a deployment with a duration longer than their ATOM lockup.
   - Voting for a multi-month deployment ties the associated voting power to that bid for the entire duration.
   - Users need to create new lockups to vote in future rounds.
   - A tranche is a sub-pool of liquidity within a liquidity bucket (defined as a dedicated ICS tranche for ICS project bids).
   - Tranches are not introduced during the Pilot Rounds.

2. **Connection to or Building upon the Surrounding Context:**
   - The text chunk is a continuation of the Key Components and Processes section, specifically mentioning the voting power mechanism.
   - The concept of tranches is also mentioned, but explained as not being introduced during the Pilot Rounds.
   - The section maintains consistency with the APY and Rewards, Lockups and Voting Power, and Pilot Rounds and Objectives described in the document.

3. **Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**
   - Users can lock their ATOM for up to 3 months.
   - Users must create new lockups to vote in future rounds after participating in multi-month deployments.
   - Tranches are not part of the Pilot Rounds.

**Ambiguities or 'Facts' in the Text Chunk:**
- The text does not explain how or when the whitelisted address is approved or verified.
- The phrase "for the entire duration" can be interpreted as either referring to the deployment duration or the lockup duration; however, given the context, it is likely referring to the deployment duration.
