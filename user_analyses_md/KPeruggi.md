**Context**

The tweets appear to be from the account @KPeruggi, which seems to be promoting the project Kappa (also known as KPeruggi) in some form. The content is informal and centered around discussing cryptocurrency prices, market trends, and community engagement.

However, the presence of 900+ ETH on a presale indicates that Kappa might be more than just a cryptocurrency or blockchain project â€“ it could also represent an investment opportunity or a new platform for various financial instruments.
