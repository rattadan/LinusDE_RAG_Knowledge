I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

In our
experiments, minimizing travel times to pickup locations never leads
to worse results than minimizing the waiting times; often the results in
terms of service rate and waiting time are slightly or moderately better. Maximizing the reward gained leads to the worst service rate since
longer requests are preferred. Even when comparing the total reward
instead of the service rate, this strategy still produces slightly worse
results than the other strategies due to its greedy character. Minimizing
distances or travel times to the drop-off locations prioritizes shorter requests. This strategy results in approximately 2% more served requests
in settings where the other strategies have a service rate of less than
85%. However, the total distance traveled with customers on board
is reduced by 7%. The preference for shorter requests (and therefore
unequal treatment of customers) is also apparent when considering the
correlation between request distance and request rejection, increasing
from 0.06 to 0.41.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**1. Technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk:**
The technical details mentioned are:

- Simulation: The use of a simulation platform (DIMACS Center for Discrete Mathematics: Hailing challenge) is not explicitly stated but implied by the fact that references to specific methodologies and datasets are provided.
- Modeling: The concept of dynamic dispatch and repositioning using a spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network is mentioned, as well as real-world ride-hailing vehicle repositioning using deep RL.

**2. Connection to or building upon the surrounding context:**
The current text chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

- Providing an overview of previous research on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.
- Offering a comparison between different strategies (minimizing travel times vs. minimizing waiting times, maximizing reward) to highlight the trade-offs involved.
- Describing specific results and metrics from experiments conducted using the mentioned methodologies.

**3. Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:**
The text chunk does not explicitly mention any specific requirements or conditions but can be inferred as follows:

- The context is a ride-hailing system, which implies that the solution should take into account various factors such as traffic, driver availability, and demand.
- The goal is to optimize real-time management in the system, suggesting that the solution should consider both the current state of the system (e.g., travel times) and future plans or expectations (e.g., waiting times).
- The use of deep RL for repositioning vehicles implies a need for computational resources, data availability, and possibly some constraints on the type of vehicles or environments being modeled.

Overall, the text chunk aims to provide a framework for comparing different strategies in dynamic dispatch and real-time management, highlighting the challenges and trade-offs involved.
