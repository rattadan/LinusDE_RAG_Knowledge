Contextualized tweets:

The first tweet appears to be from an individual advocating for stricter regulations on carbon credits, with a sense of urgency and alarm. They reference recent regulatory changes (the "wild legislation") and seem to be arguing that these changes will lead to catastrophic consequences ("a horrible death soon").

The second tweet seems to be a humorous or sarcastic response to the first one, poking fun at the idea of speculating about economic collapse. The tone is lighthearted but may also contain a hint of irreverence or ridicule.
