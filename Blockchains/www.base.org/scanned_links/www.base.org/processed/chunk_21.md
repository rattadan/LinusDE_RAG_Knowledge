Basenames are a core onchain building block that enable builders to establish their identity on Base by registering human-readable names for their wallet address(es). They are fully onchain, built on the same technology powering ENS names, and deployed on Base. These human-readable names can be used when connecting to onchain apps, and sending and receiving on Base and any other EVM chain.
