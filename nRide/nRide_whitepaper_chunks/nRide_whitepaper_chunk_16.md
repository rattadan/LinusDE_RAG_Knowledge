This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

The other user will
need to obtain the private key - the secret - to unlock their deposit. Users exchange secrets offline, and the
procedure for doing so is not covered by the protocol (could be by tapping phones through NFC, or by
sending a message over the NKN network). The escrow smart-contract implements a state machine that
guards all possible transitions and outputs given initial configuration and the messages submitted by the
users. How it works:
Both parties, A and B, lock the same amount of tokens in the smart contract. Once the funds are locked,
each party can send one of two messages to the smartÂ contract:
Approve(secret)
A message containing the counterparty’s secret. Cancel

A message signifying the user’s desire to redeem a proportion of their deposit prior to
completion, or because they failed to obtain the other user’s secret.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I'll provide a focused analysis of this specific text chunk.

**Technical Details:**

* The private key is mentioned as being used for unlocking a deposit by both parties, A and B.
* The procedure for obtaining the private key involves exchanging secrets offline, which could be achieved through NFC or sending messages over the NKN network.
* The escrow smart-contract implements a state machine that guards all possible transitions and outputs given initial configuration and the messages submitted by users.

**How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:**

This chunk appears to be building upon the previous text, which discussed the nRide platform's mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals. Specifically, it focuses on the escrow mechanism, a key component of the platform that ensures accountability and provides compensation using NRIDE tokens.

**Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

* The private key is necessary for unlocking deposits.
* The procedure for obtaining the private key involves exchanging secrets offline.
* The escrow smart-contract must be implemented to guard all possible transitions and outputs given initial configuration and the messages submitted by users.
