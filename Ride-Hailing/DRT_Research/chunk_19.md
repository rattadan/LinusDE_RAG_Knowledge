A large body of research uses different approaches to study the effects of these factors on the performance of the service. These approaches can be classified generally into two groups: simulations and approximate mathematical methods. Simulation is the appropriate method where the goal is to achieve 
Modeling tools
Agencies possess limited equipment, crews, and facilities with which to operate DRT services, and the costs of acquiring additional resources can be very expensive so agencies have an incentive to use their resources as efficiently as possible. On the other hand, when the demand rate exceeds the operating capacity of the system, users must to tolerate higher delay, in-service travel time, earliness, and lateness due to lack of adequate capacity in the system. To improve the quality of the
System optimum
The inherent tradeoff between the cost and quality of the DRT service necessitates holding a balance between the agency and user costs.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

These two approaches can be beneficial for different aspects of managing Demand Response Transportation (DRT) services:

1. **Simulation**: Using simulation to model the system's behavior, agencies can test different scenarios, identify optimal capacity levels, and evaluate the impact of varying demand rates on service quality. This approach allows for a high degree of flexibility and analysis, enabling agencies to optimize their resources more effectively.
2. **Approximate Mathematical Methods**: These methods, such as queueing theory or linear programming, can provide a more straightforward way to analyze and optimize DRT systems. While they may not offer the same level of flexibility as simulations, they can still be effective in identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and optimizing resource allocation.

By leveraging both approaches, agencies can gain a more comprehensive understanding of their DRT services and make data-driven decisions to improve their quality and efficiency.
