Putting these tweets in the context of her intentions:
Emily appears to be working in crypto marketing (at Hype Partners) and sharing her critical perspective on crypto trends. She's pointing out that some projects (like Believe) are memecoins in disguise, using the framing of legitimate funding platforms to attract users. She's also highlighting that the crypto space (CT = crypto Twitter) is an echo chamber that needs to expand to other platforms like TikTok for real growth. Her comments about TVL suggest she's skeptical of hype-driven metrics and values more substantive measures of success. The tweet about wanting to see "a real tree" rather than the typical crypto symbols (lambos = Lamborghini cars, gwagons = G Wagons) indicates she's tired of the excessive crypto wealth displays.
