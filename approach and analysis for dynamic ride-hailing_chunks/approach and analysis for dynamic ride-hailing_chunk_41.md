I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

Although we do not allow such
a scenario in our setting, their approach can still be used in a modified
way. Over the course of the day, every rejected request is logged. Rejecting a request happens whenever there are not enough vehicles in
the vicinity of the open requests. Therefore, the locations of the rejected
requests indicate areas with undersupply. Provided that the demand
structure is not changing too quickly, this undersupply can be decreased
in the short-term future by sending the available vehicles into these
areas. The pickup location of each rejected request that occurred since
the last repositioning epoch is mapped to its nearest parking lot, and
the solution of a cost-minimum matching problem determines which
vehicle is sent to which parking lot. In settings without a maximum
waiting time, reducing the average waiting time is more often the aim
of the assignment and repositioning strategies, as usually all requests
can be served.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I'll provide a focused analysis of the specific section explaining what this chunk is explaining.

**Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes:**

The chunk describes the process of dynamic dispatch and repositioning in ride-hailing systems, which involves:

1. Mapping rejected requests to their locations (nearest parking lot)
2. Determining which vehicle should be sent to each parking lot using a cost-minimum matching problem
3. Reducing undersupply by sending available vehicles into areas with low demand

**Context Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

1. Referencing previous topics on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, which implies that this information is part of a larger discussion.
2. Providing a specific example of how undersupply can be reduced through repositioning vehicles (over the course of the day).

The chunk also builds upon surrounding context by:

1. Building upon the concept of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems discussed earlier, which suggests that this information is part of a broader discussion on managing ride-hailing systems.
2. Providing specific examples of methodologies and strategies used to address undersupply in these systems, such as Bischoff & Maciejewski's simulation of autonomous taxi deployment in Berlin and Geng et al.'s spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network for demand forecasting.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk.
