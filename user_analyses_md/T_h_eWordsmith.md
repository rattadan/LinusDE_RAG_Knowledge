## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's take a look at this tweet. The user is talking about a "silent war" between blockchains, focusing on features, problem-solving, and repetition. The tone is critical and maybe a bit confrontational. The account is probably promoting something related to blockchain, maybe a project that's trying to stand out. The author might be someone who's passionate about blockchain but critical of others. They might be trying to highlight the competition and the need for innovation. The keywords should reflect the themes like blockchain competition, silent war, features, problem-solving, and repetition. I need to make sure the summary is concise and covers all the points asked.

| messages | There’s been a silent war going on for years now. 

Everywhere you turn, blockchains are trying to prove who’s the best.

➠ Who has better features.

➠ Who’s solving more problems (even when they don't).

➠ Most times, they just keep saying thesame thing in a different way. https://t.co/DJgU6FOIyi |
