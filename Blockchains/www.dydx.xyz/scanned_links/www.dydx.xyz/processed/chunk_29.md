## Source Context
*From: https://www.dydx.xyz/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses Bitcoin and Ethereum's supply mechanisms, including their halving schedules, burn rates, and inflationary/deflationary characteristics, highlighting their differences and potential as digital stores of value.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Halving**: Bitcoin’s supply reduces by half every four years, aiming for a 0% inflation rate by 2140.  
- **Burn Rate**: Ethereum burns a percentage of transaction fees, reducing its supply and making it a deflationary asset when the burn rate exceeds daily issuance.  
- **Deflationary Asset**: Cryptocurrencies with decreasing supply (e.g., Ethereum when burn rates surpass daily issuance) lose value over time.  
- **Flippening**: A speculative theory where Ethereum (ETH) surpasses Bitcoin (BTC) in value, though it remains highly uncertain.  
- **Supply Caps**: Bitcoin has a fixed 21 million supply, while Ethereum’s supply is unbounded but managed through burn mechanisms.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Halving Schedule**: Bitcoin’s supply halving occurs every 210,000 blocks, reducing rewards by 50% annually.  
- **Burn Rate Calculation**: Ethereum burns 1,700 ETH daily (as per the 2021 EIP-1559 upgrade) to reduce circulation.  
- **Inflation Rate Target**: Bitcoin aims for 0% inflation by 2140, while Ethereum’s burn rate is monitored to determine deflationary status.  

### Related Topics  
- **Cryptocurrency Economics**: The document connects to broader discussions on supply dynamics, inflation, and market valuation.  
- **Digital Stores of Value**: The text references Bitcoin’s historical precedent as a store of value, contrasting with Ethereum’s focus on scalability and governance.  
- **Ethereum vs. Bitcoin**: The content ties to the comparison of their use cases, features, and investor strategies in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Bitcoin has the most predictable issuance schedule in cryptocurrency. To maintain scarcity, the number of Bitcoins that enter circulation drops by half every four years in an event called âthe halvening.â This pre-set reward reduction continues until there are 21 million BTC in circulation, and the goal is for Bitcoin to have a 0% inflation rate by the year 2140.

Ethereumâs ETH doesnât have a hard-cap supply, but that doesnât mean itâs an inflationary cryptocurrency. Following 2021âs âEIP-1559â upgrade, the Ethereum blockchain burns a percentage of ETH used to pay for fees on its network. âBurningâ cryptocurrency means deliberately wiping it out of existence. Whenever ETHâs burn rate rises above the average daily issuance of1,700 ETH per day, it becomes a deflationary asset.

The dissimilarities between BTC and ETH may be significant, but these cryptocurrencies still have a few commonalities. Here are some examples:

The âFlippeningâ is cryptocurrency slang. It describes the potential event when ETH âflipsâ BTC and becomes the worldâs most valuable cryptocurrency. Ethereum supporters sometimes argue ETH will have more value than BTC as ETH takes over Web3. Although the Flippening is a popular meme in cryptocurrency circles, itâs a highly speculative theory. At current prices, Ethereum would need todouble its market capitalizationto match BTCâs value.Â

Itâs impossible to say Bitcoin is âbetterâ than Ethereum, or vice versa. Both coins have unique use cases, features, and goals, making them distinct projects. Buying BTC versus ETH depends on an investorâs intentions and opinions of each cryptocurrency.

Both BTC and ETH have the potential to become digital stores of value assets. However, BTCâs longer history, higher liquidity, and hard-cap supply of 21 million make it a more conservative option. Even though BTC is volatile, its value doesnât typicallyfluctuate as much as altcoinslike ETH.
