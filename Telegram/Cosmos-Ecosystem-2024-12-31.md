## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. Let me start by going through each message to understand the context and main ideas.

First, there's a lot of New Year's greetings and resolutions. Users like SirNoShame, user_7164487109, IBCnoticer, and xxZeroKoolxx are wishing everyone a happy new year. Some mention sobriety, like TommiMoontana celebrating six months of sobriety and planning to stay sober. Others, like Ibreaktwo, are asking about eligibility for something, maybe an airdrop. 

Then there's a message from faneatiku about the 2025 roadmap for their project, which will be announced in the first two weeks. They also mention collaboration with Spheron Network for decentralized AI. That's a key point. 

The CoinhallBot provides price data for MOBIX and ATOM, showing market caps and price changes. The market cap for ATOM is $2.52B. The price for MOBIX is $0.051417. 

MissRose_bot is muting and kicking users for various reasons, like sharing links or discussing politics. For example, Hoko Morcus was muted for mentioning Trump, and J and Dayiro were kicked for "pengu." 

There's a discussion about crypto developments. cosmotick talks about FASB rule changes and potential impacts on crypto, mentioning MicroStrategy entering the S&P 500. Others discuss liquid staking ATOM, with SuperEra explaining the process and advising caution. 

Some messages are about raffles, like the 100 million dollar one. Also, there's a mention of a movie reference by TommiMoontana comparing himself to Benjamin Button. 

Other points include a possible Gno airdrop cancellation mentioned by kousignals, and users discussing transitioning or resolutions, like lostreply's "New year new me." 

I need to group these into categories: New Year celebrations, crypto updates, moderation actions, project announcements, and community discussions. Highlight the roadmap announcement, price data, moderation kicks/mutes, FASB changes, liquid staking info, and the raffle. Also note the humor and personal resolutions where relevant. 

Make sure to keep it concise, using bullet points or sections. Avoid minor details

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by going through each message to see what they're talking about.

First, there's a message from SirNoShame saying "Happy new year cunts". The user is using a bit of slang, but the main topic here seems to be New Year's Eve greetings, even if it's phrased roughly. Then another user mentions a New Year's Eve Raffle with 100 Million Dollars. That's clearly about a raffle event.

Next, PanzerFren shares a YouTube link. Without the context of the video, it's hard to say, but maybe the topic is the video itself or the artist, HardcoreSuperstarOfficial. Mistica191 expresses gratitude and love for meeting others in the chat, and wishes for a spectacular 2025. So that's positive sentiment and New Year wishes.

Serranoooooo welcomes GloriaZulay, so that's a welcome message. CoinhallBot provides data on MOBIX and Cosmos Hub Atom, which are cryptocurrency prices and market data. Iconoicono makes a comment about someone being born a genius but getting more retarded with age, which might relate to a person or a meme. IBCnoticer mentions being sober on New Year's Eve and reading about IBC tokens, so topics here are sobriety and technical crypto topics.

MissRose_bot has several messages about muting or kicking users for reasons like "bye" or "politics is for nerds", which relates to moderation. There's a mention of "pengu" in some kick reasons, which might be a specific term or reference in the community. 

TommiMoontana talks about sobriety, aging, and watching a movie, referencing Benjamin Button. Keyleu and kousignals discuss GNO airdrop cancellation and airdrops in general. BasementNodes mentions waiting for celebrations to cease and time-related messages. Arcmosis asks if Panda is back, which might be a community reference. 

Florian123321 and xxZeroKoolxx also send New Year greetings. Cosmotick's messages involve discussions about crypto market growth, FASB rules, MicroStrategy, SP500 index, and transitioning wallets. There's a mention of transitioning to a woman, which might relate to personal resolutions.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through each message carefully. The text is a series of chat messages from different users, mostly around New Year's Eve 2024.

First, looking for positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Positive messages usually have words like "happy," "love," "spectacular," emojis like ü•∞, üéâ, or expressions of hope and excitement. Negative ones might have insults, complaints, or negative emojis. Neutral could be factual statements or questions without clear emotion.

Starting with SirNoShame at 23:12: "Happy new year cunts" ‚Äì "cunts" is a derogatory term, so that's negative. Then user_7164487109 mentions a raffle with 100 million dollars, which sounds positive but it's a notification, so maybe neutral. PanzerFren shares a YouTube link; no sentiment there. Mistica191 says "Thank you!!!! I love meeting you here. Hope for a SPECTACULAR 2025 ü•∞" ‚Äì definitely positive with love and excitement. Serranoooooo welcomes someone with ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, so positive. CoinhallBot gives crypto data; neutral.

Iconoicono's message: "he is born as a genius and get more retarded as he age?" ‚Äì uses "retarded" which is negative. IBCnoticer says "Happy New Year... 2025 gonna be lit üî•" ‚Äì positive. Another IBCnoticer talks about being sober, reading about IBC tokens, and being happy; positive. MissRose_bot mutes someone for "bye" ‚Äì neutral, just an action. SirNoShame again says "No Chief Keef but I hate being sober" ‚Äì hate is negative. MissRose_bot says "watch tomorrow" ‚Äì neutral.

TommiMoontana references a movie and his own situation, "watching now on myself" ‚Äì maybe neutral or slightly positive if he's amused. Then he talks about sobriety and looking younger, which is positive. Keyleu's "if you gno you gno" ‚Äì neutral. Kousignals asks about airdrop cancellation ‚Äì negative if true. BasementNodes says "please cease celebrations" ‚Äì negative. Another message from them about "6 more hours" ‚Äì neutral.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any explicit or implicit tasks, decisions made, or steps that need to be taken.

Starting with the latest messages. SirNoShame's "Happy new year cunts" is probably just a greeting, no action needed. The raffle mentioned by user_7164487109 is a New Year's Eve Raffle for $100 million, but there's no specific action item here beyond announcing it. PanzerFren shared a YouTube link; unless there's a note to watch or analyze the video, maybe not an action item. Mistica191's message is a thank you and good wishes, nothing actionable. Serranoooooo welcomes someone, which is a social gesture, not an action.

CoinhallBot's messages are about cryptocurrency data, like MOBIX and ATOM prices. These are informational, not actions. Iconoicono's comment seems like a joke about someone being born a genius but getting worse, but no action here. IBCnoticer's happy new year messages are similar to others, just greetings.

MissRose_bot has several moderation actions: muting users for specific reasons. The muting itself is an action taken, but unless there's a next step required from others, maybe not. The message from faneatiku mentions a 2025 Roadmap to be announced in the first two weeks of the new year. That's a clear action item‚Äîannounce the roadmap. Also, inviting the community to share ideas, so the next step would be to collect those ideas.

Looking at cosmotick's messages: he talks about FASB rule changes and mentions MicroStrategy entering SP500, but these are observations, not actions. However, the part where he says "I highly recommend following the news" could be an action item for others to do so. But the user might be referring to decisions made by the group or individuals. 

Another message from faneatiku says the roadmap will be announced on getbze.com, so the action is to finalize and publish the roadmap. Also, the user mentions inviting ideas from the community, so that's a next step.

The user also mentions a message from wlkatja about a partnership between Warden
