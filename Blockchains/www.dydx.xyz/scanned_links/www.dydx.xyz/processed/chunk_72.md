- **Bullish Sentiment**: Increased public interest in cryptocurrencies when prices rise, often amplified by media coverage and advertising (e.g., Crypto.com’s naming rights purchase during a bull run).  
- **Trading Volume**: Measures the number of trades on exchanges, reflecting market activity and liquidity.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Moving Averages**: Examples include 50-day, 100-day, or 200-day periods to track median prices.  
- **Media Impact**: News outlets report on cryptocurrencies during price increases, fueling public interest and investor behavior.  
- **Advertising**: Cryptocurrency exchanges invest in advertising to capitalize on bullish sentiment, as seen with Crypto.com’s naming rights purchase.

- Technical chart patterns and trendlines:In finance, technical analysis focuses on chart patterns and historical trends to predict the future price trajectory for an asset class. For instance, analysts often examine trendlines called "moving averages" to confirm whether cryptocurrencies are in a bull market. A moving average traces a cryptocurrency's median price over a set period (e.g., the past 50 days, 100 days, or 200 days). When the average cost of a cryptocurrency is above multiple moving averages, it's likely in a bull market.Â
- More attention in mainstream media:News outlets are more likely to report on cryptocurrencies as prices increase, further fueling public interest in digital assets. It's also common for cryptocurrency companies to invest in advertising to capitalize on the pervasive bullish sentiment. For example, the exchangeCrypto.combought the naming rights for LAâs former Staples Center during the 2021 cryptocurrency bull run.Â
- Higher trading volume on exchanges:Volume measures how many times a cryptocurrency trades between buyers and sellers each day on an exchange.
