### Document Overview  
The content discusses Ethereum 2.0, a major upgrade that transitioned from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) to improve scalability, energy efficiency, and decentralization, with emphasis on its impact on the Web3 ecosystem.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: The previous consensus mechanism used for Ethereum before 2022.  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: The new consensus mechanism introduced in Ethereum 2.0 to reduce energy consumption and increase scalability.  
- **Merge**: The transition from PoW to PoS, which occurred in 2022 and restructured the blockchain’s architecture.  
- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Applications built on Ethereum’s blockchain using smart contracts, operating without centralized intermediaries.  
- **Consensus Layer**: The mechanism by which nodes agree on the validity of transactions and block structure.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Transition to PoS**: Ethereum 2.0 replaced PoW with PoS, where validators (nodes) stake their own Ether to authorize transactions and create blocks.  
- **Block Size and Speed**: The upgrade increased block size and speed, enabling higher transaction throughput and reduced latency.  
- **Validator Requirements**: Validators must hold a certain amount of ETH and stake it to participate in consensus, ensuring security and reducing the risk of 51% attacks.  
- **Smart Contracts**: The core functionality of Ethereum, now enhanced by the PoS mechanism to support scalability and efficiency.  

### Related Topics  
- **Ethereum Blockchain Overview**: The content connects to prior discussions about Ethereum’s role as a decentralized smart contract platform.  
- **Ethereum Upgrades**: The document references broader trends in blockchain evolution, such as upgrades and consensus mechanism changes.  
- **Web3 Ecosystem**: The impact of Ethereum 2.0 on decentralization, developer adoption, and user experience in the Web3 space.

wasnât the first successfulpeer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency. Instead of solely using blockchain networks to record P2P payments, the Ethereum team created a massive âglobal supercomputerâ with the potential to decentralize internet applications.

In September 2022, Ethereum evolved significantly by changing how computers on its blockchain reach consensus and post new transactions. The move was so groundbreaking that many in the crypto community believe the post-2022 âEthereum 2.0â has the potential to attract more developers, investors, and users into theWeb3 ecosystem.

Learn what Ethereum 2.0 is, how it differs from Ethereum, and how it has impacted the crypto community.

Before getting into Ethereum 2.0, letâs review what the Ethereum blockchain is.

Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has established itself as the dominant smart contract, decentralized crypto protocol. First introduced on Ethereum, smart contracts are blockchain-based programs that understand and execute pre-coded commands. Thanks to smart contract technologyâs decentralization, third-party developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereumâs blockchain. These dApps function similarly to current web-based applications (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) but without big tech companies, governments, or other centralized institutions behind them. Instead, dApps use smart contract code and the consensus layer of Ethereumâs main blockchain to provide users with a trustless, automated, and P2P online experience.

Ethereum has had many upgrades throughout its history, but Ethereum 2.0âwhich began with âthe Mergeâ in 2022âfundamentally changes the blockchainâs core consensus mechanism. Think of the consensus mechanism as a set of rules computers must follow to process transactions and record data. Earlier, Ethereum used a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin.
