**Original Text:**

Implemented in collaboration with sprinti, that approach enabled us to collect data from a wide
range of PUDO locations within the service areas. At each PUDO location, the observer manually recorded time measurements for stop
times. According to our definition of stop time, the measurement began when the vehicle came to a complete stop and ended just before it accelerated to resume the trip. We conducted these on-site observations over seven days spread across three months:
September (3 days), October (1 day), and November (3 days) of 2022. Each observation day
encompassed an entire eight-hour operating shift. The vehicle in which the observer was

permitted to ride was assigned by sprinti. Over the course of the seven observation days,
the observer accompanied different drivers in both vehicle classes.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining a specific aspect of a research study or project, likely focusing on urban transport systems and sustainability.

**Technical Details/Parameters:**

* The approach involves collecting data from a wide range of PUDO (Point-of-Purchase) locations within the service areas.
* The observer manually records time measurements for stop times using a technique defined by the authors' definition.
* The measurement begins when the vehicle comes to a complete stop and ends just before it accelerates to resume the trip.
* The study covers seven days, spread across three months (September, October, and November 2022), with each observation day encompassing an eight-hour operating shift.

**Contextual Connection:**

The chunk is connected to the surrounding context by referencing the "ride-pooling services" theme, which is discussed in the document's Key Themes and Topics section. The specific details mentioned (e.g., manual recording of stop times) are also relevant to this context.

**Requirements/Conditions/Constraints:**

* The study appears to be focused on implementing a data collection method for ride-pooling services.
* The use of simulation tools like MATSim is hinted at, but not explicitly stated as a requirement or constraint.
* The research project may have specific limitations or constraints related to the time period (September 2022- November 2022), which could affect the sample size and data availability.

The chunk does not raise any significant concerns or questions about the study's methodology or findings. However, if you were to ask follow-up questions like "What was the primary research question?" or "How did the study collect data?", it would be an important aspect of understanding the context and purpose of the project.
