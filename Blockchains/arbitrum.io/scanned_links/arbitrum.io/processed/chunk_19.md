personal information to any third parties affiliated with the Promotion or to the public in connection with conducting and administering the Promotion. For example, we may share personal information to select a winner, provide a prize, as required by applicable law (such as publishing a list of winners), or as permitted by the applicable terms and conditions or official rules of the Promotion.

We may share personal information if we believe that it is necessary to:comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or legitimate governmental request;protect the safety or security of the Services, users of the Services, or any person;investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities;prevent spam, abuse, fraud, or other malicious activity of actors using or accessing the Services; orprotect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use the Services.Non-public information about our users will not be released to law enforcement except in response to an appropriate legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal process that has been reviewed by Offchain Labs. However, if we receive information that provides us with a good faith belief that there is an exigent emergency, we may provide information to law enforcement trying to prevent or mitigate the danger, to be determined on a case-by-case basis.

We may share personal information with third parties we choose to acquire or with buyers, successors, or others in connection with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, financing due diligence, initial public offering, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets or transition of service to another provider, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation or similar proceeding, as permitted by law and/or contract.
