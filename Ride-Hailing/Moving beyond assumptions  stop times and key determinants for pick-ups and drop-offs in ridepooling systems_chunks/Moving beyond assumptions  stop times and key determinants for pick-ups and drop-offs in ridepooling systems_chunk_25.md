**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the technical details of a regression model used in transportation research, specifically focusing on the relationship between variables such as the presence of bulky baggage and an individual's age (Senior) in a ride-pooling service.

The context of this chunk is part of a larger discussion about urban transport systems and sustainability, highlighting various studies and findings related to ride-pooling services. The specific references provided demonstrate ongoing research in this field, covering topics such as simulation studies, disparities in travel times for accessing non-work destinations, technological aspects (e.g., autonomous vehicles), and the impact of shared mobility on reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions.

The technical details described in this chunk include:

* The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) with a value greater than 0.35 and p < 0.001, indicating a moderate but significant correlation between the presence of bulky baggage and an individual's age.
* The description of variables considered in the regression models, including:
	+ Sprinter: A type of vehicle used for shared mobility services.
	+ Virtual: A virtual platform used for ride-pooling services.
	+ Senior: An individual's age category (0-60 years).
