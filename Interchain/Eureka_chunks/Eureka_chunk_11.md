## Eureka - Chunk 11

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Changes are as follows:

eureka_transfer Operation type to be expected to be returned from the /route and /msgs_direct endpoints
eureka_transfer Transfer type to be expected to be returned from the /status endpoint in the transfer sequence
eureka bridge type returned from the /bridges endpoint
To keep Eureka opt-in, integrators must pass eureka into the experimental_features array in the /route and /msgs_direct calls to enable Eureka routing
What this looks like for each type of Skip Go integration:

If you’re using the Widget, make sure you’re updated to version 3.5.0 or above and pass in eureka to the experimentalFeatures prop. If you’re using the Client Library, make sure you’re updated to version 0.16.22 or above and pass in eureka to the experimentalFeatures param. If you’re integrated directly with the REST endpoints, you can find the relevant types in the API reference for the Route Operation and for the Lifecycle Tracking Transfer.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the provided text chunk:

**1. Technical details:**
The text describes four specific protocols involved in cross-chain asset transfers:
- Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)
- Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)
- Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)
- Hyperlane
Each protocol has potential failure points, such as timeouts or slippage, and post-swap failures, including tokens being sent back to the source chain.

**2. Connection to surrounding context:**
The text builds upon the previous document's discussion of cross-chain asset transfer protocols, providing additional insights into the technical details and potential risks associated with these protocols.

**3. Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

- Users must pass eureka to the experimentalFeatures prop in the /route and /msgs_direct calls to enable Eureka routing.
- Integrators must be updated to version 3.5.0 or above for the Widget (using eureka) and versions 0.16.22 or above for the Client Library (using eureka).
- The relevant types can be found in the API reference for the Route Operation and Lifecycle Tracking Transfer.

**Analysis of connection to surrounding context:**

The text provides a detailed overview of potential failure points, which is critical for ensuring secure and reliable cross-chain asset transfers. By understanding these risks, developers and users can take necessary precautions to mitigate them. The text also highlights specific technical requirements, such as passing eureka to enable Eureka routing, and updates for different libraries (Widget vs. Client Library), demonstrating a clear effort to provide context for developers.

**Recommendations:**

The recommendations section provides actionable advice for improving security and reliability in cross-chain asset transfers. Specifically:

1. User education is recommended to inform users about potential failure points.
2. Risk management is suggested, encouraging users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. Developer best practices are emphasized, highlighting the importance of implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.

Overall, this text chunk provides a comprehensive overview of cross-chain asset transfer protocols, including technical details, potential failure points, and specific requirements for developers and users.
