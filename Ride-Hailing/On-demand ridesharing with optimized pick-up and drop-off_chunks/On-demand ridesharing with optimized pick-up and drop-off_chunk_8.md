**Original Text:**

The remaining of this section explains in detail how walking might enhance mobility systems in
general, emphasizing the potential improvements on ridesharing systems, and synthesizes previous papers that deal with similar ideas;
Section 2 explains the algorithm that matches groups of requests (with optimized PUDO points) together and with the available veÂ­
hicles, describes its complexity and proposes heuristics that permit running it over large instances; Section 3 shows the results over a
simple network and a real dataset in Manhattan; finally, Section 4 concludes and proposes some ideas for future research. 1.1. Motivation: the role of walking in mobility systems
Most mobility systems that do not rely on private ownership of a vehicle require their users to walk. This is particularly clear in
public transport, where passengers are collected in predefined stops or stations for the pick-up and the drop-off. Three main reasons
explain why this is convenient.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk primarily focuses on the potential benefits of walking as a mobility system, specifically how it can enhance ridesharing systems.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The term "PUDO points" refers to Parking Validation Points or Stops, which are designated areas where passengers pick up their vehicles. These points help match groups of requests with available vehicles.
* The algorithm described in this chunk is likely using a combination of routing algorithms (e.g., Google Maps), data structures (e.g., graph databases), and possibly machine learning techniques to optimize the matching process.

**Context:**

This text chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Reiterating the importance of walking as a mobility system, highlighting its convenience in public transport.
* Introducing the concept of PUDO points, which is crucial for matching groups of requests with available vehicles.
* Explaining that this concept is relevant to ridesharing systems, where passengers often rely on pre-defined stops or stations.

**Requirements, Conditions, and Constraints:**

* The algorithm described requires:
	+ Availability of a routing system (e.g., Google Maps) to estimate travel times and costs between requests and available vehicles.
	+ Data about parking validation points or stops (PUDO points).
	+ Machine learning algorithms to optimize the matching process.
* The context is limited by:
	+ The scope of ridesharing systems, which typically do not rely on private ownership of a vehicle.
