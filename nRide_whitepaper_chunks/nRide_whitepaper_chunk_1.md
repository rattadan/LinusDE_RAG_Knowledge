ABSTRACT
The nRide protocol is a community-owned effort to create a more open and equitable ride-hailing ecosystem. Traditional ride-hailing applications are often plagued by
high fees, a lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns. To address these issues,
nRide has developed a peer-to-peer ride-hailing protocol that connects riders and drivers
directly, without intermediaries. This protocol includes a messaging system, an escrow
mechanism, and a driver registry, all of which are built on top of the NKN network and
the JUNO blockchain. The nRide protocol is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and is powered by the NRIDE token, which provides access to the
platform and allows holders to participate in the growth and direction of the project.
