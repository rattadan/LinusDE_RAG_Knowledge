**Original Text:**

The
comparison of the first two scenarios suggests that allowing walks has a larger impact when the fleet is smaller (and the quality of
service is worse): while usersâ€™ costs are reduced in about 30% in both scenarios, the reduction of VHT is larger in the second one. As discussed above, a central aspect of the optimization of PUDO points is the possible increase in computational times. In our
simulations, the experiments that include walking take approximately ten times longer (from about one hour per iteration to ten
hours). Nevertheless, in both cases, a centralized calculation is too slow, but a distributed one is fast enough. In fact, each vehicle can
determine which trips it might serve: in the case we are studying, this would reduce the computational time required to compute the
GV-graph by thousands (because the fleet sizes are 2,000 or 3,000 in the different scenarios). Admitting walks increases the number of
edges in the GV-Graph (i.e. the number of feasible trips) from about 6,000 to 40,000.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides a detailed analysis of two scenarios related to ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems:

1. **Technical Details:** The first scenario compares the impact of allowing walks in both smaller (fleets are 2,000) and larger fleets (fleets are 3,000), evaluating how it affects user costs. In both cases, the reduction in VHT is greater when walks are allowed.
2. **Contextual Connection:** This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by discussing key themes related to ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems. The comparison of the two scenarios serves as a case study for understanding the impact of walking on ride-sharing systems.
3. **Specific Requirements and Conditions:**
 
The required computational time is significant, with simulations showing that allowing walks can reduce it tenfold compared to not having any walking (hence, the need for distributed calculations). This highlights the challenges associated with incorporating new features or behaviors into existing systems without compromising performance.

Key points:

* Allowing walks in smaller fleets increases user costs but reduces VHT.
* In larger fleets, allowing walks has a greater impact on user cost and reduced VHT.
* Computational time is significant when walking is allowed, requiring distributed calculations.
