## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to go through each message and see what's important.

Starting from the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's a standard help message, so maybe note that as a recurring reminder. Then kychuli says "Crystals balls all outta juice" and "Nobody knows the answer to that :(" which seems like they're frustrated about not having a clear answer. 

nllmnzlln asks about a prediction for Osmosis increasing by a percentage. The previous messages from kychuli respond to that, indicating uncertainty. So the key point here is someone asking for a prediction, and others saying they don't know.

Further down, itsmeartc and others are talking about banning users. They mention using commands like /ban and discussing methods to handle bot raids. Khuwarzmi mentions activating kickall but the raid stopped. BasementNodes says they stopped trying to remove all bots because it's constant. So the main issue here is bot raids, and the decisions are about handling bans either by individual removal or bulk nuking later. Also, there's a mention of using Cosmobot for banning, which might be a tool they're considering.

WorkerBee_3 talks about getting used to app techniques, which is a positive note on adaptation. User_7164487109 greets everyone. 

Putting it all together, the key points are the bot raid problem, the discussion on banning methods (individual vs bulk), the mention of using Cosmobot, and the support link. The decisions involve the strategies users are considering or already using to manage the bots. The greeting and the WorkerBee's comment are less critical but might be worth a brief mention if they add context. The crystal ball comments are metaphorical, indicating uncertainty about predictions. Need to make sure the summary captures the main issue and the proposed solutions without getting bogged down in details.

**Summary:**  
The chat discusses ongoing bot raids on Osmosis, with users noting frequent bot account joins (e.g., "every 5 minutes") and challenges in managing them. BasementNodes mentions giving up on removing all bots due to their persistence, while Khuwarzmi suggests using Cosmobot for bulk bans or

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key themes or topics are.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a link to the support site. So that's about Support Resources. Then kychuli's message about "Crystals balls all outta juice" ‚Äì maybe that's a metaphor for something being depleted or not working, so maybe Technical Issues or Resource Depletion. The next message from kychuli says nobody knows the answer, which could relate to Uncertainty or Lack of Information.

nllmnzlln is asking about a prediction for Osmosis increasing by a percentage. That's definitely about Predictions or Percentage Increase. The next osmosis_statbot message is the same support link again, so Support Resources is already covered. 

itsmeartc's messages talk about banning users, specifically with "/ban user1, user2, user3" and issues with doing it with Rose. So that's related to User Management or Ban Requests. Then Khuwarzmi mentions Cosmobot and possible solutions, which might be Alternative Solutions or Tools. 

Khuwarzmi also talks about activating kickall but the raid stopped, and BasementNodes mentions bot accounts joining every 5 minutes, so Bot Raids or Account Management is a topic. BasementNodes also says they stopped trying to remove all bots, indicating Persistent Bot Issues or Daily Challenges. 

WorkerBee_3 mentions getting used to app techniques, so App Usage Techniques or User Adaptation. User_7164487109's greeting is just a greeting, maybe not a topic unless the main theme is Welcoming Messages, but that might not be necessary here.

Putting it all together, the main topics seem to be Support Resources, Technical Issues (like the crystals balls), Predictions (percentage increase), User Management/Ban Requests, Bot Raids, Persistent Bot Issues, and App Usage Techniques. I should check if any of these can be merged or if some are more specific. For example, "User Management" and "Ban Requests" might be under the same topic. Also, "Bot Raids" and "Persistent Bot Issues" could be grouped as Bot Activity Challenges. The greeting might not be a main topic since it's just a single message. So

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Then, I'll figure out the overall sentiment of the entire conversation.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a link to the support site. That's just providing help, so probably neutral.

Next, kychuli says "Crystals balls all outta juice" and "Nobody knows the answer to that :(". Both seem a bit negative. The first is a metaphor implying they can't predict things, and the second shows frustration or disappointment. So those are negative.

Then nllmnzlln asks if anyone knows the prediction for Osmosis increasing by a percentage. The question itself is neutral, but since they're asking for a prediction which might be uncertain, but the message doesn't have negative words. So neutral.

Another osmosis_statbot message, same as the first one, so neutral again.

itsmeartc has several messages. They mention needing to ban users one by one, can't do it with Rose, and commands like "/ban user1, user2, user3". These are about dealing with bots or moderation issues. The frustration here is negative. Also, "can not do it with Rose" might indicate a problem with a tool or method, adding to negative sentiment.

Khuwarzmi says "With cosmobot it's possible i think" and "ser can you?" which are neutral or slightly positive if they're suggesting a solution. But since they're discussing possible tools, maybe neutral.

BasementNodes talks about bot accounts joining every 5 minutes, stopping removal efforts, and it happening all day. This shows frustration and helplessness, so negative. The message about adding them to a list and nuking them later also indicates annoyance, so negative.

Khuwarzmi again mentions accounts joining and a bot raid. "Bot raid" is a negative event, so those messages are negative.

BasementNodes says "The realest name I ever did see" ‚Äì that could be sarcasm or genuine. Without context, maybe neutral, but if it's sarcastic, it might be negative. Hmm, tricky. Maybe neutral unless there's a clear tone.

WorkerBee_3 says getting used to the app's techniques. That's positive because they're adapting and becoming accustomed, so positive.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and see if any of them indicate something that needs to be done, a decision made, or a next step.

Starting from the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's more of an informational message, so probably not an action item. Then kychuli mentions crystal balls being out of juice and that nobody knows the answer. Those are just comments, no actions here.

Next, nllmnzlln asks about a prediction for Osmosis increasing by a percentage. The others respond that nobody knows, so that's a question without a decision. Then osmosis_statbot again sends the support link. 

Looking at itsmeartc's messages: "need to ban 1 by 1", "can not do it with Rose", and "/ban user1, user2, user3,". These seem like action items. They're trying to ban users but facing issues with a tool called Rose. The mention of activating kickall by Khuwarzmi and BasementNodes talking about adding users to a list and nuking them at day's end also indicate actions related to banning bots. 

Khuwarzmi mentions activating kickall but the raid stopped, which might be a decision or a next step. BasementNodes talks about bot accounts joining every 5 minutes and stopping attempts to remove all, which is more of a status update. 

WorkerBee_3 says they'll get used to the app's techniques, which is a general statement. The last message is a greeting, so no action there.

Putting it all together, the main actions are related to banning bot accounts. The users are discussing methods to handle bot raids, like using kickall, manually banning one by one, or compiling a list to ban all at once. The decisions here would be the methods they choose to implement. Next steps might involve coordinating these bans or addressing the tool limitations they mentioned with Rose.

I should list these points clearly, making sure to note who is involved and the specific actions. Also, check if any deadlines or timeframes are mentioned, but I don't see any. Highlight the challenges they're facing with the current tools and their strategies to combat the bot influx.
