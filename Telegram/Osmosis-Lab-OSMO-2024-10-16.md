## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different users on Osmosis. Let me go through each message and pick out the important stuff.

First, Mikebarb mentions that after IBC is enabled, they'll add something, but it's not clear if that's happened yet. Then Anas6992 asks if Osmosis will add MANTRA. I need to note that as a question about future token integration.

Next, Popeblack shares a link. Not sure what that's about, maybe a social media post. Then Osmogovbot quotes Raphael about a pool that was removed without a governance vote. Raphael is upset because the pool creation fee was charged and he wants the decision reversed. So key point here is a governance issue with pool removal.

Mikebarb and Dharmil discuss fees for loading USDC into the Osmosis card. Dharmil is confused whether the fee is for loading crypto or selling to fiat. Mikebarb says it's just gas fees. So the fee structure is a point of confusion here.

Another user, user_1221491085, asks for Osmosis videos related to "surgery," but Mikebarb clarifies that Osmosis is a crypto blockchain. Maybe a misunderstanding there.

User_2138087871 reports a problem with TFM, an open order missing, and the URL being down. Mikebarb and Jasbanza mention Jason created an app to cancel TFM orders. So TFM issues and a tool to handle them.

Vladosdao and Sirwenalot talk about Quasar vaults and dynamic LP tokens. Vladosdao says funds are still in the vault, governed by a multisig with a Quasar member. So status update on user funds in Quasar.

User_319582897 is having trouble connecting their Ledger via Kepler on mobile. They tried pay.osmosis.zone but it's not working. Jabanza suggests clearing cache. Technical support issue here.

Osmosis_statbot has safety announcements: don't share seed phrases, block DMs, use verified links, install Keplr from official site, use hardware wallets, check transactions. Important security guidelines.

GPKwee and others mention Osmosis Pay's

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated list. The text is a series of chat messages from different users discussing various aspects related to Osmosis, which is a cryptocurrency blockchain.

First, I need to go through each message and identify the key topics being discussed. Let me start by reading each line carefully.

The first message from mikebarb talks about IBC being enabled and whether that's happened yet. So IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) is a topic here.

Anas6992 asks if Osmosis will add MANTRA. MANTRA is likely a token or project name, so adding MANTRA to Osmosis is a topic.

Popeblack shares a link to a Twitter post, but without context, it's hard to tell the topic. Maybe not a main topic unless referenced elsewhere.

osmogovbot mentions a pool (Pool 2159) that was removed by "higher-ups" without governance. So pool removal and governance issues are topics here.

mikebarb mentions a 0.5% fee for converting USDC to USD. That's about transaction fees, specifically forex or conversion fees.

dharmil is asking about fees to load USDC into the Osmosis card, and there's a link to a Notion page about supported tokens and forex fees. So Osmosis card fees and supported tokens are topics.

mikebarb and dharmil continue discussing Osmosis card fees, gas fees, and converting crypto to fiat. So the Osmosis card itself, gas fees, and crypto-to-fiat conversion are relevant.

Another user mentions issues with the Osmosis card application process, suggesting simplification. So application process for the Osmosis card is a topic.

jasbanza and others discuss connecting via Ledger and Kepler Mobile, with issues on mobile. So wallet integration (Keplr, Ledger) and mobile support for the card application are topics.

There's a public safety announcement from osmosis_statbot about avoiding scams, seed phrases, and using official links. Security practices and scam warnings are important here.

Sirwenalot asks about funds in Osmosis LP governed by Quasar. Quasar vaults and LP (liquidity provider) tokens are topics.

vladosdao mentions ATOM in stATOM vault and multisig governance. So stATOM and multisig governance

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from Osmosis and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. First, I need to go through each message and figure out the sentiment for each, then see the overall trend.

Starting with the latest messages. The user_319582897 is asking about connecting a Ledger on mobile. Mikebarb says probably not available for mobile yet. That seems neutral, just an info response. Then there's a safety announcement from osmosis_statbot, which is neutral as it's informative.

Looking at Sirwenalot's questions about funds in Quasar vaults. Vladosdao responds that they're still there and governed by a multisig. That's neutral, providing information. Then user_319582897 is having trouble with the Kepler + Ledger option not reacting. Jasbanza suggests clearing cache. Technical issues here, but the user is seeking help, so maybe neutral. 

The previous messages about TFM orders and a URL being down‚Äîuser_2138087871 is concerned, and mikebarb checks the site. This could be slightly negative due to the problem mentioned. 

Then there's a discussion about fees for converting USDC to USD, which is a cost concern. Dharmil asks about fees, mikebarb mentions gas fees. That's neutral. Anas6992 asks if Osmosis will add MANTRA, and mikebarb says after IBC is enabled. Neutral again.

The earliest message from Raphael about a pool being removed without governance. That's a complaint, so definitely negative. Others are discussing token migrations, which might be neutral or slightly positive if it's about improvements.

Looking at the positive ones: martyvb praises Osmosis Pay, mentions smooth process and saving fees. Definitely positive. Rekt_Zerker agrees. GPKwee mentions metal cards from Cypher and Osmium, which could be positive as they're premium features.

Negative sentiments are Raphael's complaint, user_2138087871's issue with TFM URL, and maybe the fee concerns. Neutral is most of the rest‚Äîtechnical questions, support responses, info sharing.

Now, how many of each? Let's count. Negative: Raphael's message, user_2138

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. Let me start by reading through each message carefully.

First, looking at the user_319582897 messages. They're having trouble connecting their Ledger to the Osmosis card site on mobile. Jason (jasbanza) suggests clearing the cache with CTRL+SHIFT+R, but the user is on mobile. So maybe there's an action item here for Jason to assist further or check if the application works on mobile. Also, the user mentions the Kepler Mobile app, so maybe checking compatibility there.

Then, dharmil asks about fees for loading USDC into the Osmosis card. Mikebarb says it's just gas fees, but dharmil is confused whether it's for loading crypto onto the card or selling to fiat. So there's a need to clarify the fee structure, maybe a next step for someone to provide more details.

Anas6992 asks if Osmosis will add MANTRA. Mikebarb responds that they will after IBC is enabled, but he's unsure if it's happened yet. So the action item here is to check if IBC has been enabled for MANTRA.

The message from Raphael via osmogovbot mentions a pool was removed without a governance vote. The decision here is that there's a request to reverse that decision, so next steps might involve the team addressing this issue or an investigation.

Sirwenalot asks about funds in Quasar vaults. Vladosdao explains that ATOM in stATOM vault is still there and governed by a multisig. So maybe next steps involve confirming the status of other tokens or providing more info to users.

User_319582897 also wants to apply for the card via mobile. Jason says probably not available for mobile yet, so maybe a next step is to check mobile compatibility or inform users about it.

Another user mentions a surgery comment, but Mikebarb says they're in the wrong Osmosis. Not relevant here.

Also, Jason created an app to cancel TFM orders. The user_2138... had an order issue and the URL is down. So next steps for Jason might be to check on TFM's status or assist with the order.

The statbot messages are general support links, so maybe not action items unless there's a need to update
