This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

The registry is implemented as a decentralized database using blockchain technology, allowing for secure and transparent storage of driver information. Each driver entry includes their
NKN address and an arbitrary location field that can be used to represent their location information in any
format, giving maximum flexibility to nRide applications and users. In addition to the location field, driver
entries also contain signed certificates indicating their affiliation with specific ride-hailing applications or
entities. Drivers can update their location and certificate information on the registry as they move around or
change affiliations, allowing riders to easily find nearby drivers and make informed choices about who to
ride with. Regarding the location field, nRide is working on a Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index, which is one
proposed standardized method for representing location information that provides a high level of precision
while maintaining data privacy.
