5. Evaluation of the author's character

Let me examine each tweet:

Putting these tweets in bigger context:

It serves as a communications channel to promote EU transport policies, highlight achievements in sustainability, and engage with the aviation sector.

I'll now generate 5 matching keywords/tags for postprocessing:
