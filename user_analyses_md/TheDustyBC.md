Putting some tweets in context of intentions:
The frequent use of "BREAKING" with information that's often not actually breaking news suggests the author is trying to create urgency and attract attention to their content. This likely aims to build followers and establish credibility as a market analyst.

The ETF flow analysis tweets show the author is trying to position themselves as someone who understands macro market forces and institutional adoption trends.

The more casual tweets like "GN EVERYONE" with the "touch grass" message show an attempt to connect with followers on a personal level and create a sense of community.

Let me compile these observations into a concise summary.

The ETF flow analysis and whale alerts aim to position the account as a go-to source for institutional crypto adoption trends. Casual, lifestyle-oriented tweets ("GN EVERYONE") help humanize the feed and build community rapport.
