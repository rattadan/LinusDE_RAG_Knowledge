## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and figure out the key points. The conversation starts with John1973 having trouble with the support site, showing an hourglass. Mikebarb suggests trying another device and checking support.osmosis.zone. Then there's a mention of scammers, so John1973 doesn't want DMs.

Tomisnow talks about stats on the website and introduces Pulse by Smart Stake, which is an AI-powered analytics tool. Osmosis_statbot provides the official support link. Fardinss86 is concerned about the OSMO price, suggesting it should stay above $0.23 to avoid traders fading it, based on some X posts and technical analysis.

So the main issues are: John's problem with the support site loading, the advice to avoid DMs due to scammers, the introduction of Pulse for analytics, and Fardinss86's price concern. Decisions include checking the correct support site and considering the price point. I need to keep this concise, focusing on those key points without extra details.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. So the user provided a series of chat messages and wants the main topics as a comma-separated list. 

First, I need to go through each message and identify what the key points are. Let's start with the earliest messages. 

The first message from Fardinss86 talks about the OSMO price, traders fading it, and suggests buying over $0.23 USD. That seems like a topic related to cryptocurrency price analysis and maybe market trends.

Then there's a message from tomisnow mentioning a stats tab on the website for holders. That's about blockchain analytics or statistics for token holders. 

mikebarb and John1973 are discussing issues with the support site, like a spinning clock or hourglass, not working. So that's technical issues with the support website or user experience problems. 

John1973 also mentions scammers DMing him, so there's a concern about scams and direct messages. 

Another part is tomisnow introducing Pulse by Smart Stake, which is AI-powered weekly analytics. That's a new service or tool announcement related to blockchain analytics. 

There's a link shared to analytics.smartstake.io/osmosis, which might be related to blockchain analytics platforms. 

The user_857217097 asks about account and holder information, so that's about user data or account details on Osmosis. 

Mrtiahou and others mention links and support functions, so maybe the main topics are around accessing support, website functionality, and scam warnings. 

Also, the support site support.osmosis.zone is mentioned multiple times, indicating issues with accessing or using it. 

Putting this all together, the main topics would be:

- OSMO price analysis and market trends
- Technical issues with the support website (spinning clock/hourglass)
- Scam warnings related to direct messages
- Blockchain analytics and statistics for Osmosis holders
- Introduction of Pulse by Smart Stake (AI-powered analytics)
- User account and holder information inquiries
- Support site accessibility and functionality concerns

I need to make sure these are concise and cover all the key points without overlapping. Maybe combine some related ones. For example, the support site issues and the hourglass loading could be under one topic. Also, the Pulse announcement and the analytics link might be part of the same

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a series of chat messages and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. I need to go through each message and figure out the sentiment, then determine the overall.

Starting from the top, the first message is from mikebarb asking if someone can DM him but saying they prefer not to if avoidable. That seems neutral; it's a suggestion without clear positive or negative emotion. Then John1973 mentions scammers DMing him and pleads not to do it. That's negative because he's annoyed by scammers.

Next, John1973 talks about a spinning clock loading, which indicates frustration with a technical issue‚Äînegative. Mikebarb responds, saying it's weird and they're getting tickets, asking if there's an issue now. Neutral, as it's a factual question. John1973 again says "Still doesn‚Äôt work," which is negative.

Then tomisnow mentions the website has stats for holders, suggesting checking the stats tab. That's neutral or maybe positive if helpful. Mikebarb confirms the support site and says it worked for him, asking to try again. Neutral-positive, encouraging but also a problem. John1973 replies with hourglass showing, which is a loading issue‚Äînegative. Another "Doesn‚Äôt seem to work" from John1973‚Äînegative.

Mikebarb asks if there's trouble opening a ticket, neutral. John1973 questions if the support function is still working, which is negative. User_857217097 asks about account info, neutral. Davidjgoosey says "very cool!!" which is positive. Tomisnow shares a link to analytics, neutral but maybe informative.

Mrtiahou asks for a link, neutral. Tomisnow introduces Pulse by Smart Stake with AI insights. This sounds positive as it's promoting a new feature. Osmosis_statbot shares the support link, neutral. Fardinss86 starts with "This is serious," which is negative. Then he urges the community to look into the matter quickly, negative urgency. Finally, he talks about OSMO price concerns, suggesting traders are fading the token and advising buying above 0.23 USD. This is negative as it's a concern about the price and community issues.

Now, tallying up. Negative

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. Let me start by reading through all the messages carefully.

First, there's a message from mikebarb saying, "You can dm me if you like. We don't like to if we can avoid it." Then John1973 mentions scammers DMing him and asks not to. So maybe there's a decision here about avoiding DMs unless necessary. But the user is asking for action items, so maybe the next step is to use the support site instead of DMs.

Next, mikebarb suggests trying another device and checking support.osmosis.zone. That's a clear action item: try another device and visit the support site. John1973 is having issues with the website loading, just showing a spinning clock. So the problem is accessing the support site. mikebarb confirms it's working for them, so the next step for John is to try again, possibly on another device.

Then there's a conversation where tomisnow mentions the stats tab on the website. user_857217097 asks about account info, and tomisnow directs them to the stats tab. So the action item here is to check the stats tab for holder information.

Another part: osmosis_statbot provides a link to the official support site. Fardinss86 is talking about the OSMO price and traders fading it below $0.23, suggesting buying above that. But this seems more like a discussion about market strategy rather than an action item from the chat. However, if the user is part of the community, maybe they should monitor the price and community discussions.

Putting it all together, the main action items are:

1. mikebarb advising John1973 to try another device and ensure they're on the correct support site.
2. John1973 needs to try accessing the support site again, possibly on a different device.
3. tomisnow directing user_857217097 to check the stats tab for holder stats.
4. Fardinss86 urging the community to look into the OSMO price matter, so maybe someone should address that concern.
5. The Statbot reminder to use the official support site.

Wait, but Fardinss86's messages are about the price and traders, but unless
