**Original Text:**

Utilising simulation
models, planners and researchers can better anticipate how ridepooling will integrate into
and affect existing traffic systems, an essential step for informed and effective future traffic
planning. Under these circumstances, this study addresses the identified research gap regarding
ridepooling stop times for PUDO activities and answers the following research questions:
• What is the typical duration of a ridepooling PUDO event? • What are the key determinants influencing the stop time of ridepooling PUDO events? • How are ridepooling stop times distributed, and how can these distributions be
described? TRANSPORTMETRICA A: TRANSPORT SCIENCE

Aiming to provide reliable stop time data and identify the influencing determinants, we
established an empirical study in collaboration with a PT-integrated ridepooling provider
in Germany.
