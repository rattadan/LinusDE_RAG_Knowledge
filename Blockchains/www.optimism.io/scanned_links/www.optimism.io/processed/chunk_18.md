- You are responsible for your own compliance.We attempt to comply with applicable laws, rules, and contractual obligations with respect to all of our Software, Content, and Activities. However, that landscape is constantly changing and differs jurisdiction by jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to conduct your own inquiry to ensure that your activity on OP Mainnet and any Other OP Chain/Fork complies with all applicable laws, rules, and contractual obligations.
- When we talk about future ideas or prospects, we are expressing our vision and hopes, and there is no commitment or guarantee that it will come true, that we will implement any of it, or that it will work.The world changes quickly and technology at an even faster pace. We have no idea how things will turn out and our aspirations and predictions may be unreliable. Look carefully at the date of things because after that date, things might have changed (a lot).
- You should not rely on us for any specific future work.The Foundation aims to make technical and governance contributions that allow the Foundation to further and progressively decentralize its role over time. We happily contribute to the Optimism community today, but we are also proud to pursue a world where this community does not need us in order for it to continue to thrive tomorrow. Thats the whole point of a public, open source, blockchain-based system governed by a decentralized Collective.
