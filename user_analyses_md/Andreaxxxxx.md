   - "SOAR" and "TIA" appear to be specific cryptocurrency projects, with TIA being a well-known token (Celestia)
   - The messages don't contain obvious red flags of scams, but they also don't provide verification of authenticity
   - The name "CosmosAirdrops" suggests this might be related to the Cosmos ecosystem, which is legitimate

4. Ecosystem/project advertised:
   - The channel name suggests it may be related to Cosmos ecosystem
   - SOAR appears to be a project that had an airdrop
   - TIA refers to Celestia, a blockchain project
   - There's no direct advertising of projects in these specific messages, but the channel itself seems focused on airdrops in the Cosmos ecosystem

5. Author evaluation:

   - Shows curiosity about airdrops and asks specific questions
   - Has a friendly tone ("Hello guys")
   - Appears to be seeking information rather than promoting something
