### Document Overview  
The content discusses Cardano's native cryptocurrency ADA, its role in the blockchain, staking mechanics, gas fees, and its use in decentralized applications (dApps) and marketplaces.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **ADA (Cardano’s native cryptocurrency)**: The blockchain’s native token, used for transactions, staking, and governance.  
- **Stake pools**: Validator nodes lock ADA to secure the blockchain and earn rewards.  
- **Gas fees (Plutus Platform)**: Transaction costs paid by users, allocated to staking pools or the Treasury.  
- **On-chain governance**: Validators use ADA as "votes" for protocol upgrades.  
- **Computation Layer**: Separation of smart contracts (Plutus) from the blockchain to optimize security and efficiency.  
- **Plutus Platform**: Cardano’s smart contract language for dApp development.  
- **On-chain governance proposals**: Proposals for protocol changes voted on by validators.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Staking mechanics**: Validators lock ADA in stake pools to secure the network and earn rewards.  
- **Gas fee allocation**: Users pay for transactions, with fees either going to staking pools or Cardano’s Treasury.  
- **Average transaction cost**: Typically below $0.50, though fluctuates based on network demand.  
- **DEX and CEX integration**: ADA is traded on platforms like Coinbase, Gemini, and Robinhood, with aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko listing exchange data.  

### Related Topics  
- **Cardano’s Computation Layer**: Connected to the Plutus smart contract framework discussed in the text.  
- **On-chain governance**: Linked to validator voting mechanisms and protocol upgrades.  
- **Crypto marketplaces**: Connected to the mention of ADA trading on centralized exchanges and DEXes.

the Computation Layer helps developers build dApps with smart contracts on Cardano'sPlutus Platform. By separating these two, Cardano hopes to optimize its core blockchain's security and efficiency while offering programmers greater flexibility to build decentralized projects.Â

Named after the pioneering computer scientist Ada Lovelace, ADA is the Cardano blockchain's native cryptocurrency. Cardano validator nodes lock ADA in "stake pools" on the blockchain to secure the protocol and broadcast new transaction data on Cardano's payment ledger. The more ADA there is in a stake pool, the more likely Cardano's algorithm will select it to confirm transactions and receive crypto rewards paid in ADA. Cardano's validators also have the option to use their ADA as "votes" on proposed upgrades from the developer community in on-chain governance proposals.

Cardano charges network fees (aka gas fees) for every transaction on its blockchain to compensate the ADA staking community. The ADA coins users pay for gas on the Cardano blockchain either goes to the stake pools or Cardano's Treasury. Although Cardanoâs gas fees fluctuate depending on network demand and protocol changes, the average cost per transaction istypically below $0.50.Â

People also use ADA to access services such as decentralized trading on Cardano-based dApps or to buy digital collectibles like Cardano NFTs. Plus, ADA has become an actively traded crypto asset on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and DEXs because of Cardanoâs popularity.Â

Dozens of CEXsââsuch as Coinbase and Geminiââoffer ADA trading services. Even a few stock trading platforms like Robinhood offer ADA coins to traders. To find a complete list of brokers selling ADA, visit a crypto price aggregator's website, such asCoinMarketCaporCoinGecko, and search for "Cardano." On the aggregatorâs Cardano price page, click the "Markets" tab to see the exchanges selling the ADA cryptocurrency.Â
