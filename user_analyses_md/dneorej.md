Contextualizing this tweet within the author's intentions:
This tweet appears to be part of a regular update series where the author (and likely team member of PersistenceOne) shares weekly goals and progress with their community. The use of "we" suggests they're part of a team, and the focus on marketing strategy indicates they likely have responsibility in that area. The casual tone with emojis and the Bitcoin symbol shows they're trying to connect with the crypto community in an approachable way while still conveying professional updates about their project.
