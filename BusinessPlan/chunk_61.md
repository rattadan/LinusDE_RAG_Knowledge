## Chunk 61

**Original Text:**

6. Monitoring: Once the proposal has been implemented, it is crucial to monitor the nRide network
to ensure that the changes have had the desired effect and that there are no unintended
consequences. This may involve ongoing testing and analysis, as well as further updates to the
protocol if necessary. Overall, the process of submitting a protocol change proposal on DaoDao and implementing the proposal
once voted through requires careful consideration and collaboration within the nRide community to
ensure that the proposed changes are in the best interest of the network and its stakeholders. 16

Management Team & Advisors

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're summarizing a concept or process related to the nRide platform, possibly on a decentralized application (dApp) like DaoDao.

Here's a breakdown of what this passage appears to be stating:

- Monitoring the nRide network after a proposal has been implemented is crucial. This suggests that there are ongoing efforts to ensure that changes made through proposals have the desired outcome and don't cause unintended consequences.
  
- The process involves testing, analysis, and potential updates to the protocol if necessary. This indicates that the platform's developers or stakeholders (represented by the management team) continually evaluate and refine the nRide network based on its functionality and performance.

- The passage also mentions collaboration within the community to make sure proposed changes are beneficial for both the network and its stakeholders. This implies a collaborative approach to development, where multiple perspectives are considered before implementing new features or protocols.

As for the management team being composed of just two co-founders, it's worth noting that having only two founders is relatively common in many startups and decentralized applications. However, this doesn't necessarily mean they have limited resources or expertise â€“ it could simply reflect a more intimate and focused development approach.
