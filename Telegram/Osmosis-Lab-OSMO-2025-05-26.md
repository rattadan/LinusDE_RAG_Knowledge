## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to go through each message and identify what's important.

Starting from the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's probably just a help link, maybe not crucial for the summary unless it's related to the main topic. Then jasbanza talks about tax reasons depending on jurisdiction. Hmm, that might be part of a discussion on liquidity or transactions affecting taxes. 

Next, jasbanza mentions something about unrealized impermanent loss if it's out of range, and not wanting a transaction on record for removing a position. So here, the key point is about impermanent loss and the consequence of removing a position. 

Then jasbanza says you can partially remove from a position without closing the entire one. The user user_1782979360 responds that this forces taking losses. Yusungsang advises withdrawing and forming a new position, and the user comments that Osmosis doesn't allow editing existing positions like Uniswap, which is a drawback. Another jasbanza message says you need to create a new or additional position. The user's question was whether Osmosis allows editing the range bound of an existing pool or if they have to withdraw and create a new one. The answer seems to be that you must create a new position.

Then Yusungsang shares a link to a Twitter status, and JohnnyWyles87 mentions a forum post about increasing the deposit for proposals to 6000 OSMO. The osmogovbot message explains the proposal details: current deposit is 1600 OSMO (~$400), aiming to adjust it to 6000 OSMO to deter spam while keeping it accessible. JohnnyWyles87 also talks about a bridge being intermittent, causing assets like SOL and DOT alloys to be frozen until the issue is resolved.

Putting this together, the main topics are about governance proposal changes (deposit increase) and liquidity management issues (can't edit existing positions, leading to losses, and frozen assets due to bridge problems). The key decisions are the proposal to raise the deposit requirement and the technical limitation in Osmosis requiring new positions instead of editing existing ones. Also, the bridge issue causing temporary freezing

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. First, I need to read through all the messages and see what they're talking about. 

The first message is from osmosis_statbot, telling people to visit the support site if they need help. That seems like support-related, maybe customer support or official resources.

Then there's jasbanza talking about tax reasons depending on jurisdiction. Tax implications and legal stuff in different regions must be a topic. 

Another message from jasbanza mentions unrealized impermanent loss when out of range, and not wanting a transaction on record. So impermanent loss and transaction records are part of the discussion. 

They also mention partially removing liquidity without closing the entire position. That's about liquidity management strategies, like partial withdrawal. 

User_1782979360 says "this will force one to take losses," which relates to the previous point about impermanent loss. So maybe forced losses or financial impact is a topic here.

Yusungsang tells someone to withdraw and form a new position. That's about liquidity position adjustments, so creating new positions after withdrawal. 

User_1782979360 again talks about not being able to edit existing positions like Uniswap, which points to a comparison with other platforms and limitations in Osmosis's functionality. So the topic here could be limitations compared to other platforms, specifically Uniswap.

Jasbanza says you need to create a new or additional position, reinforcing the idea of position adjustments. 

The user's question about editing the range bound of existing pools and whether they must withdraw and create a new position is about liquidity pool management and the necessity of creating new positions instead of modifying existing ones.

Yusungsang shares a link to a Twitter status, but without the content, maybe the topic is social media or external references.

JohnnyWyles87 posts about a forum thread where the deposit required for proposals is being increased to 6000 OSMO. This is governance changes, specifically deposit requirements for proposals.

Osmogovbot quotes JohnnyWyles's proposal details, discussing adjusting the deposit parameter based on OSMO price to deter spam but keep it accessible. So governance parameters and their adjustments are a topic here.

Another message from JohnnyWyles mentions issues with a bridge causing assets to be frozen, and they're working on fixing it

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of the provided text. Let me start by reading through each message carefully.

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That seems neutral since it's just providing a resource.

Then, jasbanza mentions possible tax reasons depending on jurisdiction. Tax topics can be negative, but it's more informational, so probably neutral.

Another jasbanza message talks about unrealized impermanent loss if out of range. That's a financial term indicating a loss, which is negative. But the context is explaining a concept, so maybe the sentiment here is neutral because it's factual.

jasbanza also suggests partially removing a position instead of closing entirely. Neutral advice.

user_1782979360 says "this will force one to take losses." Definitely negative sentiment here, expressing frustration or concern.

Yusungsang tells someone to withdraw and form a new position. Neutral instruction.

user_1782979360 complains about not being able to edit existing positions like Uniswap and says it doesn't seem very good. Negative sentiment again.

jasbanza says to create a new position. Neutral.

Another user question about editing pool bounds. Neutral inquiry.

Yusungsang shares a link. Neutral.

JohnnyWyles87 mentions posting to forums. Neutral.

osmogovbot notifies about a proposal to increase deposit requirements. The message itself is neutral, just stating facts.

JohnnyWyles87 explains issues with the bridge causing assets to be frozen. This sounds negative because it's about problems and ongoing issues without a timeline.

Putting it all together: Most messages are neutral, providing information or instructions. However, there are a few negative statements from user_1782979360 about forced losses and dissatisfaction with features, and JohnnyWyles87's mention of frozen assets. The negative sentiments here are specific complaints. The overall sentiment might lean negative because of these user frustrations, but since the majority of the text is neutral, maybe the overall is neutral. Wait, but the user's messages are quite negative. The question is about the sentiment of the entire text. If there are multiple negative comments, even if other parts are neutral, the overall could be negative. Let me check again. The user's main points are about being forced to take losses and the platform not being good because it doesn

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any explicit or implicit actions that need to be taken.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot: it's a link to the support site. That's more of a resource than an action item, so probably not relevant here. 

Next, jasbanza at 13:54:01 talks about tax reasons depending on jurisdiction. That's a consideration but not an action item. 

Then, jasbanza at 13:53:38 mentions that if the position is out of range, it's an unrealized impermanent loss unless you don't want a transaction record. Again, informative, but no direct action here. 

At 13:52:50, jasbanza says you can partially remove from a position without closing the entire one. That's a possible action item‚Äîusers can take partial withdrawal as a next step. 

user_1782979360 at 13:52:39 states this forces taking losses. That's a consequence, not an action. 

Yusungsang at 13:51:47 says you need to withdraw and form a new position. So that's a clear action item: withdraw and create a new position. 

user_1782979360's previous message is a question about editing existing pools, which leads to the next message from Yusungsang at 13:50:18 saying to create a new position. So the decision here is that you can't edit existing positions, you have to make a new one. 

The user_1782979360's question is about whether Osmosis allows editing liquidity pool ranges. The answer from Yusungsang implies that you must withdraw and create a new position, which is a next step. 

Then there's a message from JohnnyWyles87 about a bridge being intermittent, causing assets to be frozen. He's in touch with them but no ETA. The action here might be that users need to wait until the bridge is fixed to remove assets. 

osmogovbot mentions JohnnyWyles posted a proposal to increase the deposit to
