# User Analysis: mhonkasalo

## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze several tweets from an account, breaking them down into specific categories. First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the main topics. The user mentioned ETH-aligned L2s, EigenLayer, prediction about 2026, trad markets adopting crypto features, appchains requiring experience, and L1 vs L2 competition.

Next, the language style and tone. The tweets are technical, using terms like "ETH-aligned L2," "proving infrastructure," "appchains." The tone seems confident and analytical, with some humor about trad markets. The user also mentions "hilarious" and "obvious," so maybe a bit of a witty or sarcastic edge.

Legitness evaluation: The user is talking about Ethereum scaling solutions and predictions. EigenLayer is a real project, so that's legitimate. The predictions about 2026 might be speculative, but the user is knowledgeable in the space. The account is likely part of the Ethereum ecosystem, so that's a key point.

Ecosystem: The account is promoting Ethereum-related projects, possibly EigenLayer, given the mention of forking protocols and using ETH as governance. They might be part of the Ethereum Layer 2 or scaling solutions community.

Character evaluation: The author seems to be a knowledgeable individual in blockchain, possibly a developer or researcher. Their communication is technical but not overly complex. They might be driven by the belief in Ethereum's future, with a focus on scalability and adoption. The tone is confident, maybe a bit dismissive of others' opinions, but also acknowledges the challenges. Decision-making is likely based on technical merits and long-term trends.

Putting it all together, the account is promoting Ethereum's L2 solutions and related projects, with a focus on scalability and adoption. The author is likely a technical expert in the space, confident in their predictions and values the long-term potential of Ethereum. They might be a developer or researcher, aiming to advocate for Ethereum's growth through technical solutions.

Keywords: Ethereum, Layer2, Scaling, EigenLayer, Cryptocurrency Adoption. These tags would help in categorizing the tweets for further analysis.

| messages | Next step from an ETH-aligned L2 is forking all major protocols & placing ETH as the governance / value capture token.

Expect someone will try this idea by 2026 or so. 

EigenLayer is essentially a version of this ‚Äî if you boil down underneath the overly complex terminology. |
| messages | Prediction from 2 years ago coming true. ETH-aligned rollup was only a matter of time. https://t.co/TlvkQFD2Et |
| messages | Trad markets being closed during weekends, outside working hours, & public holidays in 2025 is pretty hilarious.

Obvious a lot of market structure from crypto will get adopted by tradfi.

Price discovery will happen on blockchains if the change isn't made quickly enough. |

| messages | Just getting assets onto some of these new appchains requires 5+ years of experience in crypto.

Idk how people think this can be scalable to (anything resembling) mainstream usage in the next 3 years. |
| messages | L1 execution scaling competes with L2s ‚Äî Ethereum's main customers who were supposed to be prioritized.

Yes, offering a service that others offer too, is in fact, competing for market share.

A basic understanding of incentives told you this argument would start at some point. |
