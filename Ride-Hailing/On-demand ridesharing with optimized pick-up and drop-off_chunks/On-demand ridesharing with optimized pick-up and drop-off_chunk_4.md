**Original Text:**

However, trip sharing induces extra costs to the users in terms of delay, because vehicles may need to make long detours
to visit all the origins and destinations that they are serving (Čáp and Alonso-Mora, 2018). Such a problem does not exist in traditional
public transport systems (that are also shared), in which passengers walk towards the vehicle’s route instead of proceeding the other
way around. A similar idea can also be applied to a SMoD system, if the system decides for each user pick-up and drop-off (PUDO)

Throughout the paper, we will use the words “shared” and “ridesharing” when passengers (might) use the same vehicle at the same time, also
referred to as “ridepooling”. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103061
