## Overview

<think>
I'll analyze these two tweets/messages from the "Cosmos Airdrop Chat" channel. Let me break down each aspect:

2. Language style and tone:
The language style and tone is clearly confrontational and critical:

These messages appear to be opinionated statements rather than objectively legitimate analysis:
- They make broad, sweeping claims without evidence

- They focus on attacking the person rather than addressing specific arguments
- They don't appear to be part of a constructive dialogue but rather a debate tactic
