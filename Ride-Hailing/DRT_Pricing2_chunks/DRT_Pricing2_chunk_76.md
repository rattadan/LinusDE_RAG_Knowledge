## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 76

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Without FCFS integration, the matching aims for maximum efficiency, leading to some customers being
matched much earlier than others. With FCFS integration, only the
longest waiting customers are considered, resulting in a more inefficient
use of the fleet and thus intensifying the problem of undersupply. At the
same time, all customers now have to wait longer. In our experiments,

the price of fairness is an increase in the average waiting time by a
factor of 2 to 5. Additionally, in almost all cases, all quantile values of
the customer waiting times are better without the FCFS integration. What is the price of a quick response? The main argument
for the nearest strategy is the immediate response. The matchingbased approaches usually allow to delay the response up to the maximum waiting time ùëáùëä . While this can improve the solution quality
in some settings (cf. Table 2), it also decreases the customer convenience.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk explains the technical details and parameters related to dynamic trip-vehicle assignment in ride-hailing systems, specifically how FCFS integration affects the matching process.

**1. Exact technical details:**
The chunk discusses the impact of First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) integration on dynamic trip-vehicle assignment. Specifically, it explains that FCFS prioritizes the longest waiting customers first, resulting in a more efficient use of the fleet and undersupply issues.

**2. Connection to surrounding context:**
This chunk builds upon the broader discussion of ride-hailing systems and their operations in the provided document. It discusses various aspects of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems, including fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing.

**3. Specific requirements or conditions:**
The text mentions that FCFS integration has several implications:
- Inefficient use of the fleet
- Increased average waiting time for all customers (factor of 2 to 5)
- Decreased customer convenience

Overall, this chunk provides technical insights into how FCFS integration affects dynamic trip-vehicle assignment in ride-hailing systems.
