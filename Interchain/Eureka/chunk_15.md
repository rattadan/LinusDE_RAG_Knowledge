## Chunk 15

**Original Text:**

As a result, being added to the Skip Go API instantly offers distribution across the interchain for a new token
This document covers the basic requirements tokens must satisfy and steps their contributors must complete in order for Skip Go API to support transferring them throughout the interchain
Guide assumes using IBC for interop

This guide assumes you’re using IBC to transfer your token between chains. The Skip Go API supports other bridges and interop protocols in addition to IBC, including Hyperlane, CCTP, and Axelar. If you’re using one of these, please get in contact with us on our Discord. and we will help guide you through it to the extent we can. These other interop protocols are less standardized and/or less permissionless than IBC, so the process of adding support for transferring new tokens over them is more bespoke and varies by protocol.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like this message is providing information about how contributors to the Skip Go API can enable token distribution across multiple blockchain networks, using Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) as a bridging protocol.

To summarize:

* When adding a new token to the Skip Go API, it must satisfy basic requirements for tokens to be accepted.
* To support token transfer, contributors need to complete specific steps, which may vary depending on the chosen interoperability protocol (such as IBC).

If you have any further questions or would like more information about this process, feel free to ask!
