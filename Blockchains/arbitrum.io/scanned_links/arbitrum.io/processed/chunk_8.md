# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_8.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://arbitrum.io/*

### Document Overview  
This content outlines Arbitrum Stylus, a tool for deploying Rust smart contracts on the Arbitrum ecosystem, emphasizing performance, interoperability, and developer-friendly features like WebAssembly VM and reentrancy detection.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **WebAssembly VM**: Enables deployment of Rust contracts with seamless EVM interoperability.  
- **Multi-VM Paradigm**: Allows developers to optimize specific contracts with Stylus while leveraging the full EVM.  
- **Reentrancy Detection**: Rust SDK defaults to disabling reentrancy to enhance security.  
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) via WebAssembly.  
- **Native Liquidity**: Features like "Superposition" showcase native liquidity on Arbitrum.  
- **Decentralized Ownership**: Protocols like Lit Protocol leverage Stylus for decentralized digital ownership.  

### Implementation Details  
- **WebAssembly VM**: Deploy Rust contracts using WebAssembly (Wasm) for low-latency execution and cost efficiency.  
- **Reentrancy Prevention**: SDK defaults to disabling reentrancy (a common vulnerability in Ethereum contracts).  
- **Multi-VM Flexibility**: Developers can choose which contracts to optimize with Stylus (e.g., for performance gains).  
- **SDK Features**: Includes tools for building, testing, and deploying contracts, with tutorials for developers.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Highlighted as "cheaper memory and compute" compared to traditional L2 solutions.  

### Related Topics  
- **Arbitrum Ecosystem**: Connections to broader Arbitrum documentation (e.g., Arbitrum Nova, SDK tutorials).  
- **Rust SDK**: Integration with Stylus for building scalable, secure decentralized applications.  
- **Interoperability**: Links to EVM compatibility and cross-chain capabilities.  
- **Case Studies**: References specific projects (e.g., OpenZeppelin, Lit Protocol) demonstrating Stylusâ€™ real-world applications.

Unlock cheaper memory and compute like never before.

Thanks to a WebAssembly VM, you can deploy Rust smart contracts with seamless interoperability with the EVM.

This MultiVM paradigm means you can choose which contracts within your protocol to optimize with Stylus.

Build safer with affordable reentrancy detection. The Rust SDK has reentrancy disabled by default.

One Chain, Many Languages

Leverage familiar tools and frameworks of other languages while also benefiting from their specific features.
