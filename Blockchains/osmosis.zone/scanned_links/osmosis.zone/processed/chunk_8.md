ATOM is Money ‚Ä¢ Osmosis the DeFi Hub

Osmosis is the premier cross-chain DeFi hub ‚öõÔ∏è  As the liquidity center and primary trading venue of Cosmos, Osmosis is the access point for the world of appchains  More than 50 blockchains are currently connected, with dozens more in development‚Äî @dYdX  Chain, or  @Injective_

No doubt that  @osmosiszone  is the most dominant DEX in  @cosmos

The way Milk Tia is fully integrated into osmosis is amazing.

Osmosis is becoming the interchain App Store.

@OsmosisZone has established itself as the hub of the Celestia modular ecosystem.

I think Osmosis Grant Program has done a really good job funding things that are LONG TERM value accretive to Osmosis

EIP 1559 on Osmosis is amazing

Every defi app should build on osmosis

Osmosis is not just one of the most active projects by dev activity (see @cryptomanran's post below), it's also the most active Cosmos chain for
governance activity EVERY SINGLE MONTH

@osmosiszone keeps shipping. $OSMO üß™

Osmosis as the Liquidity Hub ( We can crop around this post )

@osmosiszone has the best UI/UX in crypto hands down. I understand real yield is where the market is heading towards, but without attractive front ends, you won‚Äôt bring masses into web 3.

$osmo did it right and it‚Äôs a pleasure to use each time. They even do holidays.

Osmosis is not just one of the most active projects by dev activity (see  @cryptomanran 's post below), it's also the most active Cosmos chain for governance activity EVERY SINGLE MONTH  @osmosiszone  keeps shipping. $OSMO üß™

Speaking of the UI, I think osmosis has the best in class UI/UX for a DEX. Everything is clear, concise and they also make IBC transfers to/from the Osmosis chain completely frictionless.

This. This is the stuff that drives mass mainstream adoption. This is why osmosis has more users than any other chain in the IBC. This is why the Osmosis team is always intent on improving UI.
