- **Ecosystem Integration**: Mention of contributions to Cosmos, Dfinity/Internet Computer, and Celo ecosystems (e.g., Arweave, Ethereum).  
- **Technical Features**: Focus on minimalistic design, interoperability, and token standard development (e.g., KYVE’s data lake solution).  

### Related Topics  
- **Interchain Ecosystem**: Likely connected to documentation discussing cross-chain protocols or interoperability solutions.  
- **Web3 Advocacy**: May link to sections on organizational roles or policy frameworks in the broader Noble documentation.
