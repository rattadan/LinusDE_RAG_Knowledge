## Overview

Here's a brief summary of each tweet:

1. **Main topic:** The author compares their own opinion to others, implying that it will be widely accepted or obvious within a few years.
2. **Language style and tone:** The language is casual and conversational, with a hint of self-deprecation ("AKT just feels like"). The tone is neutral to slightly sarcastic.
3. **Key characteristics of communication:**
   - **Authenticity**: The author's opinion feels genuine and relatable.
   - **Relatability**: The tweet acknowledges the subjective nature of opinions and implies that everyone will have a similar perspective in the future.
   - **Conversational tone**: The use of colloquial expressions ("one that everyone will say") creates a sense of informality, making the conversation feel more like a chat with friends rather than an official statement.
