## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 18

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Activity locations are only used as origins and
destinations (and not as nodes in the network), and form a critical component that helps the
POLARIS router route trips. Location data is generated from underlying building and
employment information and make up the most frequently visited addresses in the region. Since
these locations are already used by traveler agents in POLARIS, travelers can walk to and from a
location (like when travelers get out of their car, or deboard a bus). PUDOs forming a subset of
these locations are, therefore, accessible and make for a great choice for PUDO locations. This
simplification (as compared to designating specific streets or curb spaces for TNC pickups and
drop-offs) should not affect aggregate or regional fleet analysis. PUDO zones were sampled
using a hierarchical clustering algorithm for all possible origins and destinations in the software
R.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Text Chunk:**

1. **Technical Details:** The text chunk discusses how activity locations are used as origins, destinations, but not as nodes in the network, which is essential for the POLARIS router to route trips effectively. It mentions that location data is generated from underlying building and employment information.
2. **Context Connection:** This chunk connects to the surrounding context by providing background information on the POLARIS software and its usage. It explains how activity locations are incorporated into the system, enabling it to efficiently route trips.
3. **Requirements and Constraints:**
	* The use of location data from underlying building and employment information is a requirement for the POLARIS router's functionality.
	* The text implies that these activities should not affect aggregate or regional fleet analysis due to the hierarchical clustering algorithm used to sample PUDO zones.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints Mentioned:**

1. A hierarchical clustering algorithm must be applied to sample PUDO zones.
2. Activity locations are critical components of the POLARIS router's routing system.
3. Location data from underlying building and employment information is necessary for efficient routing.
4. The use of location data does not affect aggregate or regional fleet analysis.

Overall, this text chunk provides technical details on how activity locations contribute to the functioning of the POLARIS software, while also highlighting its requirements and constraints for effective operation.
