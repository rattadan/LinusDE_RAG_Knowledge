## Source Context
*From: https://www.dydx.xyz/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses how factors like the Federal Reserve's policies, crypto upgrades (e.g., Ethereum's "The Merge"), and on-chain data influence trading volumes and prices in the cryptocurrency market.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **On-chain data**: Information about blockchain transactions and user activity, analyzed by firms like Glassnode to assess safety and adoption.  
- **Crypto upgrades**: Software changes (e.g., Ethereum's PoW to PoS transition) that drive market enthusiasm by improving efficiency or security.  
- **Fed policies**: Central bank actions (e.g., liquidity facilitation) that lower borrowing costs and increase trading activity in digital assets.  
- **P2P payments**: Decentralized transactions on blockchain networks, critical for on-chain data analysis.  
- **Market activity**: Traders' behavior influenced by factors like transaction volume, wallet addresses, and energy consumption (e.g., "akanodes").  

### Implementation Details  
- **Example of crypto upgrade impact**: Ethereum's "The Merge" (September 2022) caused price increases from $993 to $1,900 in August 2022 due to perceived improvements in security and efficiency.  
- **On-chain data tools**: Firms like Glassnode, LookIntoBitcoin, and Chainalysis publish reports on transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and energy consumption (e.g., "akanodes") to influence market perceptions.  
- **Trading volume metrics**: Analysts track average daily transactions, growing wallet addresses, and exchange flows to gauge bullish sentiment.  

### Related Topics  
- **Fed policies** are connected to the document’s discussion of liquidity and market activity.  
- **On-chain data analysis** (e.g., Glassnode reports) is a recurring theme, linking to broader blockchain analysis practices.  
- **Crypto upgrades** (e.g., PoW to PoS) are explicitly mentioned, tying to technical details about blockchain protocols.

like the Federal Reserve (Fed), making it easier for traders and businesses to borrow funds and put money into cryptocurrency. All of these factors mean more people have extra capital to spend on assets like cryptocurrency, often leading to the higher trading volumes seen during bull runs.

There are also crypto-specific factors that drive trading activity in the digital assets sector. For instance, whenever a cryptocurrency project has a scheduled upgrade on their software, it often triggers excitement in the space. Or, if traders feel the upgrade improves some aspect of the crypto asset and doesnât introduce new issues or security concerns, it often attracts bullish market activity. One example of this phenomenon is when Ethereum transitioned from its original consensus model ofproof-of-work (PoW)toproof-of-stake (PoS)in an event called âThe Merge.â This event took place on September 15, 2022, and in the months leading up to the Merge, the price per ETH rose from a recent low of$993 in June 2022 to around $1,900 in August.

The field of âon-chain dataââor information about a crypto networkâs user activityâalso plays a role determining a coin or tokenâs price. On-chain refers to the decentralized payment networks (akablockchains) cryptocurrencies use to powerpeer-to-peer (P2P)payments. Firms like Glassnode, LookIntoBitcoin, and Chainalysis scan activity on blockchains and publish reports on their findings, often influencing the perception of a particular crypto assetâs safety and adoption. Bullish on-chain data often includes an increasing average daily transactions, growing cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and more computers (akanodes) contributing energy to a blockchainâs validation process. On-chain analysts also monitor the flows of cryptocurrencies to and from exchanges, which gives a glimpse into whether more people are withdrawing cryptocurrency into private wallets or depositing on exchanges to potentially sell their digital assets.Â
