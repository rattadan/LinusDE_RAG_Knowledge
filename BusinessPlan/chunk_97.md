**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you've provided two separate sources:

1. A press release from Uber announcing their financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022.
2. An article on Mordor Intelligence's website discussing the ride hailing market, including its growth, trends, COVID-19 impact, and forecasts.
