**LLM Contextual Output:**

The citation appears to be about autonomous driving and its potential impact on individual mobility behaviors. Specifically, it discusses a study titled "Autonomous driving: The impact of vehicle automation on mobility behavior" published in 2016 by the Institute for Mobility Research (ifmo).

However, there are several errors in your request:

1. There is no "doi" at the end of the citation. In academic citations, the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is typically included after the journal title.
2. The citation does not include a specific author name or last name, which is common practice when citing sources with multiple authors.
3. It's unclear who Trommer, Kolarova, E., F., Kröger, L., Kickhöfer, B., Kuhnimhof, T., Lenz, B., Phleps, P., 2016 is referring to. If you could provide more context or clarify who this refers to, I would be happy to try and assist further.

If you're looking for information on autonomous driving or mobility research, I can try to provide some general information or point you in the direction of relevant resources.
