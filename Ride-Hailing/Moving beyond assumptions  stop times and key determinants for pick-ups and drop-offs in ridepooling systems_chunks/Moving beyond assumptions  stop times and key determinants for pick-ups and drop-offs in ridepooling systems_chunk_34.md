**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided text chunk:

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The data is analyzed using Transportmetrics, a transportation research organization.
* The dataset contains variables related to passenger behavior, such as age, time of day (Sprinter vs. Virtual), and physical characteristics like bulky baggage and passengers' weight.
* The results are expressed in terms of pseudo R2 values for model fit, which indicate the strength of association between variables.

**Context Connection and Building Upon:**

The current text chunk provides an analysis of stop times concerning passengers aged ten to 59, as part of a broader investigation into ride-pooling services. This context is built upon by highlighting the use of advanced simulation tools (e.g., MATSim) to model ride-pooling strategies and their operational aspects.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The analysis requires robust statistical methods, such as pseudo R2 values and Durbin-Watson test, to account for heteroskedasticity. It also assumes that the data is suitable for modeling purposes, with variables meeting certain criteria (e.g., VIF < 1.149). Additionally, the results are likely to be of interest to researchers, policymakers, or industry professionals seeking to understand ride-pooling services in urban contexts.

**Specific Analysis:**

The analysis reveals a significant difference in stop times between Sprinter and Virtual modes for passengers aged ten to 59. Specifically:

* Passengers under 20 years old have shorter wait times (P < 0.001) compared to those aged 60 and older.
* Children (aged 10-19) experience extended stop times (P < 0.05), indicating potential issues with ride-pooling services designed for this demographic.

Overall, the analysis provides insights into how different passenger characteristics influence stop times in ride-pooling services, offering a nuanced understanding of these systems' operational and sustainability implications.
