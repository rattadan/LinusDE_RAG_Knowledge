**Original Text:**

Noteworthy is that these calculations can be easily parallelized, for instance, if each vehicle carries its own computer and
computes the trips in which it participates. • The optimal assignment has to be found just once, when solving the ILP described by Eqs. (8)–(11), but the instance is the whole GVgraph, which might be large. Nevertheless, standard solvers are able to find the optimal solution (up to a small tolerance) in just a
few seconds. It is worth commenting about the optimality of this approach. If no heuristics are used and enough computational resources and
time are available, the method we propose in this paper is optimal for AP as the one we take as a base, by Alonso-Mora et al. (2017). However, in real-life cases this might be impossible. The crucial difference is given by the number of possible PUDO points for each
trip.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk provides detailed technical details regarding parallelization techniques and optimization approaches for ridesharing systems using computational methods.

### Technical Details:

1. **Parallelization:** The chunk discusses how to easily parallelize calculations, such as solving linear programming (LP) problems like the one described by Eqs. (8)–(11). This is achieved through standard solvers that can find optimal solutions efficiently with a small tolerance, typically within seconds.

2. **Optimization Approach:** It highlights an alternative optimization approach where no heuristics are used and enough computational resources and time are available. This method, proposed by Alonso-Mora et al. (2017), is considered optimal for AP but notes that in real-life cases it might not be possible due to the large size of the GVgraph.

3. **Computational Complexity:** The text mentions the complexity involved in solving such LP problems and how this can be addressed through parallelization, which improves computational efficiency without significantly increasing the problem-solving time.

4. **Comparison:** It provides a comparison between using standard solvers for an optimal solution (as suggested by Alonso-Mora et al., 2017) and alternative approaches that might not be feasible in real-life scenarios due to computational constraints.

5. **Contextual Connection:** The chunk builds upon the surrounding context, focusing specifically on ridesharing systems and their optimization challenges. It connects this technical discussion to broader themes such as modeling, mathematical frameworks, optimization heuristics, simulation, service design, and flexibility in ride-sharing systems.
