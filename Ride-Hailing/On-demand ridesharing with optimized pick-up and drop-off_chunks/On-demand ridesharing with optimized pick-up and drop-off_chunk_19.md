**Original Text:**

This restriction can be quite limiting, as it can only be applied when the cotravelersâ€™ origins (or destinations) are very close to each other, while an efficient ridesharing system might also match passengers when
the origin of one of them is close to any point of the route of the other (like in Fig. 2 above). From a theoretical point of view, the mathematical problem that emerges for a single vehicle that can choose PUDO points for its
passengers is studied by Li et al. (2015) and Fielbaum (2021): the former considers that the order in which the requests are served can
be optimized, showing that this makes an NP-Hard problem and proposing a dynamic-programming approach to solve it; while the
latter assumes that the said order is fixed, where the problem can be solved in polynomial time. On a slightly different note, Gambella
et al. (2018) propose a VRP (vehicle routing problem) version in which walking is allowed, studying ways to solve the induced linear
relaxation.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text focuses on the technical details and parameters related to ridesharing systems, particularly those involving meeting points. Here's a detailed analysis:

**Technical Details:**

1. **Meeting Points:** The concept of meeting points in ridesharing refers to designated locations where passengers can pick up or drop off their vehicles at the same time, without having to physically meet with each other. In this context, meeting points are crucial for efficient and user-friendly experience.
2. **Mathematical Models:** Mathematical models play a vital role in solving the problem of ridesharing systems with meeting points. The papers mentioned (Li et al., Fielbaum, Gambella) propose various mathematical frameworks to optimize the order of requests served by a single vehicle.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Li et al.'s paper proposes a dynamic-programming approach to solve the problem of optimizing the order of requests for a ridesharing system with meeting points.

**Parameters and Processes:**

1. **Origin-destination relationships:** The text discusses how the mathematical models are applied when the origin and destination of one traveler is close to each other, allowing passengers to be matched efficiently.
2. **Vehicle routing problems (VRPs):** The papers mentioned study ways to solve the induced linear relaxation problem, which is a variant of the classic VRP.

**Context Connection and Building Upon:**

1. **Summary of Key Papers:** The text provides a summary of key papers related to ridesharing systems with meeting points, highlighting Li et al.'s work on dynamic-programming approaches.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Approaches:** Wen et al.'s paper proposes reinforcement learning approaches for optimizing ridesharing problems, building upon the existing mathematical models and approaches discussed in this section.
