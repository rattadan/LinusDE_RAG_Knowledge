Putting this in context:
The @rekt_gang account appears to be a community promoter within the Web3/NFT space, focusing on helping followers understand and participate in NFT mints. The username references a common slang term related to losses in crypto/NFTs, suggesting either someone who has experienced losses themselves but continues to participate in the space, or someone using this as a branding element to connect with others who have had similar experiences. Their promotional content for "madscientists_x" and other projects suggests they might be functioning as a booster or influencer for emerging NFT collections.

My analysis shows they're positioning themselves as part of a larger Web3/NFT community, sharing both promotional content and metrics about project performance.
