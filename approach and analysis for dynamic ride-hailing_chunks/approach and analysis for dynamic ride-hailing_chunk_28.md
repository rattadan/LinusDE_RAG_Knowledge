I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

Possible
actions per request are reject, postpone, or assign to a vehicle, indicated
by the ID of the assigned vehicle. If a request is rejected, it cannot be
assigned in future epochs. Vehicles can only be assigned to at most
one pending request at a time, provided that the vehicle is available
for receiving a new request (see below) and the estimated time of
arrival at the pickup location is within the maximum waiting time. In case such an assignment is feasible, the vehicle has to start setting
up for this request immediately after a potential current customer
is dropped off. Feasible assignments cannot be changed, retracted,
or postponed. Furthermore, ùëéùë£ is a tuple that represents the action
associated with each of the vehicles. Possible actions per vehicle are
continue or reposition to parking lot, indicated by the ID of the parking
lot. Continuing means that the vehicle continues the planned jobs like
setup, processing, or repositioning, or that it stays idling.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk describes a specific aspect of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.

**Technical details:**

* The context mentions a "situational awareness" system for managing vehicle assignments.
* Vehicles can be assigned to requests based on availability, estimated time of arrival, and other criteria.
* Actions per request include rejecting, postponing, or assigning the vehicle to a parking lot (repositioning).

**Connection to the surrounding context:**

This chunk builds upon the broader discussion of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, specifically referencing the following sources:

1. Simulation and modeling papers: bischoff & maciejewski (2016), braverman et al. (2019)
2. Survey articles on demand forecasting: ho et al. (2018); jiao et al. (2021) - which discuss dial-a-ride problems
3. Papers on dynamic dispatch and repositioning: geng et al. (2019); jiao et al. (2021)

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

The following requirements are mentioned:

* Vehicles can only be assigned to at most one pending request at a time.
* The estimated time of arrival must be within the maximum waiting time for the pickup location.
* Feasible assignments cannot be changed, retracted, or postponed.

Note that these requirements and conditions may vary depending on the specific ride-hailing system being described.
