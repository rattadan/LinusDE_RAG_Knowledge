**Original Text:**

Additionally, we show that, especially for low-utilized fleets, the simple
nearest-vehicle assignment strategy outperforms matching-based assignment approaches in many settings. The
insights gained are analyzed and thoroughly discussed. 1. Introduction

in order to reach good solutions since both parts heavily affect the
overall quality. For the repositioning part, we propose a new strategy based on the identified weaknesses in existing approaches from
the literature. Regarding the selection of an appropriate assignment
strategy, we realized that most of the papers in the literature that
study this kind of problem only consider one very specific setting for
which a solution method is presented (see Section 2). For example,
the fleet size is fixed, there is a specific maximum waiting time, only
idling vehicles are allowed to receive a new request assignment, and
a specific number of requests is temporally uniformly distributed over
the planning horizon.
