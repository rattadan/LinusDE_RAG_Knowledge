**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're discussing the evolution of public transportation services and the increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles in this sector. Here's a summary of your points:

The concept of new categories within public transit services is gaining traction, with some examples including:

1. Shared transportation (e.g., Samaride or pooling)
2. Responsive transportation (e.g., responsive ride-hailing)

However, most existing public transit services are still largely based on driver-controlled vehicles.

There has been a trend towards the use of demand-responsive or ride-hailing models, with a small number of services experimenting with autonomous vehicles. Currently, only a few examples exist in this space:

1. Autonomous vehicle-based services: [5, 7]

These conventional driver-controlled vehicles are being used to support the growth of new categories such as shared transportation and responsive transportation.

It's worth noting that while autonomous vehicles may be an area of interest for public transit providers, they require significant investment, infrastructure upgrades, and regulatory changes before they can become a viable option.
