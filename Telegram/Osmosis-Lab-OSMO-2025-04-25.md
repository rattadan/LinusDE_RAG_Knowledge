## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages.

First, I'll scan through each message to identify the main topics. The earliest messages are from osmosis_statbot repeating the support site. Then, osmogovbot mentions a proposal from Bitfrost about revenue sharing for UTXOs on Osmosis. That seems important‚Äîthere's a new agreement involving waiving bridging fees in exchange for taker fees from specific trading pairs like DOGE.int3. The user might need to know that this is aimed at boosting adoption of those UTXOs.

Next, there's a discussion between Mrtiahou and kychuli about Polaris replacing Osmosis's Dex interface. Mrtiahou suggests that Polaris could replace the current interface, and kychuli explains that the Polaris vault would allow storing assets across chains without needing multiple accounts, simplifying trades by avoiding repeated deposits/withdrawals. Also, kychuli clarifies that Polaris isn't abandoned but is now a separate app using Osmosis as a liquidity layer. So key points here are the role of Polaris, its integration with Osmosis, and the abstraction of cross-chain complexities.

Then, Chessmany3k has issues with withdrawing to SUI and Keplr wallet glitches. kychuli troubleshoots by asking about the token type (alloy sui vs sui.wh) and the withdrawal method. This part is about user support issues, errors during transfers, and needing to swap to bridge tokens. The support site is mentioned again, which is a recurring point.

Mrtiahou also asks if Polaris is no longer being developed, and kychuli responds that it's just a separate app now. So the decision here is that development continues but as a separate application.

Putting it all together, the main elements are the Bitfrost revenue share proposal, the Polaris interface changes, and the technical support issues. The summary should highlight the agreement details, the status and functionality of Polaris, and the user-reported problems with SUI withdrawals and wallet errors. I need to make sure decisions and key points are clearly stated without extra details. Let me structure that concisely.

**Summary:**  
1. **Bitfrost Revenue Sharing Proposal**: Bitfrost proposes waiving bridging fees for Osmosis transactions involving BTC.int3

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a support message directing users to the official support site. That seems like a recurring topic since it appears multiple times, so "Support Site" is one topic.

Next, the message from osmogovbot mentions a Protocol Revenue Sharing Agreement between Bitfrost and Osmosis. The main points here are Bitfrost, Osmosis, and UTXOs. The agreement involves waiving bridging fees and sharing taker fees for specific tokens like DOGE.int3, BTC.int3, etc. So topics here would be Bitfrost, Osmosis, UTXOs, Protocol Revenue Sharing Agreement, Bridging Fees Waiver, and Taker Fees.

Then there's a message from Mrtiahou talking about Polaris replacing the Dex Osmosis interface. That introduces "Polaris" and "Dex Interface Replacement." The same user later asks if Polaris will no longer be developed, so "Future Development of Polaris" is another topic.

Kychuli's messages mention a vault storing assets across chains without new accounts, which relates to "Cross-Chain Asset Storage" and "Vault System." They also reference a forum post about the Interchain Liquidity Hub, so that's a separate topic. Additionally, they discuss using Polaris as a separate app with Osmosis as a liquidity layer, leading to "Polaris as Separate App" and "Liquidity Layer."

Chessmany3k and Kychuli have a conversation about transfer errors and withdrawal issues to SUI, mentioning Keplr Wallet glitches. These point to topics like "Transfer Errors," "Withdrawal Issues to SUI," and "Keplr Wallet Glitches."

Mrtiahou also mentions Polaris vault equating to a Legacy account and deposit/withdrawal as just swaps, so "Legacy Account Equivalence" and "Deposit/Withdrawal Process" are topics. Kychuli's advice to swap to bridge token (alloy sui or sui.wh) introduces "Bridge Token Swapping."

Putting this all together, I need to list each distinct topic without repetition. Let me check each message again to ensure I didn't miss anything. The main topics seem to

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a series of chat messages from different participants. I need to go through each message and determine the overall sentiment. Let me start by reading through each one carefully.

First, there's osmosis_statbot at 2025-04-25T13:57:31: a support message directing users to the official site. That seems neutral, just providing information.

Next, osmogovbot at 2025-04-25T12:38:26: sharing a post about a revenue-sharing agreement. The content here is factual and informative, so neutral again.

Then Mrtiahou at 2025-04-25T08:25:26: "Okaay, So Polaris could well replace the Dex osmosis interface as we know it." The word "replace" might have a negative connotation, but the user is just stating a possibility. Maybe they're neutral, but could be slightly negative if they're implying something bad.

kychuli at 2025-04-25T08:04:53: explaining how the vault works. This is a technical explanation, so neutral.

Another osmosis_statbot at 08:01:03: same support message, neutral.

kychuli at 08:01:02: offering help with support tickets. Also neutral, maybe slightly positive because they're helping.

Chessmany3k at 07:59:24: "Error with transfer, please try again." This is a negative statement about an error.

kychuli at 07:58:07: asking if there's an error. Neutral question.

kychuli at 07:57:16: advising on swapping tokens. Neutral technical advice.

kychuli at 07:56:08: asking about withdrawal method. Neutral.

Chessmany3k at 07:55:54: "can't withdraw to sui." Negative because of the inability to perform an action.

Chessmany3k at 07:54:46: asking about Keplr wallet glitch. Negative due to a problem.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll need to go through each message carefully and see what's relevant.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a link to the support site. Not an action item unless someone needs to visit it, but since it's just a bot message, maybe not. Then osmogovbot mentions a post by @muthiman about a Bitfrost revenue share proposal. The abstract talks about waiving bridging fees and sharing taker fees. That sounds like a decision or next step because it's a formal proposal. I should note that the agreement involves waiving fees in exchange for revenue sharing.

Next, Mrtiahou says Polaris could replace the Dex interface. That's a possible decision or next step, but phrased as a suggestion. Maybe the team is considering it, but not sure if it's finalized. Then kychuli and Mrtiahou discuss Polaris vaults and deposits/withdrawals. Mrtiahou asks if the development is stopping, and kychuli refers to a forum post about the Interchain Liquidity Hub. So there's a link provided and an explanation that Polaris is a separate app using Osmosis as a liquidity layer. That could be a next step indicating ongoing development.

Chessmany3k has issues with transfers, error messages, and withdrawing to Sui. kychuli is helping them troubleshoot: check if they have alloy SUI or sui.wh, suggest swapping to bridge token, and asks what they're using for withdrawal. These are action items for Chessmany3k to follow, like providing screenshots, their address, or swapping tokens.

Also, Chessmany3k mentions Keplr wallet glitching. kychuli's response about opening a support ticket with details is an action item. So the user needs to do specific things like open a ticket, provide info.

Putting it all together, the main action items are the support requests (opening tickets, providing details), the proposal from Bitfrost and Osmosis, and the development direction of Polaris. Decisions include the revenue-sharing agreement. Next steps involve troubleshooting the transfer errors and the development of Polaris as a separate app.

I need to structure these clearly, maybe in bullet points, separating action items, decisions, next steps. Also,
