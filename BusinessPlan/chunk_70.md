## Chunk 70

**Original Text:**

nRide's revenue model, which revolves around the purchase and sale of $NRIDE tokens, sets it apart from
other ride-hailing platforms. Drivers using the nRide application can save up to £1K-£1.5K per month
compared to other platforms, as nRide charges no commission or service fees. Furthermore, drivers have
greater control over their earnings as they can name their own prices. To use the nRide application, users
must possess $NRIDE tokens, which interact with the escrow smart contract. nRide captures value from
selling $NRIDE tokens from the DAO and creating an economy around the $NRIDE token.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems that nRide's revenue model is unique in several ways compared to other ride-hailing platforms:

1. **No commission or service fees**: Unlike traditional ride-hailing platforms, nRide charges no commission or service fees for drivers.
2. **Greater earnings control**: Drivers can set their own prices, giving them more flexibility and potentially higher earning potential compared to other platforms.
3. **Capital appreciation through token sales**: By selling $NRIDE tokens from the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), nRide creates an economy around the token, which could lead to increased value appreciation.

However, it's worth noting that these unique features might also attract different types of users and have implications for the platform's business model.
