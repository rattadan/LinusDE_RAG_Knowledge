**Context**

The tweets appear to originate from an individual or group using Twitter, with @kirbxbt initially making a humorous statement about being "not depressed" and later sharing a quote from another user. The quotes are likely from two separate social media posts.

The second tweet appears to be a discussion on election rigging in the US, referencing specific issues (paper ballots, vote verification) and using colloquial language ("rigged", "vouch"). The third tweet seems unrelated to the previous ones, with another user making a statement about voting and election integrity.
