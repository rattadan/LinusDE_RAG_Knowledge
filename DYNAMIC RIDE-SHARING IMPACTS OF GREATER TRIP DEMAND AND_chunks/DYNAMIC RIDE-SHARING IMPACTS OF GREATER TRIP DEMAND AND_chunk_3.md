## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 3

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

At 0.25 mi PUDO spacings
(thoughtfully placed, using origin and destination clusters), travelers walked less than 5 min at
either trip end, on average, while 0.5 mi spacings lead to about an additional 1 min of walking. More evenly distributed and large SAV demand can save up to 39% total VMT from DRS and
stops. It is also important to prepare for queuing areas at PUDOs in settings of high trip densities,
to limit curbside congestion. Keywords: Shared autonomous vehicles, stop aggregation, dynamic ride-sharing, trip densities. BACKGROUND
Ridehailing or Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) like Uber (offered almost globally),
Lyft (in the U.S.), DiDi (in China), and Ola (in India, U.K., and Australia) have popularized
shared mobility by providing cost-effective rides to travelers around the world relative to taxis
and other similar forms of shared transport. Pooled or shared rides that are matched real-time and

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis:**

This text chunk focuses on technical details related to Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) such as their spacing, trip duration, and demand analysis.

1. **Technical Details:** The specific technical details mentioned in this chunk are:
   - PUDO spacings (0.25 mi)
   - Origin-destination clusters
   - Average walking time at either end of a trip (less than 5 minutes)
   - Additional walking time due to larger SAV demand (1 minute)

2. **Context:** This context builds upon the surrounding text, which discusses shared autonomous vehicles and their potential impacts on urban transportation systems. The chunk provides specific details about how SAVs can optimize routes and reduce congestion.

3. **Requirements and Constraints:**
   - To analyze this technical detail, one would need to consult existing studies or reports related to SAVs, specifically those that focus on trip durations and spacing.
   - Additionally, access to the Elsevier publication mentioned in the text is required for a detailed analysis of the Corresponding Author's credentials (2022 published by Elsevier).

**Specific Requirements:**

- The document context requires knowledge of shared autonomous vehicles and their potential impacts on urban transportation systems.
- Access to specific studies or reports related to SAVs, particularly those that discuss trip durations and spacing, is necessary for further analysis.

**Trends Across the Papers:**

- The text mentions several key authors who have contributed significantly to the field of SAVs. This could indicate a research gap in certain areas, prompting future studies to explore these topics more thoroughly.
- The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, suggesting that existing research on SAVs may not have fully captured their full potential or impacts.
