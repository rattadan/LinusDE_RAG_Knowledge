followed by statistics covering the size of the market. Our initial market launch will be in the UK for the
nRide application that interacts with ride-hailing drivers/riders. As a result, stats will be based on UK
users. However, this doesn’t limit the nRide registry and protocol products to only the UK.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're providing a section from an investor presentation or a business plan document for nRide. I'll summarize and provide feedback on the information provided.

Market Analysis: The section provides an overview of the addressable customers for nRide, which are individuals who will interact with the ride-hailing driver/riders application. According to this analysis, it seems that nRide's initial market launch will be in the UK for its product that interacts with ride-hailing drivers/riders.

Here are some key points and observations:

1. **Addressable Customers**: The addressable customers for nRide seem to include individuals who use ride-hailing services.
2. **UK Focus**: Although it doesn't limit the nRide registry and protocol products to only the UK, this could be a limitation in terms of geographic scope.
3. **Market Size Statistics**: It's mentioned that the size of the market is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, we can infer that it's likely significant given the launch focus in the UK.
4. **Non-Limited Scope**: The fact that nRide's registry and protocol products are "addressable" implies that they can be used globally, which could be a benefit for users worldwide.

Some potential areas to consider:

1. **Geographic Scope Limitation**: Although not explicitly stated, it's likely that the geographic scope is limited to the UK as mentioned.
2. **Target Audience**: While the addressable customers are specified as ride-hailing drivers/riders in the UK, we don't know if this means they're also users of nRide services elsewhere or if they'll be using their own applications.
3. **Market Size and Growth Potential**: Understanding the market size and growth potential is crucial for assessing the scalability and profitability of nRide.
4. **Competition and Differentiation**: How will nRide differentiate itself from existing ride-hailing services and protocol platforms to attract users?
