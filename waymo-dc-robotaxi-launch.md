## Summary
Alphabet's self-driving unit Waymo plans to launch its fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Washington, D.C. in 2026. Waymo has already started moving vehicles to the city and is working with policymakers to establish a legal framework for driverless operations, as current regulations do not permit fully autonomous vehicles. Waymo One, the company's service, is already active in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin, with plans to expand to Atlanta, Miami, and then Washington, D.C. The company has provided over 4 million paid trips in 2024 and currently delivers more than 200,000 paid passenger trips weekly. Despite some regulatory and safety concerns, Waymo continues to expand, recently raising $5.6 billion. Safety investigations and recalls have occurred, but Waymo claims its vehicles are involved in significantly fewer injury-causing crashes than human drivers.
