### Document Overview  
The content outlines Bitcoin's creation by Nakamoto, the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, early adoption, historical price milestones, and the significance of the 2010 pizza party commemorating the first Bitcoin purchase.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: A consensus mechanism where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain.  
- **Decentralized Network**: A peer-to-peer system without central authority, relying on distributed nodes.  
- **Blockchain**: A distributed ledger recording transactions across a network of computers.  
- **Transaction Verification**: Nodes verify transactions six times before broadcasting them to the public ledger.  
- **Mining Rewards**: Miners receive Bitcoin (BTC) and transaction fees for solving PoW puzzles.  
- **Block Interval**: Blocks are added every 10 minutes to maintain network synchronization.  

### Implementation Details  
- **PoW Algorithm**: Computers solve advanced cryptographic puzzles (e.g., SHA-256) every 10 minutes to validate transactions.  
- **Reward System**: Miners receive BTC and transaction fees for successful puzzle-solving.  
- **Transaction Verification**: Nodes verify transactions six times before broadcasting them to the public ledger.  
- **First Bitcoin Price**: The first recorded price was $0.00099 per coin in 2009 on BitcoinTalk.  
- **Pizza Party**: A 2010 event commemorating the first Bitcoin purchase with a Papa John's pizza.  

### Related Topics  
- **Whitepaper**: The "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by Nakamoto.  
- **Mainstream Adoption**: Media coverage and price increases in the early 2010s.  
- **Historical Milestones**: Early adopters, mining rewards, and the 2010 pizza party as cultural landmarks.

Nakamoto released a whitepaper,Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. Drawing on previous projects such as eCash and EGold, Nakamoto proposed using a new decentralized computer network or blockchain to create a censorship-resistantpeer-to-peer(P2P) digital payment system. Bitcoin's blockchain uses a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to verify and broadcast every transfer in the network. In Nakamoto's design, computers or nodes solve advanced algorithms every 10 minutes to get a chance to post new transactions on Bitcoin's payment ledger. Successful nodes even receive BTC rewards and transaction fees whenever they solve this puzzle. Other computers on the Bitcoin blockchain verify each transaction six times before posting data on the public payment ledger.Â

Nakamoto put their intricate PoW design into practice at the start of 2009 with the Bitcoin protocolâs release. In the early days, only Nakamoto and a few cryptography enthusiasts powered the BTC network, and it's estimated Nakamoto is thelargest BTC holderwith roughly $2 million BTC onmultiple wallets. The first recorded price for Bitcoin in cryptocurrency's history was approximately$0.00099 per coinin 2009 on the P2P trading platform BitcoinTalk. In 2010, the early crypto adopter Laszlo Hanyecz bought the first real-world item with Bitcoin when he traded 10,000 BTC for a Papa John's pizza. To this day, BTC fans host pizza parties every May 22 to commemorate Hanyecz's historic purchase.Â

Bitcoin started to grab mainstream attention in the early 2010s whenForbesâ reportersbegan covering the cryptocurrency. As stories on Bitcoin started circulating through the media, BTC's price began climbing until it almost cracked the $10 level in 2011. Bitcoin believers organized groups and published educational content to spread the word about cryptocurrency and capitalize on this momentum.
