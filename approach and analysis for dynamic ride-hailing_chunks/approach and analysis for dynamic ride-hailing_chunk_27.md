I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

During the transition from state 𝑠 to the following state 𝑠 + 1, the
time is updated depending on the event that triggers the next decision
epoch, the locations of the vehicles are updated with respect to the time
passed, and the set of pending requests is updated as well. Feasibly
assigned requests are removed from the set. Requests that have been
pending for more than 𝑇𝑁 seconds are automatically rejected and
removed from the set. Potential new requests are added. We seek to find a policy 𝜋 ∗ that maximizes the expected sum of
rewards earned during the time horizon, starting from an initial state
𝑠0 . The initial state 𝑠0 is determined at random with 𝑡 = 0, an empty
set of pending requests, and all vehicles in random parking lots with
no scheduled jobs. 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎) = 𝛼 ⋅ 𝑅𝑆𝑅 (𝑠, 𝑎) + 𝛽 ⋅ 𝑅𝑊 𝑇 (𝑠, 𝑎) + 𝛾 ⋅ 𝑅𝑅 (𝑠, 𝑎). Each action is given as a tuple 𝑎 = (𝑎𝑟 , 𝑎𝑣 ). Thereby, 𝑎𝑟 is also a tuple
representing the action related to each of the pending requests.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk appears to be describing the mechanics and objectives of a dynamic dispatch algorithm in ride-hailing systems.

**1. Technical details:**

* The context involves updating the time state based on events (e.g., new requests) and locations of vehicles, which is achieved through matrix operations.
* The set of pending requests is updated based on time and vehicle location updates.
* Requests are assigned a reward based on their status (e.g., whether they have been pending for a certain number of seconds).

**2. Connection to the surrounding context:**

This chunk builds upon the previous text, which discusses simulation and modeling approaches in ride-hailing systems. The dynamic dispatch algorithm is built upon this foundation by adding features such as:
* Time-dependent updates
* Location-based updates
* Reward assignment based on request status

The algorithm's objective is to maximize the expected sum of rewards earned during a given time horizon, starting from an initial state.

**3. Specific requirements or conditions:**

* The algorithm assumes an empty set of pending requests at initialization.
* Vehicles are randomly distributed across parking lots with no scheduled jobs.
* Actions (requests) are represented as tuples `a = (ar, av)` containing the request-related information and action tuple `(ar, av)` representing the specific action taken.

Overall, this text chunk is providing a detailed technical description of a dynamic dispatch algorithm in ride-hailing systems.
