**Original Text:**

In this paper, we face the design of such a
system in which users might be requested online to walk towards/from nearby pick-up/drop-off
points if this improves overall efficiency. We show theoretically that the general problem becomes
more complex (as it contains two sub-problems that extend set-cover), analyze the trade-offs that
emerge, and provide a general formulation and specific heuristics that are able to solve it over
large instances. We test this formulation over a real dataset of Manhattan taxi trips (9970 requests
during one hour), finding that (a) average walks of about one minute can reduce the number of
rejections in more than 80% and Vehicles-Hour-Traveled in more than 10%, (b) users who depart
or arrive at the most demanded areas are more likely to be required to walk, and (c) the perÂ­
formance improvement of the service is larger when the system receives more trip requests. 1.
