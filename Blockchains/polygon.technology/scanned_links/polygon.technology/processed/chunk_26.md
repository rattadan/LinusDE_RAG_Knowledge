# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_26.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://polygon.technology/*

### Document Overview  
This content outlines Polygon’s ecosystem, including their Chain Development Kit (CDK), decentralized applications (DApps), network infrastructure (PoS, zkEVM, Miden), and key products like Unstoppable Domains, Aragon, and Horizon. It emphasizes their role as a scalable, secure Web3 platform with focus on liquidity, governance, and developer tools.

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Polygon CDK**: Chain Development Kit for building ZK L2s (zero-knowledge layer 2) on Polygon, enabling unified liquidity.  
- **zkEVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine)**: A scalable, secure layer 2 solution for Ethereum, integrated into Polygon.  
- **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Polygon’s consensus mechanism, with live versions (PoSLive) and future plans for Miden.  
- **Unstoppable Domains**: Web3 domain management for identity and decentralized identity (DID) solutions.  
- **Aragon**: DAO platform for decentralized autonomous organizations on Polygon.  
- **Horizon**: All-in-one Web3 platform with developer tools, wallets, and security features.  
- **Phantom Wallet**: User-friendly wallet for NFTs, DeFi tokens, and cross-chain transactions.  

### Implementation Details  
- **CDK Live**: Features live deployment of ZK L2s, allowing users to launch scalable, privacy-preserving solutions.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - 28K+ nodes (Polygon network), 219.11M+ POL tokens, 2.44B+ ETH, 12.80B+ DApps, ~$0.015 in value.  
- **Networks**:  
  - **PoSLive**: Live PoS for Ethereum, with updates to zkEVM (Polygon zkEVM).  
  - **Miden**: Future release of Polygon’s scaling technology (Miden), aiming for high throughput.  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Governance**: Users can participate in blockchain governance via the "Govern" section.  
  - **Connect IRL**: Integration for real-world connections (e.g., Polkadot, Ethereum) via the "Connect IRL" section.  

### Related Topics  
- **"In the News"**: References updates to Polygon’s ecosystem, including CDK, zkEVM, and Miden.  
- **"Time to roll up your sleeves"**: Highlights key features like connecting to external networks, exploring POL, and building on Polygon.  
- **"Govern" and "Connect IRL"**: Linked to the "In the news" section, emphasizing governance and cross-chain interoperability.
