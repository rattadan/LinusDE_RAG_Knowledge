## Eureka - Chunk 7

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

We facilitate and operate the relaying infrastructure for Eureka for you. The IBC protocol guarantees that a packet delivered on the destination chain was definitely sent from the source chain, using cryptographic verification rather than trusted third parties. ​
Permissioned Relay
The initial rollout of IBC Eureka will use permissioned relayers for additional safety and security guarantees. The IBC light clients will be used in the same way as when IBC is permissionless, the permissioning only means that liveness is dependent on the permissioned relay set. Permissioning will be removed in the near future. ​

Types of Integrators
There are three types of integrators of Eureka:

Chain Developers - ensuring that your chain is compatible with Eureka and can facilitate the bridging of assets to and from other chains in the Eureka ecosystem.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides a technical analysis of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar General Messaging Protocol (GMP), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast.

Here's a breakdown of the specific technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk:

1. **Technical details:**
	* IBC protocol guarantees that packets delivered on one chain are definitely sent from the source chain using cryptographic verification.
	* Permissioned relay implementation involves permissioning only ensuring liveness is dependent on the permissioned relay set.
2. **Parameters and conditions:**
	* Timeout mechanisms in Hyperlane ensure user funds do not get lost due to transaction failures.
	* Short-term solutions include adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API, implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API for improved transaction success rates, and building better incentives for relayers to operate profitably.
3. **Context connections:**
	* This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by discussing potential failure points specific to each cross-chain asset transfer protocol mentioned (IBC, Axelar GMP, CCTP, Hyperlane, and Go Fast).
	* It provides recommendations and insights for developers and users to mitigate risks associated with these protocols.

This text chunk is explaining how specific technical details and parameters of the IBC protocol work. Specifically, it's discussing:

* How IBC guarantees packet delivery and verifies cryptographic integrity
* The implications of permissioning in IBC relay implementation
* Potential timeout mechanisms in Hyperlane for user fund preservation
* Short-term solutions to address potential issues

The chunk also connects to the broader context by providing an overview of potential failure points across various protocols, offering recommendations for mitigating risks.
