## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 26

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

It is important to note
that these SAV trips were modeled similar to current-day TNC demand. Fleet size was scaled up
proportional to the demand simulated to retain constant mode splits, and each SAV, on average,
made 56 person-trips per day, traveling about 319 mi per SAV per day. The heuristic employed
minimized response times to about 3.7 min, with a linearly decreasing trend as trip density
increased exponentially. Percent eVMT also fell by 3.6% (to 32.5%) and then 2.5% (to 30%) in
the 5x and 25x demand-density scenarios relative to the starting eVMT value of 36.1%. Employing DRS increased SAV mode shares by 2% (from 8% to 10%), or, in other words, was
able to meet demand that could not be met without DRS, and lowered system VMT by 3-7%. There was a 9.4% reduction in SAV VMT with DRS and with current Bloomington person-trip
densities, but was notably higher for higher trip densities with a reduction of up to 20.3%.

* Fleet size is scaled up proportionally to demand simulated to retain constant mode splits.

**Context Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by providing specific technical details related to shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) trips. It builds upon this context by describing the modeling approach, which involves simulating TNC demand using current-day TNC data. The chunk also provides additional insights into SAV trip characteristics, such as response times and mode shares.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

* There is no specific requirement mentioned in this text chunk.
* However, it's implied that the chunk assumes a certain level of background knowledge about shared autonomous vehicles, transportation systems, and statistical modeling techniques.
