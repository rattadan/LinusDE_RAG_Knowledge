## Eureka - Chunk 9

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

​
Asset Issuers
During the initial rollout of IBC Eureka, we will be working closely with asset issuers to ensure their tokens are bridged over and set up in the Skip Go API for application developers to support easily. If you’re an asset issuer looking to expand access to your token across different blockchains connected to the Eureka ecosystem, please reach out to Jeremy or Susannah so that we can help set you up! ​
Application Developers
If you’re an application developer looking to give your users access to Eureka assets in your UI or to leverage them within your protocol, integrating into the Eureka ecosystem via Skip Go is super simple! ​
New Skip Go Integrator
If you’re brand new to Skip Go, read about our cross-chain developer platform on the Getting Started page will be the best resource for you to get up to speed on the capabilities of Skip Go and the various integration options. For the quickest and easiest integration, you can integrate the Widget in minutes!

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols through specific technical details, parameters, or processes described.

The context provided for this section is a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. This includes discussing inter-blockchain communication protocols (IBC), Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast.

This chunk specifically connects to the surrounding context by:

1. Providing an overview of potential failure points across different protocols.
2. Highlighting specific technical details and parameters for each protocol, such as timeout mechanisms and token handling.
3. Connecting these failure points to broader risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers, including user education, risk management, and developer best practices.

The requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk are:

* Technical expertise: Developers need to understand the technical details of each protocol to identify potential failure points.
* User awareness: Users need to be informed about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
* Risk management: Protocols need robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

The text also outlines recommendations for developers, including:

1. Implementing user education and risk management practices.
2. Developing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.
