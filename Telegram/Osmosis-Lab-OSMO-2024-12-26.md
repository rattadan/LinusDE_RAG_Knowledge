## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the key points and decisions. The conversation seems to be around the Osmo token and some discussions about its price, supply, and governance.

Starting from the top, there are a few messages from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site and mentioning that tutorial commands are admin-only. Then griffin_web3 shares a link to guides. Not sure if those are crucial for the summary, but maybe mention the resources as part of the support.

The main discussion begins with user_343756695 talking about Osmo's fundamentals being strong at $5B but lacking market maker support. They suggest that if the team pumps the price, the market would see it as innovative. Then they mention the problem being demand, not high staking APR or token releases. They note 70% circulation and FDV not being too high. 

Another user, user_416517864, is more critical. They say Osmo 2.0 is a failure and propose moving to 3.0. They discuss tokenomics issues: tokens available for sale, staking, unminted tokens, and burn wallet transparency. They want increased burn rate and criticize Protorev's effectiveness. Also, they mention their own purchase and price drop (75% in a year, 96% from ATH). They ask about controlling minting and supply, implying concerns about management selling tokens.

jasbanza responds to some questions, explaining that token release is on a schedule with a 2/3rdening this year and 1/3rdening every 2 years, controlled by governance. They mention Protorev burns Osmo. BasementNodes and IR09K touch on other topics like Thor chain integration and treasury wallet control.

cryptologer0 asks about a top project on an AI agent, which might be a separate query but included in the text.

So key points are:
1. Osmo's price decline and concerns about demand vs. fundamentals.
2. Tokenomics discussions: supply growth, staking rewards, burn rate, transparency on token availability.
3. User suggestions to increase burn rate, adjust token release, and move to Osmo 3.0.
4. Governance role in controlling token supply through proposals.
5. Mention of Prot

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string.

First, I'll read through all the messages to understand the context. The chat seems to be about the Osmo cryptocurrency, specifically discussions around its tokenomics, price, and governance. There's mention of support sites, guides, and some technical terms like FDV (Fully Diluted Value), staking APR, burns, and token releases.

Looking at the messages from user_343756695, they talk about fundamentals vs. price action, market makers, narratives like Bitcoin bridge and Polaris, demand issues, staking rewards, and circulating supply. Another user, user_416517864, is concerned about the supply growing faster than demand, the burn rate, treasury wallet control, and price drops. There's also a mention of Osmo 2.0 being a failure and moving to Osmo 3.0. Protorev's matches being wet and governance proposals come up too.

I need to identify recurring themes. Tokenomics is a big one here, covering staking rewards, token release schedules, burn rates, and supply vs. demand. Price action and market performance are discussed multiple times, including the 75% drop in a year and 96% from the all-time high. Governance and token management are mentioned regarding controlling the minting and treasury wallets. Future development with Osmo 3.0 and narratives like the Bitcoin bridge and Polaris. Support resources like the official site and guides. Technical aspects like Protorev and free float. Lastly, there's a mention of Thor chain (RUNE) integration.

I should compile these into a list without repeating similar topics. For example, tokenomics can include staking, burns, supply, and release schedules. Market performance covers the price drops. Governance includes control via proposals. Future developments include Osmo 3.0 and the mentioned narratives. Support resources are the links provided. Technical issues like Protorev and free float. And the Thor chain question is a separate topic.

Let me make sure I didn't miss any key points. The main topics seem to be: Osmo tokenomics, price action, market performance, governance, token management, future development (Osmo 3.0), Bitcoin bridge, Polaris,

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different users and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The first few are from osmosis_statbot and griffin_web3, just sharing support links and guides. Those seem neutral because they're informational without any emotional language.

Then there's a message from osmosis_statbot about tutorial commands being restricted to admins. Still neutral, just a statement of fact. 

Next, user_343756695 has some comments. The first one talks about $osmo having a $5B fundamental but lack of price action. That sounds a bit negative because they're pointing out a problem. Then they mention narratives and pumping the price, which could be positive if the team does it, but the user is critical of the current situation. They also say the problem is demand, which is a negative point. Another message from them says the price isn't going up, which is clearly negative.

User_416517864 starts with calling Osmo 2.0 a failure. That's definitely negative. They discuss token supply, staking rewards, and price drops‚Äî75% in a year and 96% since the all-time high. All these are negative sentiments. They also mention concerns about management selling tokens, which adds to the negative tone.

Other messages from jasbanza and BasementNodes are about governance and token release schedules. These are more factual or questions, so neutral. IR09K asks about Thor chain being tradeable, which is a neutral inquiry. cryptologer0 asks if it's a top project on AI agent, which might be slightly positive but it's a question, so maybe neutral.

Putting it all together, the majority of the user messages are pointing out issues: price drops, failure of Osmo 2.0, high supply growth, and concerns about token management. The bot messages are neutral. So the overall sentiment here is negative. The positive or neutral parts don't outweigh the negative comments.
</think>

The sentiment of this text is **negative**. 

### Key reasons:  
1. **User concerns about price decline**:  
   - Mentions of a "75% drop in the past year" and "96% since all-time high"

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll need to go through each message carefully and identify any parts that suggest something needs to be done, a decision made, or a next step taken.

Starting from the top, the first few messages from osmosis_statbot are about directing users to the support site and mentioning that tutorial commands are restricted to admins. Those don't seem like action items for the team but rather informational messages. Then there's griffin_web3 sharing guides, which is a resource but not an action item.

Looking at user_343756695's messages, they discuss the token's fundamentals and price action. They mention the team working to pump up the price, but that's more of an opinion or suggestion rather than a concrete action item. However, their points about demand being the problem might be a consideration for the team, though not a direct action item.

User_416517864 has several messages. They talk about the token supply growing faster than demand, price drops, and questions about who controls minting and the treasury wallet. These are concerns but not action items unless someone is tasked to address them. Then they suggest increasing the burn rate and subtracting data on tokens available for sale. They also mention posting daily data on the burn wallet. These are specific requests or suggestions that could be action items if the team decides to act on them.

jasbanza responds to some of these, explaining the token release schedule and that Osmo 2.0 had proposals for adjustments. The mention of governance proposals could imply that future adjustments might be considered through governance, which is a process but not an immediate action item.

BasementNodes says "A major one," which is vague. IR09K asks about Thor chain being tradeable, which might be a question needing a response but not an action item unless there's a plan to add it.

cryptologer0's message about the top project on AI agent is unclear but might be a suggestion or question. If the team is considering AI agents, that could be a next step, but the message itself is just a question.

Putting this all together, the main action items seem to come from user_416517864's suggestions: increasing the burn rate, providing data on tokens available for sale
