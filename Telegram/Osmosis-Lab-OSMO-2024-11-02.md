## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to read through the messages and understand what's going on.

Looking at the timestamps, the conversation starts with tomas_ddd asking for help. He says he swapped Atom to Osmo and withdrew from Osmosis but can't find it in his Keplr wallet. Then Khuwarzmi responds by telling him to deposit Atom to Osmosis using the Assets page and then swap. Next, tomas_ddd says he already did that but doesn't have Osmo in his wallet. Khuwarzmi then asks him to send his Osmo address. Finally, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing to the support site.

So the key points here are: tomas_ddd is having trouble finding his Osmo after a swap and withdrawal. The support messages from Khuwarzmi and the bot are guiding him to deposit Atom, swap, and provide his address for further help. The decisions involved are the steps taken by the support team to resolve his issue. I need to make sure the summary includes his problem, the steps suggested, and the request for his address. Also, mention the support site link. Avoid any extra details, just the main issues and actions. Let me structure that clearly and concisely.
</think>

**Summary:**  
User tomas_ddd reported an issue where OSMO tokens swapped from ATOM and withdrawn from Osmosis are missing in their Keplr wallet. Support (Khuwarzmi) instructed them to:

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and present them as a comma-separated list.

First, I'll read through each message to understand the context. The first message is from osmosis_statbot providing a link to the support site. That seems like a support resource, so the main topic here is probably "support site" or "official support."

Next, Khuwarzmi asks for someone's Osmo address. "Osmo address" is a key term here. Then tomas_ddd mentions not having Osmo in their wallet after doing something, which points to "Osmo wallet issue" or "missing Osmo in wallet." 

Khuwarzmi again talks about depositing Atom to Osmosis via the Assets page and swapping. So topics here might be "depositing Atom to Osmosis" and "swapping tokens." 

The last message from tomas_ddd explains they swapped Atom to Osmo and withdrew from Osmosis but can't find it in their Keplr wallet. That brings up "swapping Atom to Osmo," "withdrawal from Osmosis," and "Keplr wallet issue."

I need to make sure I'm not repeating topics. Let's list all possible ones and then deduplicate. The main topics seem to be:

- Official support site (from the first message)
- Osmo address request (Khuwarzmi's second message)
- Missing Osmo in wallet (tomas_ddd's issue)
- Depositing Atom to Osmosis (Khuwarzmi's advice)
- Swapping tokens (mentioned in both Khuwarzmi's and tomas_ddd's messages)
- Withdrawal from Osmosis (tomas_ddd's action)
- Keplr wallet issue (where the swapped tokens aren't showing up)

I should check if "swapping tokens" and "swapping Atom to Osmo" are the same. Since the context is swapping Atom specifically, maybe "swapping Atom to Osmo" is more precise. But "swapping tokens" could be a broader category. However, since the text specifically mentions Atom to Osmo, it's better to include that exact phrase.

Also, "Osmo" and "Osmosis" are related but Osmo is the token, Osmosis is the platform. So

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- support (3 mentions)
- osmosis (3 mentions)
- osmo (3 mentions)
- can (3 mentions)
- help (2 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to analyze the sentiment of this chat text. The user messages are from tomas_ddd and Khuwarzmi, with a bot message at the top. The options are positive, negative, or neutral.

First, looking at the bot message: "If you need help, visit our official support site..." That's probably neutral because it's just providing support information without any emotional tone.

Then Khuwarzmi says, "Please send me your Osmo address." Hmm, this could be part of a support process, maybe someone is asking for help with a transaction. The sentiment here isn't clearly positive or negative. It's a request, so maybe neutral.

Next, tomas_ddd replies, "I already did this, but now I don't have osmo in my wallet." This sounds negative. They're indicating that after following some steps, they lost their OSMO, so they're frustrated or upset.

Khuwarzmi then says, "Hi please deposit your Atom to Osmosis using Assets page and then you can swap." Again, this is instructional, guiding someone through a process. Neutral, as it's just providing information.

Finally, tomas_ddd's initial message: "Hey guys, I swap atom to osmo and withdraw from osmosis, but can't find in my keplr, can someone help me pls?" This is a cry for help because they can't find their funds. Definitely negative sentiment here because they're experiencing an issue and are worried about missing coins.

Putting it all together, the user tomas_ddd is expressing negative emotions due to a problem with their transaction. The other messages are neutral. Since the user's messages are negative, the overall sentiment of the conversation is negative.
</think>

The sentiment of the text is **negative**.  

- **tomas_ddd** expresses frustration or concern about missing OSMO tokens after a transaction and seeks help, indicating a problem.  
- The other messages (from **Khuwarzmi** and the bot) are neutral, providing instructions or support links, but the user's issue dominates the tone.  

Final sentiment: **Negative**.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I'll read through the messages to understand the conversation.

The user tomas_ddd says they swapped Atom to Osmo and withdrew from Osmosis but can't find it in their Keplr wallet. They're asking for help. Then Khuwarzmi tells them to deposit Atom to Osmosis using the Assets page and then they can swap. But tomas_ddd replies that they already did that and now don't have Osmo in their wallet. The last message from Khuwarzmi is asking for their Osmo address.

So, looking for action items: Khuwarzmi is guiding tomas_ddd through steps. The first step mentioned is depositing Atom to Osmosis via the Assets page. Then swapping. Then when the problem persists, they ask for the Osmo address. 

Decisions might be that tomas_ddd needs to provide their address for further help. Next steps could be depositing, swapping, and then sharing the address. The support site link is an action item from the bot, but it's a general one. 

I need to list each action item clearly. Maybe the user needs to deposit, then swap, and then provide the address. The bot's message is a suggestion to visit the support site, which could be an action item if someone needs help beyond the chat. 

Wait, but the user already did the deposit and swap steps, so maybe the next step is to provide the address so Khuwarzmi can check. Also, the support site is an ongoing resource. 

So the action items would be:

1. Khuwarzmi asks tomas_ddd to deposit Atom to Osmosis using the Assets page.
2. Then, swap Atom to Osmo.
3. Then, provide the Osmo address.
4. The bot suggests visiting the support site if further help is needed.

Decisions: The user needs to follow these steps to resolve the issue. The next steps are the actions they need to take. 

I should structure this as a list of action items, decisions, and next steps. Maybe each message that contains an instruction is an action item. The support site is a resource, so that's an action item as well. 

Wait, the user already did the deposit and swap but still has an issue
