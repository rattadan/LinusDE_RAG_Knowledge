**Original Text:**

The alighting model reveals that unloading bulky luggage significantly contributes to
longer stop times, evidenced by a statistically significant coefficient of 27.50 s for the variable xBag . The continuous variable xPax (Passengers) also shows high statistical significance,
indicating that each passenger requires an additional 3.28 s to leave the vehicle, on top of
a basic stop time of approximately 16.66 s (intercept). Consistent with the boarding model,
the variable xSen (Senior) has a positive, but not significant impact, while the variable xVir
(Virtual stop) exhibits a more significant but less pronounced negative impact on stop times
compared to the boarding model. Cumulative distribution
We analysed separate stop time distributions for boarding and alighting. The pairwise KStest was used to assess the goodness of fit between the cumulative probability of the
empirical data and different continuous CDFs.
