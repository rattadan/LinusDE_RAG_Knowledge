## Chunk 43

**Original Text:**

Call a contract on a remote chain after purchasing a cw20 asset (e.g. since this requires an IBC transfer under the hood)
Chain 1 is the origin chain, where the token can be used freely for post-route actions, but it cannot be used in post-route actions on other chains. Chain 1 is the origin chain, where the token can be used freely for post-route actions, but it cannot be used in post-route actions on other chains. IBC transfer from a remote chain to the CW20â€™s origin chain then perform a swap or any other post-route action on that chain
Chain 2 is the origin chain. The token can be transferred back there, but it can't be used or swapped for anything in the same transaction.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

So you want to set up an on-chain / off-chain interaction between two different chains (a "remote chain" and a "CW20's origin chain") using Inter-Chain Communication (ICC) techniques, specifically with the goal of enabling an IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) transfer from a remote chain to CW20's origin chain. 

Here's a general outline of how you could set this up:

**Remote Chain to CW20 Origin Chain**

1.  You create a contract on CW20's origin chain that performs an IBC transfer from the remote chain.
2.  Once the IBC transfer is initiated, the remote chain uses its native token for post-route actions and can't use it in any other transaction on CW20.

**CW20 Origin Chain to Remote Chain**

1.  The contract you created above is deployed on CW20's origin chain as well.
2.  This contract will be used to receive IBC transfer requests from the remote chain, perform the necessary checks (e.g., token ownership, valid destination), and then execute the post-route action.

**Post-Route Action**

1.  The contract on CW20 performs a specific post-route action (e.g., swap tokens) using the received IBC transfer request.
2.  This action can now be used in conjunction with other transactions on the remote chain, allowing for seamless interaction between the two chains.

Here's some sample code to illustrate this concept:
