* The second and third tweets are responses to quotes about starting something new (beginning) and persevering through challenges (doing something you've never done). They also share more inspirational messages, such as Thomas Jefferson's quote on planting trees for others to enjoy.

The fourth tweet is likely from a user who shares a similar message about the importance of taking action, but with a different twist.
