## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I need to go through each message and identify the main topics and any decisions made.

Starting from the top, Ajcrypto456 is asking about the supreme leader @keyleu and making a joke about his portfolio being Cosmos coins. Then there's a discussion between BasementNodes and others about pump and dumps, shorting, and whale rotation. BasementNodes has a theory that alts pump during short liquidation events, not because of whale rotation. He also mentions Luna and Domains, saying when Luna pumps, there won't be a dump for a long time.

There's a mention of Cosmos Voice #10, an event hosted by DAODISEO with Reece Williams from Layer Labs discussing WAVS and AVS infrastructure. The event was scheduled for June 28, 2025, at 15:00 UTC. People are excited about it, with several messages promoting the event and thanking participants after.

Nicolas_Boulay announces that Luncverse's #Cookie is live on Cosmostation's GameFi tabs. Lunaticlunalover69 talks about the USTC staking system, launching governance and staking contracts before mainnet, and incremental rollouts for features like lending pools. They also mention the community's achievements despite low funding.

Other topics include discussions about NFT avatars and spheres from posthuman.digital, some skepticism about trusting operators who aren't validators, and a few off-topic messages like someone asking about a t-shirt or Litecoin. There's a bot banning a user, and some general chat about market conditions.

Key points are the Cosmos Voice event, BasementNodes' theories on market dynamics, Luncverse developments, USTC staking, NFT projects, and community discussions around trust and technical fundamentals. Decisions include scheduling the event, launching #Cookie on Cosmostation, incremental feature releases, and the staking system proposal.

I need to condense all this without the casual banter. Focus on the main projects, announcements, theories, and decisions. Make sure to mention the stakeholders involved and the outcomes or next steps. Avoid the jokes and side comments unless they relate to a key point. Also, note the concerns about tokenomics and governance sustainability raised by Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot and others. Highlight the community's effort despite limited resources.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or specific subjects that are discussed.

Starting with the first few messages, there's a mention of "@keyleu" and someone being an Admin for 3 years, holding COSMOS coins. That seems to relate to Cosmos ecosystem and possibly leadership or admin roles. Then, there's a question about "modding Sei" which refers to a blockchain project within the Cosmos network. So topics here might include Cosmos, Sei, and maybe leadership.

Next, BasementNodes talks about pump and dumps, memes vs. alts, DEX, Solana, shorting, and whales. These are all cryptocurrency trading and market dynamics topics. Terms like "LUNA" and "short liquidation events" come up, which are specific tokens and market events. Also, "tokenomics" and "decentralization" are mentioned, which are important in crypto projects.

Looking at other messages, there's a mention of "Luncverse" and its Layer 2 currency "#Cookie". This indicates a specific project and its components. There's also a roadmap for NFT-avatars and discussions about WAVS and AVS infrastructure, which are part of the Cosmos ecosystem. The event "Cosmos Voice #10" with speakers from Layer Labs and DAODISEO suggests events or discussions within the Cosmos community.

Some messages talk about USTC staking systems on Terra Classic, governance contracts, and technical fundamentals. These relate to Terra Classic, staking, governance, and blockchain infrastructure. There's also a link to a Twitter post about Cosmos Ecosystem news from two years ago, mentioning various tokens like AURA, BTSG, etc., so maybe historical context or news.

Other topics include NFTs, specifically NFT-avatars and NFTgang, which are part of the Cosmos NFT space. There's a mention of a scamdefender bot and advertising postings, which might relate to community management or moderation tools. Also, technical terms like "precompile design philosophy" and "composability between lending pools" point to blockchain development aspects.

The user might be interested in tracking discussions around Cosmos projects, their tokens, market behaviors, community governance, and upcoming events. I should ensure that all specific project names (like L

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

The text is a series of chat messages from different users, mostly discussing cryptocurrency topics like Cosmos, LUNC, Terra Classic, and some projects like WAVS and Luncverse. There are mentions of technical aspects, staking, NFTs, and market dynamics.

Looking at the first few messages from Ajcrypto456, there's a mention of pity for @keyleu and a joke about his portfolio being all COSMOS coins with a üòû emoji. That seems negative. Then, there's a question to @BasementNodes about modding Sei, which is neutral. 

BasementNodes has several messages discussing pump and dumps, shorting, and whale rotations. He uses phrases like "classic buy and sell," "inversed greed," and "my theory is that alts pump during short liquidation events." These are analytical and neutral in sentiment. 

Another user, iconoicono, asks "is it shitcoin season?" which is a bit negative. Then there's a message from keyleu saying "Diarrhea season," which is probably a slang term for a bad period in the market, so negative. 

There are multiple positive messages from users like Nicolas_Boulay promoting Luncverse and #Cookie, using emojis like üëë and ü´°, which are positive. Dr0By and others express excitement with phrases like "So promising! I love it!" and "Thank you, friends..." which are positive. 

Some messages are announcements about events, meetings, or roadmaps, which are neutral. Others mention technical discussions about tokenomics, governance, and infrastructure, which are neutral or positive depending on context. 

There's a message from lunaticlunalover69 comparing their project's achievements to others with a budget of 500M+, using üòÇ and "let that sink in," which seems positive but maybe sarcastic. 

The user Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot has a few questions about tokenomics and technical fundamentals, which are neutral. 

MissRose_bot's message about banning someone is negative but factual. 

Then there's a mix of other messages: some neutral (like event reminders), some positive (excitement about calls, future developments), and some negative (terms like "shitcoin," "

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I need to read through all the messages and identify any tasks or plans mentioned. 

Starting from the top, Ajcrypto456 is asking about the supreme leader @keyleu and making a joke about his portfolio. Not sure if there's an action item there, maybe not. Then there's a message from BasementNodes discussing pump and dumps, shorting, and whales. That seems more like analysis or opinion, not a specific action.

Looking further down, there's a message about a video meeting for Cosmos Voice #10 with Reece Williams. The time and agenda are mentioned. The next step here might be attending the meeting or setting a reminder. The link is provided, so maybe that's an action item.

Another part mentions the #Cookie token being live on Cosmostation. Nicolas_Boulay posts about that, so maybe the action is to check it out or use it there. 

Then there's a user talking about USTC staking system proposal. The link is provided, so maybe the action is to review the proposal or participate in staking discussions.

There's also a mention of NFT-avatars and a roadmap link. The action could be checking the roadmap or joining the linked Telegram chat for more info.

Lunaticlunalover69 mentions testnet lending pools coming in a couple of days and incremental rollouts. So possible action items here are testing the lending pools when available and preparing for upcoming features.

Another user talks about modifying a bot to count advertising postings. That's a specific task someone is planning to do, so that's an action item.

I should also check for any decisions made, like launching a feature, starting an audit, or confirming partnerships. For example, the testnet rollout and audit mentioned by lunaticlunalover69, or the bot modification by Rattadan.

I need to make sure I don't miss any deadlines or reminders, like the Cosmos Voice meeting at 15:00 UTC. Also, the NFT distribution model and eligibility list might require users to check the addresses or participate in the drop.

So compiling all these, the action items would be things to do, next steps would be upcoming events or features, and decisions are the commitments made by users or projects. I'll list them out clearly, referencing the relevant parts of the text
