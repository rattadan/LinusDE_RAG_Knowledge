I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

When delayed responses are
allowed, often variants of matching problems are solved to assign
the gathered open requests to the available vehicles. The objective
functions used in the matching can include, e.g., the service rate, the
waiting time, or driving costs (Hyland and Mahmassani, 2018; Maciejewski et al., 2016; Lyu et al., 2019). In Miao et al. (2016), fairness
regarding similar service rates in different parts of the service area is
also incorporated in the matching. Gao et al. (2016) consider additional
assignment constraints due to heterogeneous vehicles and customer
preferences. Qin et al. (2021) use a common matching approach as
well, but learn a dynamic time interval between the matchings with
reinforcement learning. Shi et al. (2021) and Xu et al. (2018) learn
the cost matrix of the matching problem. By that, it can be taken into
account that vehicles are differently profitable in different parts of the
service area. Alonso-Mora et al. (2017) and Wallar et al.
