Now, I'll generate 5 matching keywords/tags based on the analysis:
- Cryptocurrency
- Bitcoin
- $DOG (though this is specific to their account)
- Technical Analysis
- Financial Independence/System Change

Let me think about whether "Dog" refers to Dogecoin ($DOGE), but the tweet specifically uses $Dog with that exact spelling, so it's probably a different token.

Based on these tweets, the keywords/tags that would help with postprocessing would include:
- Cryptocurrency
- Bitcoin
- $DOG
- TechnicalAnalysis
- FinancialFreedom
