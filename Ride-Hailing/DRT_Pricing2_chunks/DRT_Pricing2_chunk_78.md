## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 78

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

The combination (30 s, 30 s)
outperformed the nearest strategy as well by 0.5%, but only for ùëâ =
300, ùê∑ùëÜùëÖ = 100, and ùëáùëä = 1029. Without limiting the waiting time,
delayed responses can slightly outperform the immediate response of
the nearest strategy for ùëâ = 30. The bigger the fleet, the longer the
delay must be to gain a benefit. For the ùëâ = 300 fleet, it is necessary
to allow a response delay of 120 s to even match the quality of the
nearest strategy. To summarize, while matching-based approaches can
outperform the nearest strategy significantly in highly utilized fleets
where customers are willing to wait a moderate amount of time, this
benefit mostly vanishes (and can even get negative) when the service
provider has to ensure a quick response. Are there any economies of scale in terms of fleet size? If there
were no economies of scale in terms of fleet size, the service rates and
the waiting times should be similar for different fleet sizes since we
scale the demand according to the number of vehicles.
