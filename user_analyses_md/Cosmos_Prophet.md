4. Which Ecosystem or project the account advertises:

Putting the tweets in context of intentions:
The tweets suggest someone who is trying to build connections and be supportive within their network. They seem interested in encouraging others' creative endeavors and possibly scouting for interesting projects, though they aren't explicitly promoting anything themselves. The expression of gratitude indicates someone who is reflective and appreciative of the positive aspects they observe in their community.

The account name "Cosmos_Prophet" suggests they might be interested in or focused on the Cosmos ecosystem, which is a blockchain platform focused on creating an interconnected ecosystem of blockchains, but this isn't explicitly confirmed in the provided tweets. Cosmos has several projects within its ecosystem, so without more specific information, I can't identify a particular project they're promoting.
