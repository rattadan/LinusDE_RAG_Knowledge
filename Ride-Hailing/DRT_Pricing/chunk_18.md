user prices which may boost the demand for such innovative on-demand mobility services. Operators of on-demand
mobility services need guidance on how to change their today’s service in order to increase their profit, increase the
number of DRT users or reach a predefined level of service quality. In contrast, municipalities may need guidance on
how to regulate the existing DRT services in order to improve overall system welfare or follow a political agenda, e.g. a modal shift from private cars to environmental friendlier modes.

The text you provided appears to be an abstract or introduction to a research paper in the field of public transportation and mobility services. It discusses the challenges that on-demand mobility service providers face in terms of increasing demand, improving service quality, and balancing competing interests.

In this context, "user prices" could refer to various factors that affect the willingness of users to pay for a particular transportation service or mode of transport. Some possible user prices that may boost demand include:

1. Increased funding for road maintenance and infrastructure improvements, which could make driving more affordable and attractive.
2. Introduction of toll-free zones or free travel options in certain areas, making public transportation a more viable option.
3. Investment in smart traffic management systems, reducing congestion and making journeys faster and more efficient.
4. Development of new, innovative modes of transport, such as electric or self-driving vehicles, which could offer improved comfort, convenience, and sustainability.

On the other hand, municipalities may consider using "user prices" to implement policies that promote a shift away from private car use towards more environmentally friendly modes of transport. Some possible user prices that could achieve this goal include:

1. Congestion charges or low-emission zones for vehicles operating in urban areas.
2. Mandatory public transportation usage requirements for certain segments of the population, such as seniors or low-income individuals.
3. Taxation on private vehicle ownership or registration fees, which could be used to fund public transportation infrastructure.

It's worth noting that these are just hypothetical examples and the actual use of "user prices" would depend on the specific context and goals of the municipalities or service providers.
