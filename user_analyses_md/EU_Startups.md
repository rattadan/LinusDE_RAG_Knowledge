The tweet about 3DSpark mentions their location in Hamburg, Germany, which is a significant market for manufacturing and procurement technology. Their expansion into Europe also implies that they're looking to scale and grow beyond their local market.

The tweet about Skillvue mentions Milan as their base, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact role of Milan in their business. However, if they're a leader in HR-related technologies for companies across Europe, Milan could be an important location for them to expand into.
