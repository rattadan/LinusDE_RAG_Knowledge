**Original Text:**

Applying the provided parameters for the scale and shape of the CDF
allows for a more accurate representation of ridepooling stop times, particularly in simulation models, as cases of prolonged stop durations (e.g. due to bulky luggage or unpunctual
passengers) are also included. Our findings hold significant relevance for researchers and providers in the field of DRT
systems, as they enable considerably more accurate temporal predictions for trips that
incorporate realistic stop times for PUDO events. Future simulation studies can either use
our median stop time as a fix duration of 21 s for each PUDO event, or, for greater accuracy, assign an individual stop time to each PUDO event based on key determinants or by
applying the provided CDFs for the distribution of stop times. As demonstrated (Lotze et al. 2023a; Zwick and Axhausen 2020b), the duration of a PUDO event is a critical factor influencing the efficiency of the system, and understanding these durations can aid in optimising
the service.
