## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of Discord messages from different users discussing issues related to Osmosis, Keplr, Leap, and other blockchain stuff.

First, I'll scan through each message to identify the main topics. There's a link to the Osmosis Discord and support site. Users are having problems with price discrepancies between Osmosis and CoinGecko, especially with $baby tokens. Some mention issues with deposits and transactions on Keplr versus Leap. There's a specific error code 8 related to public key mismatches. 

Then there's a workaround suggested: force updating Keplr to version 0.12.223, using specific RPC endpoints for Comdex, and using crosschain send functions. Also, mentions of using Leap for deposits when Keplr isn't working. 

Discussions about IBC transfers, Eureka integration, and a forum thread for adding eth.hub to alloyed assets. Some users note that certain features are working for some but not others, indicating inconsistency. 

The support site is mentioned multiple times. The main decisions or actions here are the troubleshooting steps provided by Kamal_Maquina and JohnnyWyles87, like updating Keplr, changing endpoints, and using alternative methods like SquidRouter. Also, the forum link for further discussion on adding assets.

I need to structure this into key points: price issues, deposit problems with Keplr vs Leap, error code 8, workarounds (version update, RPC changes), IBC/Eureka status, and support resources. Avoid minor details unless they're part of the solutions. Make sure to highlight the main issues and the steps users are taking to resolve them.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Price Discrepancies:** Users noted Osmosis displaying incorrect token prices (e.g., $baby reflecting lower values vs. CoinGecko), resolved after restarting apps/phones.  
2. **Deposit Issues:**  
   - Keplr wallet had errors (code 8: "pubKey does not match signer address") for Initia‚ÜíOsmosis deposits, while Leap wallet worked for some.  
   - Workarounds: Force update Keplr to 0.12.223, use crosschain send function, or SquidRouter for BTC transfers.  
3. **RPC

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring or significant themes.

Starting with the first few messages, there's a mention of the Osmosis Discord page and a link to a Discord server. Then, someone asks about a Discord link, so that's a topic. There's a question about a price discrepancy between Osmosis and CoinGecko for $baby, which points to price data issues. 

Another user mentions problems with Keplr and Leap, specifically deposit issues. There's a discussion about using Leap versus Keplr, with some users having trouble with one but not the other. Then, there's a technical error message about a public key not matching, which is related to transaction failures. 

Looking further, there's a lot about transferring tokens between chains, like INIT to Osmosis, using bridges, and RPC endpoints. Some users are having issues with IBC transfers, especially from Initia to Osmosis. There's a mention of a support site and troubleshooting steps for Keplr, suggesting support and technical issues. 

Also, there are links to forums and Twitter posts, indicating community discussions and official announcements. The topic of oracles being off comes up, which relates to data accuracy. Additionally, there's a mention of a blockchain being inactive but still producing blocks, which might be about network status. 

I should group these into topics like Discord, Price Quotes, Keplr, Leap Dashboard, Transaction Errors, IBC Transfers, Support Site, RPC Endpoints, Oracles, Network Status, and Community Announcements. Need to make sure each topic is distinct and covers the main points without overlapping too much. Let me check again to see if I missed anything. Oh, there's also something about a bridge on Initia and connection to Osmosis, which falls under IBC Transfers. And the part about manually updating Keplr's version is part of troubleshooting, so under Support maybe. 

Wait, the user might want specific terms like "price quotes" or "oracles" as separate topics. Also, the mention of specific tokens like $baby and platforms like CoinGecko, Keplr, Leap, SquidRouter, and Eureka. But the user said "main topics," so maybe the platforms themselves are topics. 

So compiling all these, the main

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of Discord messages related to Osmosis and some issues people are having. First, I need to go through each message and figure out if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the earliest messages. The first few are from osmosis_statbot and osmosis_news sharing links. Those are probably neutral since they're just providing information. Then there's Yusungsang sharing a link, which might be neutral too. 

Looking at the messages around 2025-04-24T11:37:50 and onwards, profesija is having issues with Keplr, getting errors when trying to deposit. Words like "Broadcasting transaction failed" and "Cannot deposit init" sound negative. JohnnyWyles87 mentions errors and that deposits from Initia to Osmosis are spotty, which is also negative. 

But then profesija says "leap works great" which is positive. However, they also mention issues with Keplr. There's a mix here. Other messages talk about workarounds like updating Keplr versions or using specific RPCs, which might indicate frustration but also problem-solving. 

The user_6352038770 mentions strange numbers on their screen but it's fixed after restarting the phone. That's a negative experience but resolved, so maybe neutral? Not sure. 

Messages about Comdex not responding and tokens not showing up are negative. DarkBoy1972 says they succeeded but there are many problems, which is negative. 

Then there's a discussion about adding assets via a forum link, which is more neutral or positive if they're working on solutions. 

Overall, the main sentiment seems to be negative because of the recurring issues with deposits, errors, and lack of response from teams. However, some users are providing solutions or workarounds, which might be positive. But the majority of the complaints are about problems they're facing, so the overall sentiment is likely negative.
</think>

The sentiment of this text is **negative**. 

### Key Reasons:  
1. **Technical Issues & Frustration**: Multiple users report problems with deposits, price data discrepancies, and wallet functionality (e.g., "Broadcasting transaction failed," "Keplr is good now tho" after prior issues, "Leap app not working").  
2. **Oracles/Price

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. The user provided a bunch of messages from different people, and I need to go through each one to see if there's anything that needs to be done, a decision made, or a next step mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first message is from mikebarb asking about the Osmosis Discord page. Then another message from him providing a Discord link. Then ronnyu3 asks for the Discord link, which was already given. So maybe the action item here is to share the Discord link, but since it's already provided, maybe not. Then there's some discussion about price discrepancies between Osmosis and CoinGecko, with users mentioning restarting the app or phone. For example, user_6352038770 says they restarted their phone and it fixed the issue. So maybe an action item is to restart the app or phone if experiencing price issues.

Then there's a mention of using the SquidRouter link for transferring BTC from OKX to Kepler. But I'm not sure if that's a decision or a next step. The user_1746142216 is asking about sending BTC from OKX to Kepler, and griffin_web3 provides a link. So maybe the next step is to use that router for transfers.

Looking further down, there's a support link from osmosis_statbot. That's a resource, not an action item. Then profesija is having trouble depositing with Keplr but Leap works. JohnnyWyles87 suggests some workarounds: force updating Keplr to 0.12.223, using the in-wallet crosschain send function. So action items here would be to update Keplr, try crosschain send. Kamal_Maquina provides a link to Keplr troubleshooting guidelines, which is another resource.

Then there's an error message from profesija about pubKey not matching, which JohnnyWyles87 acknowledges and mentions it's an Osmosis FE issue. No specific action mentioned there except maybe being aware of the issue. 

JohnnyWyles87 also mentions that deposits from Initia to Osmosis are spotty and they're working on it. So next steps might include monitoring the issue or using alternative methods like manual transfers. 

Another part is DarkBoy19
