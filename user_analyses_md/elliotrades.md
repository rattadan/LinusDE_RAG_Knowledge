# User Analysis: elliotrades

## Overview

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze these tweets according to the given points. Let's start with the first tweet: "Don't say it" with a like action. That's pretty cryptic, maybe inside joke or referencing something without details. The user might be teasing followers to engage.

Second tweet is longer. Talks about news cycle vs. market, alts going to zero bid and then turbo. Mentions "SUPER CYCLE". This seems to focus on cryptocurrency markets, advising people to follow the market instead of news. The tone is reflective, maybe a lesson learned. Uses slang like "TURBO" and "ZERO bid", which is common in crypto trading communities. Elliotrades is emphasizing market trends over external news, suggesting a strong belief in market sentiment. The phrase "market is screaming" indicates an emotional response to market movements.

Third tweet is a retweet with a quote about making money in crypto changing one's view of the world. The original author is Zqinfo1, but Elliotrades is sharing this. This supports the theme of crypto's transformative impact, possibly aligning with their own experience.

Main topics: Cryptocurrency market dynamics, advice to ignore news in favor of market signals, the concept of a "super cycle", and personal experiences in trading. Language is informal, uses all caps for emphasis, and slang typical of crypto enthusiasts. The tone is confident, assertive, maybe a bit preachy. The user is positioning themselves as someone with market insight.

Legitimacy evaluation: The content is speculative and promotional, typical of social media influencers in crypto. They might be trying to build a following by sharing supposed insights. No concrete evidence of expertise, just personal anecdotes. So, not very credible but common in that space.

Ecosystem/project: They mention "alts" which refers to alternative cryptocurrencies (not Bitcoin). The "SUPER CYCLE" could relate to market hype cycles, maybe promoting altcoin trading. The account might be associated with altcoin projects, but no specific one is named here.

Author's character: Personality traits include confidence, impulsiveness (prioritizing market over news), and a tendency to share dramatic experiences. Their motivation might be to gain followers or promote their own trading strategies. They value market intuition over external analysis. Emotionally, they react strongly to market changes, using words like "screaming" and "mistake". Decision-making seems reactive, relying on market trends rather than planned strategies.

Putting into context, Elliotrades likely uses these posts to establish authority in crypto trading, encouraging followers to trust their instincts based on market data rather than news. The retweet supports the idea that crypto success changes perspectives, aligning with their own narrative.
