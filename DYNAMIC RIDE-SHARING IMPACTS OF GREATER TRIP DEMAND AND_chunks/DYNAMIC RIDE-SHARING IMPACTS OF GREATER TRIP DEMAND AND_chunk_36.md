## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 36

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

As evident, AVO also remains higher than 1.40
throughout the day starting from AM peak highlighting best use of the SAV fleet at most hours
in the day. If this sharing peaks throughout the day, like in 25x (not shown), it may point towards
the requirement of a larger fleet to maintain low eVMT but at the cost of higher idling time (and
parking space use). It is also important to note that all AVO values mentioned here are for singleparty requests. VMT savings will remain more or less the same with multi-person parties who
may have shared the ride, but the reported AVO will be higher for such a service. 1x

5x

Figure 5 Impact of Stop Aggregation on Temporal Distribution of AVO for 1x and 5x Demand
Reductions in system and fleet VMT come at the cost of travelers incurring delays while sharing
rides. Figure 6 illustrates the total time spent walking to or from a stop, waiting for an SAV, and,
subsequently, time spent in an SAV.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is providing technical details on Average Vehicle Miles Traveled (AVMT) (1x and 5x demand). Here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details:**

* AVMT represents the total distance traveled by vehicles on a given day.
* The text mentions "system" and "fleet," which implies a larger system or network of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs).
* The use of "1x" and "5x" demand refers to a scenario with 1,000 single-party requests and 50,000 multi-person requests, respectively.

**Process:**

The section describes the impact of demand on AVMT using two figures:

* Figure 5 plots the temporal distribution of AVO for 1x and 5x demand reductions.
* Figure 6 illustrates the total time spent by travelers:
	+ Walking to or from a stop
	+ Waiting for an SAV
	+ Spending time in an SAV

**Connection to surrounding context:**

The current text chunk connects to the broader discussion on shared autonomous vehicles, including their performance and potential impacts. The references provided are relevant to understanding how AVO (Average Vehicle Miles Traveled) is affected by demand, which is a critical parameter in optimizing SAV fleet management.

**Requirements and conditions:**

* The timeframe of 2014 to 2020 indicates that the analysis is based on recent developments in the field.
* The authors mention "key authors," implying that they have chosen specific studies for reference.
