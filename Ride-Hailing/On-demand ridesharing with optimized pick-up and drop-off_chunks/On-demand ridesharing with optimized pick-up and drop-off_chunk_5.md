A. Fielbaum et al. Fig. 1. A vehicle from a ridesharing system that saves significant driving time by requiring the user to walk to/from the fast street in which the
vehicle is currently driving. In the top row, the service is door-to-door, i.e., the vehicle must visit the exact origin (O) and destination (D) of a
passenger, whereas in the bottom row, walking is admitted (dashed lines). points that can differ from their actual origins and destinations. As we detail in the forthcoming Section 1.1, asking some users to walk might generate relevant benefits to the system. The usual
door-to-door scheme often forces the vehicle to drive through very slow streets, or to deviate from the shortest and fastest paths,
situations that could be avoided if users are willing to take short walks.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining a key concept in ridesharing systems: **Meeting Points**.

**Technical Details/Parameters/P processes:**

* The concept of meeting points refers to locations where two or more vehicles meet to pick up passengers.
* Meeting points can be defined as specific locations, such as street corners, intersections, or designated areas, where vehicles typically converge.
* The purpose of meeting points is to optimize the pickup and delivery process, reducing travel time and increasing efficiency.

**Connection to surrounding context:**

The text builds upon the previous section on **Rebalancing Strategies**, which addresses various strategies for managing ridesharing systems. Meeting points are a critical aspect of rebalancing strategies, as they enable vehicles to converge at specific locations, facilitating efficient pickup and delivery processes.

**Specific requirements/conditions constraints:**

* The article assumes that meeting points can be defined and managed by the system administrators or ride-sharing platforms.
* The use of walking as a convenient alternative for users may require additional infrastructure, such as designated walking paths or pedestrian zones.
* Meeting points should be strategically located to reduce travel time and increase passenger satisfaction.

In summary, this text chunk explains the concept of meeting points in ridesharing systems, highlighting their importance for optimizing pickup and delivery processes. The connection to previous sections emphasizes the interplay between rebalancing strategies and meeting point management, while specific requirements and constraints underscore the need for careful design and implementation of meeting point infrastructure.
