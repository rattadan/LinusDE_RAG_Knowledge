## Chunk 23

**Original Text:**

The Web3 developer ecosystem can be
defined by the number of downloads for essential libraries for Web3 app development and smart contract
deployment. From 2021 to 2022, the number of weekly downloads for essential Web3 libraries like
Ethers.js and Web3.js increased by 178% to 1,536,548 downloads per week, and continues to grow in
spite of “crypto winter” conditions (Alchemy, 2022). Smart contract deployment as of Q4 2022 has been
up 293% to 17,736 new monthly verified smart contracts. These are all positive indicators that the Wed3
developer community is steadily growing. There are no well-defined sector stats for gig-economy
developers.
