## Chunk 15

**Original Text:**

As a result, the total cost of the agency and users can be minimized by choosing optimal values for the system capacity and the number of waiting requests. Meanwhile an appropriate demand management strategy that can make the demand uniform is required to keep the system optimized over time. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature in this discipline. The modeling tools that are adapted in this paper to approximate the costs for the agency and users of the DRT service are presented in Section 3. Then in Section 4, the system optimum problem is formulated to minimize the total cost of the agency and users in three possible scenarios: optimizing the operating capacity of the service, optimizing the number of waiting requests, and optimizing both together.

The paper explores minimizing the total cost of the Dynamic Residential Time-Travel (DRT) service by optimizing system capacity and waiting request numbers through appropriate demand management strategies. The goal is to keep the system optimized over time.

A review of existing literature in this discipline is presented in Section 2, covering key concepts, models, and tools used for cost analysis. This includes a discussion on modeling approaches to approximate agency and user costs, as well as relevant research findings.

In Section 3, the modeling tools are adapted to simulate different scenarios:

1. Optimizing operating capacity of the service: This involves adjusting parameters such as arrival rate, departure rate, and network utilization to minimize costs.
2. Optimizing waiting requests: The number of customers in each queue is increased or decreased to manage demand, with corresponding adjustments to system operations and resource allocation.
3. Combining optimization of both: The paper explores how the two approaches can be integrated to achieve optimal results.

Section 4 formally presents the problem-solving framework for minimizing total costs under three scenarios:

1. Optimize operating capacity: Formulate a mathematical model to minimize costs by adjusting key parameters, such as service rates and queue lengths.
2. Optimize waiting requests: Develop an optimization algorithm to find the optimal number of customers in each queue while considering factors like system performance, resource utilization, and user satisfaction.
3. Combine optimizations: Integrate insights from both scenarios to develop a comprehensive approach that balances competing objectives, including costs, wait times, and overall system efficiency.

These three scenarios provide a holistic framework for managing DRT services to minimize costs while ensuring efficient and responsive systems over time.
