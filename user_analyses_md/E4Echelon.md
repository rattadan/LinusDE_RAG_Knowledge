Looking at these tweets in context:
The author seems to be building a community identity around the "Gm Legends" brand, which appears to be centered on positive, motivational messaging. They're positioning themselves at the intersection of DeFi (particularly Sei Network) and iOS development communities. The repetitive "Gm Legends" posts serve to reinforce this brand identity, while the iOS developer question and DeFi retweets suggest they're either looking to build a project that combines both or to connect with different technical communities within the crypto space.
