## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 31

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

**Original Text:**

Similar to the finding in [see, e.g., 9], this highlights the
importance to combine ’pull’ measures (introducing DRT as a new mode of transportation) with ’push’ measures,
such as, implementing a road pricing scheme, increasing parking costs or banning private vehicles in certain areas. In
several simulation experiments, even for a city-wide DRT and a minimum fee, a significant share of DRT users come
from the PT mode. From the user perspective, this indicates a positive effect since users switching from PT to DRT
experience a reduced travel time and obtain a higher utility. Future studies will address service concepts which aim at a desired mode shift effect. The simulation setup will
also be extended to account for intermodal trips, in particular the combination of PT and DRT which is expected to
have a positive effect on the modal shift from car to PT and/or DRT.
