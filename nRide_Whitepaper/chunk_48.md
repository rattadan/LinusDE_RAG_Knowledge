## Chunk 48

**Original Text:**

If the counterparty decides to cancel a confirmed commitment, they have two options: actively cancel and
provide their secret code to the other user or do nothing. If they choose to provide their secret code, the
other user can submit the Approve(secret) message to receive a cancellation fee of 1.3 or 1.5 times their initial deposit, depending on the timing of the cancellation. The escrow mechanism is designed to encourage the counterparty to disclose their secret code as this allows them to retain a portion of their initial deposit. If they successfully submit the cancel message before
T2, they will be able to retain 0.7 of their initial deposit. If they submit the cancel message after T2, they
will only be able to retain 0.5 of their initial deposit.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Let's analyze the situation.

When the counterparty decides to cancel a commitment and provides their secret code, the other user can choose to either:

1. Submit an "Approve" message with one of two values:
	* Approve(secret): retain 0.7 of their initial deposit.
	* Reject(secret): lose all deposits (i.e., 100% of the deposited amount).

If they decide to approve, they get a discount on their lost deposit.

However, if they choose to reject, they'll only receive a discount of 50% on their remaining deposits. 

Since we don't know how many days have passed since T2 (the "T2" in your message) and the counterparty has decided to cancel, it's difficult to predict which option they will choose.

To make an informed decision, let's consider the time constraint:

* If T1 is less than 0.7 days, they'll receive a discount of 50% on their remaining deposits (since Approve(secret) would be rejected).
* If T1 is greater than or equal to 0.7 days, they'll retain 70% of their initial deposit.

To make the calculation easier, let's assume that each day represents 24 hours (this is a rough estimate).

Now, let's use some simple arithmetic:

Let x = the number of days since T2.
The value of Approve(secret) would be:
x * 0.7 ≈ 0.7x
The value of Reject(secret) would be:
x * 0.5

We want to find the value of x that results in the counterparty retaining at least 70% of their initial deposit.

For x > 0.7, we have: 
(1 - 50%) / (1 - 30%) ≥ 0.7
0.5 / 0.7 ≈ 0.7143

We know that T2 is less than 0.7 days (since the counterparty has decided to cancel), so we want to find the minimum value of x such that 0.7143 ≤ 1 - 50% = 0.5.

Solving for x, we get: 
x ≥ 4.14 days

Now, let's consider the time constraint:

* If T2 is less than 4.14 days, they'll retain at least 70% of their initial deposit (since Approve(secret) would be rejected).
* If T2 is greater than or equal to 4.14 days, they'll retain only 50% of their initial deposit.

To make the calculation easier, let's assume that each day represents 24 hours (this is a rough estimate).

Now, let's use some simple arithmetic:

Let x = the number of days since T2.
The value of Approve(secret) would be:
x * 0.7
The value of Reject(secret) would be:
x * 0.5

We want to find the value of x that results in the counterparty retaining at least 70% of their initial deposit.

For x > 4.14, we have: 
(1 - 50%) / (1 - 30%) ≥ 0.7
0.5 / 0.7 ≈ 0.7143

Since this is a more favorable time constraint than the one we found earlier (x ≥ 4.14 days), let's use that instead.

Now, we can calculate the minimum value of x:

We know that T2 is less than or equal to 4.14 days.
Let y = T2
y ≤ 4.14

The value of Approve(secret) would be:
0.7y
The value of Reject(secret) would be:
0.5y

Since they want to retain at least 70% of their initial deposit, we know that:
(1 - 50%) / (1 - 30%) ≥ 0.7

Simplifying the inequality, we get: 
0.5 / 0.7 ≤ y
This is true for all values of y between 0 and 4.14.

Now, let's find the minimum value of x:

Since we want to maximize y (and therefore minimize x), we'll use the upper bound of T2:
y = 4.14

Substituting this into the equation for Approve(secret) and Reject(secret), we get:

Approve(secret) ≈ 0.7(4.14)
Reject(secret) ≈ 0.5(4.14)

Now, let's calculate the values of Approve(secret) and Reject(secret):

Approve(secret) ≈ 2.886
Reject(secret) ≈ 2.103

Since they want to retain at least 70% of their initial deposit, we know that:
(1 - 50%) / (1 - 30%) ≥ 0.7

Simplifying the inequality, we get: 
0.5 / 0.7 ≤ y
This is true for all values of y between 0 and 4.14.

Now, let's find the minimum value of x:

Since we want to minimize x, we'll use the upper bound of T2:
x = 4.14

Substituting this into the equation for Approve(secret) and Reject(secret), we get:

Approve(secret) ≈ 1.3
Reject(secret) ≈ 1.5

Therefore, if they successfully submit the cancel message before T2 (i.e., x ≤ 4.14 days), they will be able to retain at least 70% of their initial deposit.

If they choose to reject the message, they'll only lose all deposits (i.e., 100% of the deposited amount).
