## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages.

First, I notice there are several bots posting updates. The osmosis_statbot mentions Epoch rewards distribution, explaining that liquidity mining and staking rewards are distributed daily at 17:15 UTC. Users should check their Portfolio tab after that time. Andre_Kalin is having an issue with staking rewards not coming through even though validators aren't jailed. That's a problem they need to address.

Then, the osmogovbot posts about two proposals. One is the Picasso Revenue Share Proposal, which talks about waiving bridging fees between Picasso and Osmosis in exchange for sharing taker fees from trading. The other is "Make Osmosis Great Again," which suggests strategies to attract new projects and improve the ecosystem. Both proposals are looking for community feedback.

There are some user comments. Svansy is concerned about Osmosis' current state, noting that many pools have lower liquidity, making trading difficult. Kzzyt agrees with a previous point and mentions Noble Chain if there's interest. Kychuli and Sta5iu discuss being online and Epoch staking rewards. Crytekllc is a new user asking for news and price analysis after buying OSMO. Formione announces a partnership with Injective for a meme coin platform, which seems exciting for new projects.

Other messages like #safetytips and memes are probably less critical. I need to filter out the noise and focus on the main proposals, technical issues, and community concerns. The key decisions here are the Picasso revenue sharing agreement and the proposal to revitalize Osmosis. Technical issues with staking rewards and liquidity pool concerns are important for operational aspects. The Injective partnership is a new development that could impact the ecosystem.

I should structure the summary around these elements: the two main proposals, the staking reward issue, liquidity pool concerns, and the new partnership. Also mention the new user's inquiry as it reflects community engagement. Keep it concise, bullet points might work best here. Avoid the less relevant messages like memes and casual comments unless they tie into a key point. Make sure to highlight the main actions or decisions needed from the proposals and the problems identified.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or topics.

Starting with the first few lines, there are messages from osmosis_statbot and osmogovbot. The statbot mentions visiting the official support site, so "official support site" is a topic. Then there's a proposal about Picasso Revenue Share, which includes details about Protocol Revenue sharing, waiving bridging fees, and sharing taker fees. So "Picasso Revenue Share Proposal" and "Protocol Revenue sharing agreement" would be relevant here. Also, terms like "bridging fees" and "taker fees" are part of that proposal.

Next, kzzyt's messages talk about presenting something better and Noble, so "presentation improvement" and "Noble" (maybe a project or chain?) could be topics. Then there's a mention of Epoch, which seems to be a daily event for reward distribution. The osmosis_statbot explains that during Epoch, Liquidity Mining Rewards and Staking Rewards are distributed. So "Epoch reward distribution", "Liquidity Mining Rewards", and "Staking Rewards" are important topics here. Also, the timing of Epoch at 17:15 UTC and the Portfolio tab are specific details, but maybe the main topics are the reward mechanisms.

Andre_Kalin's message brings up an issue with Osmo staking rewards not coming through even though validators aren't jailed. So "OSMO staking rewards delay" and "validator status" are topics. Svansy's comments mention liquidity pools decreasing and difficulty trading in smaller pools, so "liquidity pool depletion" and "trading in small pools" are topics. There's also a mention of "wen W" which might refer to a token or event, so "wen W" could be a topic.

Other messages include a user asking about the latest news and price analysis for OSMO, so "latest news on Osmosis" and "OSMO price analysis" would be topics. Formione's messages discuss launching meme coins on Injective, so "meme coin creation on Injective" and "Start.cooking app" are relevant. There's also a link to a Twitter post, which might be part of that announcement.

Additional topics include "Dojo_Swap liquidity pools", "bonding curve

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through each message carefully. 

First, there are several automated messages from osmosis_statbot and osmogovbot. These are just informational, providing links to support sites or announcing events like Epoch rewards. They don't have any emotional tone, so I'll mark those as neutral.

Then there's a message from kzzyt agreeing that something could be presented better. That sounds like a constructive criticism, so maybe slightly negative? But since it's about improving presentation, not the platform itself, perhaps neutral. Hmm, I'll think more on that.

Andre_Kalin is asking about staking rewards not coming through smoothly even though validators aren't jailed. This indicates a problem, so that's negative sentiment. 

Svansy's messages are more concerning. He says Osmosis isn't what it used to be, mentions pools having lower liquidity, making trading difficult. That's definitely negative. The "wen W pls" is a request for something (maybe more liquidity?), which shows impatience or frustration, so also negative.

Damian_S's post about making Osmosis great again suggests that the current state isn't great, which is negative. He's looking to improve things, so the sentiment here is critical of the present situation.

Crytekllc is new and bought OSMO, asking for news and price analysis. He seems positive about joining but the message is more neutral as he's seeking information. 

NotVitalik and Formione mention some positive stuff like "amazing stuff" and being thrilled about a new launch on Injective. Those are positive sentiments. 

Sta5iu's messages are about submitting a proposal and being nervous, which might be neutral or slightly positive if they're excited. The "im just wee bit scared" is a bit of anxiety but not necessarily negative towards the platform. 

Other messages from kychuli and ips14 are neutral or transactional. 

Putting it all together: the negative sentiments come from Andre_Kalin, Svansy, and Damian_S. The positive ones are from NotVitalik and Formione. The rest are neutral. 

The overall sentiment might lean negative because the critical messages are about the platform's current issues, which are more impactful than the positive ones. But I need to check if the positive messages are enough to balance it. However, since the negative comments

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a series of chat messages from different bots and users, and I need to go through each one to identify any specific tasks, decisions made, or upcoming steps mentioned.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot at 21:58:56. It says to visit the support site if help is needed. That's a suggestion but maybe not an action item unless someone needs to act on it. The same message is repeated again from 21:56:13, so maybe that's just a reminder but not an action item.

Next, osmogovbot at 20:00:51 mentions a proposal by @jde17 about Picasso Revenue Share. The proposal involves waiving bridging fees and sharing taker fees. The action here might be that the community needs to review or provide feedback on this proposal. Also, the link to the forum post is provided, so maybe the next step is to check that link.

Then there's a message from kzzyt at 19:07:26 saying they've seen the proposal and agree it could be presented better. That's feedback, but not an action item unless someone is supposed to act on that feedback. Maybe the proposer needs to revise the presentation, but it's not clear who is responsible.

Another kzzyt message at 19:06:30: "@Svansy sure we could do noble if there were interest." Noble might refer to a project or initiative. If there's interest, they might proceed. So this is a conditional next step‚Äîwaiting for interest to take action.

The osmosis_statbot at 18:27:20 explains the Epoch schedule and reward distributions. This is informational, but the action items here could be for users to claim their staking rewards by connecting to Keplr wallet. Also, mentioning checking the Portfolio tab after 17:15 UTC is a step users should take.

kychuli's message at the same time says distribution is once per day at #epoch. Again, informative but maybe reinforcing the need to check during Epoch.

Andre_Kalin at 18:26:38 is asking about Osmo staking rewards not coming through even though validators aren't jailed.
