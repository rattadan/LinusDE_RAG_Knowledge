**Original Text:**

Overall, this process helps to create a more transparent and reliable ride sharing experience for both passengers and drivers, by providing a mechanism for canceling ride requests and receiving refunds if necessary. The use of the secret phrase also helps to ensure that the refund process is secure and that only authorized
parties can redeem their deposit from the escrow account. -6-

3. Escrow
The escrow mechanism is a crucial component of the nRide protocol that ensures trust and security for both
riders and drivers. By locking funds in escrow until the pickup is completed, the mechanism mitigates the
risk of a late cancellation or no-show. This creates a level playing field for riders and drivers and incentivizes them to fulfill their respective obligations.
