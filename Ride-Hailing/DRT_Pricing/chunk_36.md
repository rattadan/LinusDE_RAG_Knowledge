## Chunk 36

**Original Text:**

The Berlin case study which is used in this study is publicly available on https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsimberlin (development branch 5.5.x, commit 7c5c791). Simulation setup. The DRT mode is added to the existing modes of transportation and may be used for trips starting
and ending within the service area. Agents are also allowed to walk a maximum distance of 2 km to get from outside
the service area to the DRT pick-up point, or the other way round, from the drop-off point inside the service area to
their trip destination outside the service area. A trip request starting and/or ending outside the range of 2 km walking
distance to or from the service area will not be served and the agent is forced to use the walk mode for the entire trip.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided information, here's a summary of the simulation setup:

**Transportation Modes:**

1. Existing modes of transportation (not specified)
2. DRT (Direct Regional Transit) mode
3. Additional modes of transportation (not specified)

**Restrictions:**

* Agents can walk up to 2 km from outside the service area to get to a DRT pick-up point, or back down from their trip destination to an outside stop.
* If a trip request is made outside this range, it will not be served and agents will be forced to use the walk mode for the entire trip.

**Key Features:**

* Trip requests starting and/or ending within the service area are allowed, allowing for seamless transitions between different transportation modes.
* Agents can also travel on DRT with an optional 2 km walking distance restriction from outside or inside the service area.
