I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

The unselected vehicles
are then available for the profit calculation in the next iteration. Once all vehicles are repositioned or there are no more profitable
repositioning orders possible, the process is stopped and the
solution is executed. ‚Ä¢ Fleet size, in relation to the service area
‚Ä¢ Demand-supply-ratio, as indication for over- and undersupply
‚Ä¢ Maximum allowed customer waiting time before pickup or rejection
‚Ä¢ Vehicle availability (all or only non-serving vehicles)
We consider three different fleet sizes, with ùëâ ‚àà {30, 100, 300}. The
number of requests depends on the fleet size. We define the demandsupply-ratio (ùê∑ùëÜùëÖ) as the number of requests per day per vehicle. We
use ùê∑ùëÜùëÖ ‚àà {40, 70, 100}, representing fleets with low utilization, high
utilization, and overloaded fleets. For the maximum waiting time ùëáùëä ,
we use three different settings: short waiting time, long waiting time,
and no waiting time.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters**

1. The text mentions a fleet size (V ‚àà {30, 100, 300}) and defines it as the number of vehicles.
2. Three specific fleet sizes are defined: V = 30, V = 100, and V = 300.
3. The demand-supply ratio (DSR) is defined as DSR ‚àà {40, 70, 100}, which represents different levels of fleet utilization.
4. The maximum allowed customer waiting time before pickup or rejection (TW) is defined, but its exact value is not provided.

**Connections to the Surrounding Context**

1. The text assumes a ride-hailing system where vehicles are assigned requests based on demand and supply ratios.
2. It discusses various metrics used to evaluate the performance of such systems, including fleet size, DSR, TW, and vehicle availability (non-serving vs. serving).
3. The context also mentions simulation platforms like DIMACS Center for Discrete Mathematics: Hailing Challenge [2], which suggests that this text is part of a broader research effort.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints**

1. The text requires the presence of specific metrics to evaluate fleet performance (V ‚àà {30, 100, 300}, DSR ‚àà {40, 70, 100}, TW).
2. The demand-supply ratio is an important factor in determining fleet efficiency and profitability.
3. The maximum allowed customer waiting time before pickup or rejection is a critical consideration for ensuring smooth operations.
4. The text implies that the system may need to handle varying levels of demand and supply ratios across different fleet sizes, indicating flexibility in its design.
