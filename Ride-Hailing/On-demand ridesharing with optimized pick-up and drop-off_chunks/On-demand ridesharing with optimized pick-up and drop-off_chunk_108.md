**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section explains the technical details of the ride-sharing system being described in this reference list.

The key technical parameters discussed are:

1. Model predictive control (MPC): A control approach that aims to optimize the operation of ride-sharing autonomous mobility on-demand systems.
2. Vehicle rebalancing: The process of adjusting the number of vehicles available for transport to match demand, with the goal of improving efficiency and reducing congestion.

The section also mentions specific heuristics used in this context, including:

1. Demand-anticipatory insertion (DAI) heuristics: A type of heuristic that anticipates future demand patterns to optimize the routing and scheduling of vehicles.
2. Mathematical modeling: The use of mathematical models to represent the dynamics of the ride-sharing system, such as MPC algorithms.

The section connects this technical information to the surrounding context by highlighting its relevance to ridesharing systems with meeting points. Specifically:

1. The need for efficient routing and scheduling in ridesharing systems
2. The importance of vehicle rebalancing to match demand
3. The use of advanced simulation techniques, such as MPC and mathematical modeling, to optimize ride-sharing operations.

The technical details described are also connected to the surrounding context through the discussion of:

1. Current research trends in ridesharing systems with meeting points
2. The benefits of using DAI heuristics in these systems
3. The growing sophistication of ride-sharing operations that require advanced simulation techniques.
