I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

To summarize, while the service rate can be slightly
increased by preferring shorter requests, considering the distances to
the pickup locations seems to be the most appropriate way to calculate
the costs. What is the influence of integrating the first-come-first-serve
method into the matching approach? If there are more open requests
than available vehicles in a matching epoch, preference can be given
to the requests waiting the longest. This ensures that no customer will
receive an answer before all the other customers that called earlier. Fig. 2 shows an example of the notification time of the customers in a
setting without a maximum waiting time, once without (left) and once
with (right) first-come-first-serve integration. The matching interval is
ùõøùëÄ = 60 s, and all requests can be matched within the first matching
epoch, except in the last third of the planning horizon. There, however,
the demand exceeds the supply and some requests have to be postponed
to subsequent matching epochs.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

* The text mentions a "matching approach" which appears to be a concept in computer science related to routing or scheduling, specifically in the context of ride-hailing systems.
* The "request", "pickup locations", and "notification time" seem to refer to specific data points within the system that are being analyzed or visualized.

**Context:**

The current text chunk is providing an overview of a concept called dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on the matching approach. The context appears to be discussing the limitations and challenges of managing ride-hailing services with limited vehicle capacity and increasing demand, particularly when there are more open requests than available vehicles.

The text mentions several key concepts and methodologies mentioned by others in the same field (e.g., simulation, deep learning approaches), but focuses primarily on dynamic dispatch and real-time management. The chunk seems to be providing a descriptive analysis of how these concepts can be applied to improve the matching approach in ride-hailing systems.

**Building upon the Surrounding Context:**

The current text chunk appears to be building upon earlier discussions about simulation, deep learning approaches, and other methodologies discussed by others in the same field. The text is likely connecting these ideas back to a real-world application or case study of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no explicit requirements or conditions mentioned in this chunk, but it appears that the analysis is focused on understanding how dynamic dispatch and real-time management can be applied to improve the matching approach in ride-hailing systems. The text mentions a specific planning horizon (60 seconds) and scenarios where the demand exceeds the supply, indicating that certain constraints are in place (e.g., limited vehicle capacity).
