## Chunk 12

**Original Text:**

Riders can broadcast a ride
request to drivers within their vicinity, and drivers can bid on the request by naming their price. This gives
riders the ability to choose a driver that best fulfills their needs, whether they are price-sensitive or quality
sensitive. Our escrow smart contract discourages users from behaving in a way that negatively affects
other users by ensuring that both riders and drivers fulfill their commitments by holding funds in escrow
until a pickup is completed or canceled. We monetize through the sale of $NRIDE tokens, which power components of the nRide protocol, and
application. Concretely, we provide open-source tools, which enable developers to integrate nRide into
their services, and $NRIDE tokens are necessary to use these tools.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're describing a ride-hailing or transportation platform that utilizes blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate the process of requesting rides and bid on drivers.

Here's a breakdown of what this system does:

1. **Ride requests**: Riders can make a request for a ride, specifying their pickup location and desired driver.
2. **Driver bidding**: Drivers can respond with their estimated price for the ride.
3. **Escrow system**: The platform holds funds in escrow until the rider confirms the pickup or cancels the request. This ensures that both parties fulfill their commitments.
4. **Token monetization**: The sale of $NRIDE tokens is used to power components of the nRide protocol and application, providing revenue for the platform.

The text also mentions open-source tools that allow developers to integrate the nRide protocol into their services, necessitating $NRIDE tokens for use.
