## Chunk 3

**Original Text:**

1. Introduction
Over the past decade, the ride-hailing industry has experienced significant growth, but it has also been
plagued by high fees, a lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns. Traditional ride-hailing applications operate in closed ecosystems, where their user bases are isolated from each other, leading to fragmented markets and limited opportunities for new entrants to compete with established players. To address these issues, nRide is developing a peer-to-peer ride-hailing protocol that connects riders and
drivers directly, eliminating intermediaries. By removing middlemen, nRide aims to reduce fees and increase transparency, while also creating a more equitable platform for drivers and riders.
