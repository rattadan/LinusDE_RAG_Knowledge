## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 106

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Because this has an angle of
45◦ to the coordinate axes (similarly to the square zones themselves),
we propose to rotate the coordinate system by 45◦ to simplify the
calculations. Fig. 9 shows the rotated version. The area of the rectangle
can be calculated using the following formula:
(√

𝐴rect =

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Text Chunk**

The provided text chunk is a mathematical formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle in a rotated coordinate system.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The formula calculates the area of a rectangle given its width (2x) and height (h), where x represents the distance from the origin to the left side of the rectangle, and y represents the distance to the top.
* The formula involves the square root function (√) and Pythagorean theorem (2√(x² + h²)).
* The dimensions of the rotated rectangle are defined by the original coordinates: (10, 15).
