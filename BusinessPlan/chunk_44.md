Hackathons
To aid in building a strong developer community and to drive the success of our protocol. We plan to host
a number of virtual hackathons focused on building with our protocol. Our hackathons will be designed to
attract Web3 developers, developers looking to build gig-economy applications, and to inspire developers
to pursue creative applications that incorporate our protocol. We will offer a variety of prizes to
incentivize participation, including small cash prizes and $NRIDE token allocations. In addition to the
hackathon event itself, we will provide ongoing support and resources to participating developers.
