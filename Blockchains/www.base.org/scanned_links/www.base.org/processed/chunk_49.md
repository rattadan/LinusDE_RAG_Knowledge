### Document Overview  
This content outlines rules and policies for registering and managing Basenames on the Base ecosystem, including discount eligibility, on-chain storage requirements, and integration guidelines.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Basenames**: Unique identifiers on the Base blockchain, usable across apps and services.  
- **On-chain Storage**: Data published and recorded on the blockchain, requiring transactions.  
- **Discounts**: Limited offers (e.g., free 4+ letter names) with rules (e.g., one per address, no multiple applies).  
- **Registration Fees**: Standard fees required to retain Basenames after discounts.  
- **BNS Name Owner Discount**: Free 4+ letter names for holders meeting specific criteria.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Discount Rules**:  
  - Discounts are applied once per address, with a 0.01 ETH cap per unique address.  
  - Highest-value discount applied automatically if multiple criteria are met.  
- **On-chain Integration**:  
  - Basenames are fully on-chain, requiring transactions for publication.  
  - Users must avoid publishing data not intended for on-chain storage.  
- **Registration Process**:  
  - Users can register Basenames via OnchainKit (tutorial provided).  
  - If a Basename is unavailable, it may be reserved.  
- **Form/Link**: A form is provided to register Basenames, with instructions sent upon submission.  

### Related Topics  
- **FAQ**: Links to FAQs for further details.

with the exception of the BNS name owner discount (valued at 0.01 ETH per unique address). You will need to pay the standard registration fees if you wish to keep your Basename after your initial discount has been fully applied.

Discounts are only applied once, and are limited to one per address. Even if you meet multiple criteria, you will only be eligible for a single discount on one Basename. If you satisfy multiple criteria, we will automatically apply the highest-value discount to your registration.

We are always looking to add more discounts. If you or your project have ideas for more discounts, please reach out to our team.

You can use your Basename across apps in the Base ecosystem, starting with base.org, Onchain Registry, and Onchain Summer Pass. You can also use it for sending and receiving on Base and other EVM chains.

Basenames are fully onchain, and therefore any information you publish is recorded onchain, requires a transaction, and will be broadly composable with the rest of the ecosystem. Please do not publish any information you do not wish to be onchain.

If you're a builder looking to integrate Basenames into your app,OnchainKitis the easiest way to get started (tutorial here). If you have ideas for new features or badges that you'd like to integrate with Basenames, we'd love to hear from you.

You can register a Basename for your app just like any other Basename. If a Basename for your app or project is not available, there is a good chance it was reserved.

Please reach out to our team or fill outthis formand we will reach out with instructions.
