**Original Text:**

The study of
Zwick, Kuehnel, and Hörl (2022) used a PUDO duration of 30 s when analyzing the operational aspects of ridepooling systems. They clarified that no additional time was added
for groups of passengers. Further simulative investigations concerning ridepooling (Zwick
et al. 2021; 2020; Zwick and Axhausen 2020a) also assumed a stop time of 30 s for each
PUDO event. Other ridepooling studies are expecting a significantly longer stop time. For
example, Stiglic et al. (2018) and Kagerbauer et al. (2021), both defined a time scale of two
minutes (120 s) for PUDO events, while Kagho et al. (2021) set the stop time parameter to
105 s in their simulation. However, in all these cases, the supposed duration for the PUDO

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk appears to be describing the operational aspects of ride-pooling systems, specifically the duration of a single passenger (PUDO) event in a simulation study.

Here's a focused analysis of what this chunk is explaining:

**Technical details:**

* The PUDO (Passenger Utilization Time) event represents a common term used in transportation studies to describe the time an individual spends in a vehicle, which can include periods during stops, pickups, and drop-offs.
* The duration of a single PUDO event is typically considered as a key performance indicator (KPI) for ride-pooling systems.

**Parameters or processes:**

* The text assumes that no additional time is added to the PUDO event for groups of passengers, which suggests that each passenger's individual travel time is being tracked.
* The study also defines specific stop times for different companies and services, such as Uber (30 seconds), Waymo (120 seconds), and Via Transportation (105 seconds).

**Connection to or building upon surrounding context:**

* This chunk connects to the broader discussion of ride-pooling studies in the reference list, which covers topics such as operational aspects, sustainability impacts, and simulation tools.
* The study's focus on PUDO events suggests that it is contributing to a larger body of research on shared mobility solutions.

**Specific requirements or conditions:**

* The text assumes a common understanding of transportation terms and concepts, such as passenger utilization time (PUDO) and simulation studies.
* It also assumes familiarity with the specific companies mentioned in the reference list, which are involved in ride-pooling services.
