## Chunk 19

**Original Text:**

In contrast, municipalities may need guidance on
how to regulate the existing DRT services in order to improve overall system welfare or follow a political agenda, e.g. a modal shift from private cars to environmental friendlier modes. This study investigates how the design of the DRT
service area and pricing scheme may affect transport usersâ€™ travel behavior. 2. Methodology

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're starting to describe a research study on the Design of Public Transport (DRT) services, specifically focusing on the impact of the service area design and pricing schemes on user travel behavior. Here's a possible continuation:

2.1. Research Question
This study aims to investigate how the design of the DRT service area (e.g., spatial structure, density, connectivity) and pricing scheme (e.g., fare rates, payment options) affect transport users' travel behavior in an urban context.

In this case, your research question might be:

"How does the spatial design of a DRT service area influence the choice of transportation mode, travel speed, and journey duration among commuters in a given city?"

This question suggests that you'll explore various factors that may impact how individuals choose to use public transport services, such as the physical layout of the route network, accessibility features, and incentives provided by pricing schemes.
