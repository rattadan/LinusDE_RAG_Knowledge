**Original Text:**

When they are
well-designed, they do not only minimize costs and emissions but
can increase the willingness to relinquish the use of private vehicles
due to improved service quality. In the extreme case, it could even
be possible to replace all personal vehicles in big cities by fleets of
autonomous—optimally electric—vehicles (Bischoff and Maciejewski,
2016). By that, resources would be used more efficiently due to higher
vehicle utilization, inner-city parking areas could be utilized by other
means, and individual mobility costs would decrease. In this paper, we are concerned with the ride-hailing problem,
where a fleet of vehicles is centrally controlled by a fleet operator to
pick up customers as quickly as possible and drop them off at their
target destination.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

The current text chunk describes dynamic dispatching in the context of ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on how well-designed strategies can lead to increased customer willingness to relinquish private vehicle use due to improved service quality.

The technical parameters mentioned are:

* Vehicle utilization: The proportion of vehicles that can be utilized efficiently.
* Electric usage: The use of electric vehicles (EVs) in the fleet.

**Contextual Connection and Requirements:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by highlighting the potential benefits of dynamic dispatching in ride-hailing systems, particularly when optimized for improved service quality. This requires:

* A central control system that can effectively manage vehicle deployment.
* Efficient use of resources (e.g., inner-city parking areas) to reduce costs and emissions.

The requirements mentioned are:

* Improved customer satisfaction through better service quality
* Increased willingness to relinquish private vehicle use due to the benefits offered by efficient resource usage.

**Specific Requirements or Constraints:**

To implement dynamic dispatching that maximizes these benefits, certain constraints must be considered, such as:

* The need for a central control system with efficient communication protocols.
* The requirement for optimized resource utilization (e.g., minimizing inner-city parking areas).
* The need to balance service quality with cost and emissions.

These requirements are likely met by using advanced algorithms, data analytics, and real-time optimization techniques to manage the ride-hailing fleet effectively.
