## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. 

First, I need to go through each of the tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first tweet says they're stopping news posts to participate in Gravity DEX. That's a decision to halt updates temporarily, so that's important.

Next, there's a tweet about existing $SENT ERC-20 holders having an extra four weeks to swap for $DVPN with a bonus. The extension and the bonus are key points here. 

Then, a couple of tweets mention Cosmonaut Radio Classics and the Gravity DEX countdown, indicating excitement and readiness. BitSong joining Gravity DEX is another key decision. 

The weekly stats and daily outpost are routine updates, but maybe not critical unless the user wants all mentions. The last tweet before the unknown messages is about voting for Proposal #4 in Starname with 10 hours left. Time-sensitive decision.

The unknown messages include a bot start and an update about Fetch.ai's $FET added to SputnikPriceBot, linking to their Telegram. Since the user mentioned focusing on key points and decisions, the main ones are the halt in news, the token swap extension with bonus, BitSong joining Gravity DEX, the Gravity DEX countdown, and the proposal voting deadline. Also, the Fetch.ai update might be relevant if it's part of the ecosystem. 

I should structure the summary to list each key point clearly, noting the decisions made and the important dates or actions. Omit less critical info like the radio mention and stats unless necessary. Check for conciseness and ensure all major decisions are covered. Make sure to mention the 4-week extension, the bonus eligibility, the Gravity DEX participation, BitSong's involvement, and the voting deadline. Also include the Fetch.ai token addition as part of ecosystem updates. Avoid the timestamps and permalinks since they're not key points. Use bullet points or a brief paragraph. Since the user wants it concise, maybe bullet points separated by key topics. Alright, that should cover it.

2. **Token

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to read through all the tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem to identify recurring or significant themes.

Looking at the first tweet, it mentions participating in Gravity DEX and stopping news posts. Gravity DEX seems important here. The next tweet talks about swapping $SENT for $DVPN with a bonus, so token swaps and specific tokens like SENT and DVPN are topics. Another tweet refers to Cosmonaut Radio Classics #10, which might be a series or event they have. Then there's a mention of BitSong joining Gravity DEX, so that's another participant. Weekly Cosmos Stats and Daily Cosmos Outpost indicate regular updates or reports. The countdowns like "Less than 1 hour to go!" and "It will be from minute to minute!" suggest an imminent event, maybe the launch of Gravity DEX. Also, the proposal voting for Proposal #4 in Starname is a governance topic. Lastly, the SputnikPriceBot update involving $FET and multiple tokens points to a new feature or integration related to price data in the Cosmos Ecosystem.

I should make sure to list each distinct topic without repetition. Let me check again: Gravity DEX is mentioned multiple times, so that's a key topic. Token swap (SENT to DVPN), Cosmonaut Radio Classics, BitSong's participation, Weekly and Daily Cosmos updates, countdown to Gravity DEX launch, governance voting (Proposal #4), and SputnikPriceBot's new features with $FET and token prices. Maybe combine the countdown mentions into one topic since they're related. Also, ensure that each topic is concise and captures the essence. Avoid including the permalinks or other metadata. The final list should be comma-separated and cover all the main points without missing anything important.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of the provided text. Let me start by reading through each of the tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem.

The first tweet says they're stopping to post news because they want to participate in Gravity DEX, with a "See you soon" message. That sounds positive, like they're excited about joining in. 

Next, there's a tweet about existing $SENT token holders having more time to swap for $DVPN and still being eligible for a bonus. Extending a deadline and offering a bonus usually indicates positive news for the holders, so that's probably positive sentiment.

Then there's a mention of Cosmonaut Radio Classics #10. This seems neutral because it's just an announcement without clear positive or negative words. 

Another tweet states "It will be from minute to minute! Get ready for the Gravity DEX!" The exclamation marks and "Get ready" suggest excitement and anticipation, so positive again.

BitSong participating in Gravity DEX is another tweet. Announcing a new participant is typically positive as it shows growth or collaboration.

"Weekly Cosmos Stats" is a regular update, so that's neutral. 

"Less than 1 hour to go!" uses exclamation and conveys urgency and excitement, likely positive. 

"Daily Cosmos Outpost" is another routine update, so neutral. 

The last tweet mentions having 10 hours left to vote for a proposal. It's informative, not clearly positive or negative, but maybe slightly positive because encouraging participation can be seen as positive. 

The unknown user's message about Sputnik Navigation System update and implementing $FET also sounds positive, highlighting new features and benefits. 

Putting it all together, most of the tweets are announcements about participation, updates, and upcoming events, which are generally positive. The neutral ones are the regular stats and radio posts. There's no negative language here. So overall sentiment is positive.
</think>

The sentiment of the provided text is **positive**.  

### Key Observations:  
1. **Excitement and Anticipation**: Multiple tweets express enthusiasm about upcoming events like "Gravity DEX" (e.g., "Get ready for the Gravity DEX!" and "Less than 1 hour to go!"), indicating optimism and eagerness.  
2. **Favorable Updates**: Announcements such as extending swap deadlines for tokens ($SENT to $DVPN) with added bonuses and new integrations (e.g

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The most recent one says they're stopping to post news because they want to participate in Gravity DEX. That sounds like a decision to pause updates for the event. Then another tweet mentions extending the swap period for SENT to DVPN with a bonus. The extension is a next step for token holders. 

Another tweet talks about Cosmonaut Radio Classics #10, which might be informational but not an action item. The "It will be from minute to minute!" tweet is probably building hype for Gravity DEX, so maybe not an action item. BitSong participating in Gravity DEX is another decision related to the event. 

The Weekly Cosmos Stats and Daily Cosmos Outpost are likely informational posts. The "Less than 1 hour to go!" and the vote reminder for Proposal #4 in Starname are time-sensitive actions. The user has until May 3 to vote, so that's a next step. 

The last two messages from unknown users are about starting a bot and an update on FET token prices. The Sputnik update might be an action item for the community to check the bot for FET prices.

I need to make sure I don't miss any deadlines or specific actions. The key points are the swap extension with a deadline, the voting deadline, and participation in Gravity DEX. Also, the FET implementation in the bot. I should present these clearly, noting the deadlines and what actions are required.

Here are the extracted action items, decisions, and next steps from the text:
