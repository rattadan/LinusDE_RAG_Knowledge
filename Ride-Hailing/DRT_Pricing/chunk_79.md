**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're referencing a study or research paper related to transportation planning and modeling, likely published as part of the book "Transportation Modeling" edited by John M. Reilly and Martin B. Orendorff.

The DOI (Digital Object Identifier) you provided is: doi:10.1016/j.tranpol.2017.09.005

However, I couldn't find any direct information about a study titled "[4] Fourie, P., 2016. Multi-modeling in matsim" or "[5]" being a part of this specific paper.

But based on the context and the book title "Transportation Modeling", I can make an educated guess that you might be referring to another paper or chapter within the same book.
