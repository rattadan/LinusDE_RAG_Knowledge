## Chunk 89

**Original Text:**

The risk is of selecting
an initial testing group that doesn't interact with each other
and doesn't actually use the application for everyday
journeys. The testing group is carefully chosen, with people who live or
work in a common location and who are regular taxi
users/drivers. For example, 10 taxis and 30 riders in a specific
borough of London would be a good testing ground. Effectiveness of escrow system:The escrow system is an
important part of the nRide protocol that effectively replaces
the cancellation fees on centralised platforms. These enable
users to be compensated when the other party cancels or
doesnâ€™t show up.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The risk in this scenario is that the testing group selected for the escrow system may not actually use the application for everyday journeys, which could lead to:

* Low usage rates, reducing the effectiveness of the escrow system.
* Fewer users to test the system with, which can impact its overall success.

By carefully choosing a testing group that represents real-life scenarios, such as regular taxi users and riders in London, the developers can ensure that the escrow system is effective at compensating users when it's most needed.
