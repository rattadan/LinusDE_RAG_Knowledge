Wait, I should double check whether "gm" is actually from the Safe account or if that's the user's content. Looking at the content structure, I see that the user provided a tweet with "gm" as the first line, but this appears to be part of the tweet content, not the username. Let me revise my analysis:

The tweet is from @safe (the official Safe account) and says:
"gm.
Great day to self custody, tbh."

Revised analysis:
This tweet is indeed from the official Safe account, which makes the promotion of self-custody particularly relevant since that's what their wallet service enables. The "gm" appears to be a friendly greeting to their followers, followed by a promotion of self-custody. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) adds a casual, conversational tone to the message.

The tweet appears to be part of a pattern where Safe uses casual, community-centric language to engage with their audience while promoting the core benefits of their product - secure self-custody of digital assets. This tweet represents a common marketing approach in crypto communities where participants greet each other with "gm" and use casual slang to build rapport.
