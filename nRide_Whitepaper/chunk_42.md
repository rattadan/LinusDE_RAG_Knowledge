**Original Text:**

•

Cancel(A) AND T1(B)
Party B never funded their account. After T1, Party A can withdraw their full deposit. •

Cancel(A) AND T2(B)
Party A actively cancels, they never received Party B’s secret code, and Party B timed
out. This happens when one party is a no-show, and they get penalized completely. •

T1(A) AND Approve(B, secret_a)
Not possible.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing a scenario involving banking or financial transactions between parties A and B. To provide more insight into the specific conditions mentioned:

- **Cancel(A)**: This action is not directly related to any of the given conditions but seems to imply a withdrawal from an account.
  
- **T1(B)**: Party B never funded their account, which might be a condition for withdrawing funds if A needs to access those funds.

- **Party A can withdraw their full deposit** after T1(B) because it's implied that A has a valid reason (T1(B)) to have the ability to access the funds, even though they cannot get B's secret code or are penalized due to being no-shows.

- **Cancel(A)** AND T2(B): Party A actively cancels and never received Party B’s secret code. However, this condition is more closely related to the fact that A has no way of accessing the funds until T1(B) is resolved because they cannot get the secret code from B.

However, if we're looking at a scenario where Party A can withdraw their full deposit after T1(A) AND Approve(B, secret_a), it suggests a situation where:

- **T1(A)** allows Party A to access the funds. This could be related to an initial withdrawal or another condition that implies Party A has a valid reason to access the funds.

- **Approve(B, secret_a)**: For Party B's secret code (secret_a) to work, they must approve it for Party A to have access to the funds. If this approval is not given (T2(A)), then Party A cannot withdraw their full deposit because the secret code cannot be used for withdrawal.

Given these conditions:

- **Not possible** implies that T1(A) AND Approve(B, secret_a) does not hold, as it contradicts the requirement for B's secret code to be approved.
