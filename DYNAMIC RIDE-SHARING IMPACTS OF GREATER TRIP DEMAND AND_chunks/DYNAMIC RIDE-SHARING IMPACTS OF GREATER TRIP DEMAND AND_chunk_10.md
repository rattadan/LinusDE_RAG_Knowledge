## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 10

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Curbside congestion may be alleviated
by dedicating specific streets or areas as pickup-and-drop-off (PUDO) zones. Washington, DC
piloted the implementation of PUDO zones for TNCs as a curbside congestion alleviation
measure as early as 2017 and has since expanded its pilot program (District Department of
Transportation, 2018). Houston and Boston followed suit in 2019 and 2020, respectively (City of
Houston, 2019; City of Boston, 2019). Although these programs have been implemented, the
system-wide benefits of aggregating trips at specific locations have not yet been quantified and
there is little information on how they have affected TNC operations and user walk and wait
times. The International Transport Forum (2018) conducted several microsimulations on the
interaction of curb space and curb use with PTVâ€™s VISSIM, revealing insights into how cities
can better manage curb space, to make streets safer and curbs more useful.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes:**

The current text chunk discusses a specific transportation strategy called "PUDO zones" (Pickup-and-Drop-off Zones), which aims to alleviate congestion by dedicating certain areas for pickups and drop-offs. The parameters mentioned are:

* A curb-space area or zone that is dedicated for PUDO
* The location of the PUDO zone (e.g., Washington, DC, Houston, Boston)
* Expansion plans for the pilot program in 2019 and 2020

**Connection to Surrounding Context:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

* Introducing a new transportation concept (PUDO zones) as a potential solution to alleviate congestion
* Providing background information on the International Transport Forum's microsimulations of curb space interaction with public transport vehicle (PTV) systems, which is relevant to the overall discussion of shared autonomous vehicles and urban transportation systems.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The chunk does not explicitly state specific requirements, conditions, or constraints related to implementing PUDO zones. However:

* The text mentions that there is little information available on how these programs have affected TNC operations and user walk-and-wait times
* It suggests that the International Transport Forum's microsimulations may provide insights into the interaction of curb space and curb use with PTVs, but this information is not yet quantified.

Overall, the chunk provides technical details about a specific transportation concept (PUDO zones) and its connection to the broader context of urban transportation systems. It also highlights potential requirements or conditions for implementing such programs.
