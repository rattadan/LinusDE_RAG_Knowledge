However, there are some key limitations to consider:

* The data only accounts for ride-hailing applications in the UK, and does not provide a comprehensive view of the global market.
* The serviceable market size is based on revenue generated by ride-hailing services, which may not be representative of the entire value chain (e.g., taxi fares, tolls).
* The drivers' demographics and mobility patterns are not explicitly defined in the data, making it challenging to estimate their contribution to the overall market.
