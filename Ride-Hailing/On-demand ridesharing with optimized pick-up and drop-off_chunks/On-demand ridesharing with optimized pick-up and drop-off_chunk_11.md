**Original Text:**

Large avenues are not only
faster than the rest, but they are also the ones with more intersections (Fielbaum et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2008; Figueiredo and
Amorim, 2007), meaning that using them requires fewer turns (which usually decreases speed). Therefore, transit lines are typiÂ­
cally designed to avoid small streets. A flexible ridesharing system, in which lines are not fixed, might also avoid these slow streets
to be more efficient. 3. Even if all streets were homogeneous, visiting the exact origins and destinations might impose significant extra detours to the route
of a transit vehicle (Li et al., 2015). By gathering users together, the system ensures that short routes can be followed. As we discuss
below, this is a central challenge for ridesharing systems that allow for walks. Traditional taxi services also require users to walk, but only to the pick-up point.
