## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on the key points and decisions. Let me start by reading through all the messages to understand the context.

First, there's a mention of "Price Is at big support" and "Big osmo pump incoming." That seems like someone is talking about the price of OSMO being at a support level and expecting a pump. Then, there's a discussion about a governance proposal from Terra Classic (LUNC and USTC) where they passed proposal #12181 to update website links on third-party platforms to terra-classic.money. They mention that Terraform Labs is winding down, so the community now governs Terra Classic. The new site is community-maintained. 

Several messages are about updating the website URLs on Osmosis, with references to GitHub asset lists and needing to change two links. There's a request to discuss with a valid person, probably someone authorized. Then, some users are talking about their purchase prices and the current price drop, expressing disappointment and asking about future enthusiasm and innovations. 

Another part mentions a livestream chat with Elys Network and that Coingecko and CMC are reviewing changes. There's a note about Osmosis development upkeep while waiting for Polaris, and concerns that Osmosis is being ignored in favor of Polaris, which might have its own token. Also, there's a mention of a monthly token burn proposal coming up after month-end.

So key points are:
1. Terra Classic governance proposal to update website links to terra-classic.money.
2. Osmosis-related discussions: price support, potential pump, link updates on platforms.
3. Community concerns about Osmosis token neglect and marketing focus on Polaris.
4. Upcoming monthly token burn proposal.
5. Livestream event with Elys Network.

I need to structure this clearly, highlighting decisions and main topics without getting bogged down in individual messages. Make sure to mention the proposal, the URL change, the price discussions, the token burn, the livestream, and the community's concerns about Osmosis's direction.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by reading through the entire text to understand what's going on.

First, there are several messages about price support and dependency on BTC. The user mentions "Price Is at big support, of course It depends on btc too" and "Big osmo pump incoming". So topics here might be price support, BTC dependency, and OSMO pump.

Then there's a part about updating website links for Terra Classic on third-party platforms. The user feelandbringrelief is discussing a governance proposal to change URLs from terra.money to terra-classic.money. This relates to Terra Classic, governance proposal, and website updates.

Another section involves Osmosis and its token. Users are asking about developments on Osmosis, concerns about the token being ignored, and the future of Polaris. For example, "Any development on osmosis alone?" and "Will polaris have its own token in future?" So topics here could be Osmosis token, Polaris, token burn proposals, and marketing shift.

There's also a livestream chat mentioned with Elys Network, so that's another topic. Additionally, some users talk about buying at certain prices and price drops, like "I bought at 9$ ü´°ü§ù" and "The price has dropped too much...", which relates to investment discussions and price analysis.

I should also note the references to Coingecko and CMC reviewing changes, which ties into third-party platforms. The GitHub link provided is about asset lists, so maybe asset list updates. The mention of a monthly token burn proposal would be token burn.

Putting this all together, the main topics are:
- Price support and BTC dependency
- OSMO pump speculation
- Terra Classic governance proposal (URL change)
- Osmosis token concerns and marketing shift to Polaris
- Polaris token future
- Token burn proposals
- Livestream chat with Elys Network
- Coingecko and CMC updates
- Asset list changes on GitHub
- Investment discussions and price analysis

I need to make sure these are concise and cover all the key points without overlapping. Let me check again. The Terra Classic part is about updating URLs, so maybe "Terra Classic URL update proposal". Osmosis token being ignored and marketing to Polaris could be "Osmosis token neglect concerns" and "Marketing shift

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this chat text. Let me start by reading through each message to understand the context and the emotions expressed.

First, the user Me372848... mentions that the price is at big support but depends on BTC. The term "big support" might indicate a positive outlook, but since it's conditional on BTC, maybe neutral? Not sure yet.

Then another message from the same user says "I think soon." That's pretty vague. Could be positive anticipation, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe neutral.

Next, they say "Big osmo pump incoming." "Pump" usually refers to a price increase, which is positive. So that's a positive message.

mikebarb says "Should be all set now." Neutral statement, just confirming something is done.

Osmosis_news shares a livestream link. That's informational, so neutral.

jeremyparish explains that data pulls from Cosmos Chain Registry. Neutral, informative.

feelandbringrelief mentions Coingecko and CMC are reviewing changes. Neutral, just stating a process.

jasbanza asks about asset URLs, maybe checking accuracy. Neutral.

Another jasbanza message points to a GitHub link. Neutral again.

Then feelandbringrelief provides detailed information about a governance proposal for Terra Classic. This seems positive as they're advocating for updates, but the content is factual and formal, so maybe neutral.

"Two links to change" from feelandbringrelief ‚Äì neutral.

"Can I discuss with valid person" ‚Äì maybe slightly positive if they're seeking to resolve something, but it's a request, so neutral.

EmpowerWill says "I bought at 9$ ü´°ü§ù" ‚Äì the emojis show camaraderie, but the price drop might be negative. However, buying could indicate optimism. Wait, the user's message is positive because they're sharing a purchase, even if the price is lower now. Maybe positive?

feelandbringrelief's message about contacting the Osmosis team is formal, so neutral.

vincentguan1 mentions buying OSMO at $1.2 and current price is $0.23. That's a significant drop. He says "price has dropped too much" and asks about advantages. Negative sentiment here.

EmpowerWill responds with "400% return gettin there!" which is positive, encouraging.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a series of chat messages, and I need to go through each one to identify any tasks, decisions made, or upcoming steps mentioned.

Starting from the bottom, the last message is from user_2138087871 asking "When is the next token burn". Then mikebarb says, "The next proposal for monthly burn should be up shortly after month end." So that's a next step: the monthly burn proposal will be posted after month end. I should note that as a next step.

Moving up, Amareswar8 has several messages. They mention feeling like Osmosis is being ignored, ask about Polaris having its own token, and question if there's any development on Osmosis alone. Then kychuli responds that it's mostly upkeep while Polaris is being released. So maybe the team is focusing on Polaris, but there's a concern about Osmosis development. However, the response from kychuli isn't an action item but more of a status update. The user's questions might indicate a need for communication or reassurance, but unless there's a specific action mentioned, maybe not an action item here. The next message from feelandbringrelief says Coingecko and CMC are reviewing changes. So that's an ongoing process, which could be an action item: Coingecko and CMC are in the process of updating links.

Looking at the messages from jasbanza and jeremyparish. jasbanza asks if the asset Twitter and website URLs are correct or if they pull from CoinGecko. jeremyparish says it pulls from the Cosmos Chain Registry, so once updated there, it will reflect on Osmosis. So the action item here is that updating the Cosmos Chain Registry will propagate changes to Osmosis and other apps. That might be a decision or a next step for the team.

Then feelandbringrelief sends a detailed message about changing the Terra Classic website links on third-party platforms due to governance proposal #12181. They mention that the new URL is terra-classic.money and that they need to update the links on Osmosis. So the action items here are to update the Website/Homepage links for LUNC and USTC on Osmosis and other platforms.
