## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 21

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

Base case

slightly higher than what could be assumed for Germany, they take into account the operational and capital cost of
SAVs in the most comprehensive way. Estimating the cost of current public transport operations is somewhat more
difficult for the city of Cottbus, due to their mixed operations that both include urban and regional bus lines as well as
tram lines.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section provides detailed technical parameters related to a simulation approach used in the paper.

**Technical Details:**

* The simulation models evaluate the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization for two types of demand responsive transport (DRT) systems: stop-based and door-to-door.
* It uses numerical methods to estimate the mean walk time, wait time, IVTT (in-time vehicles to target), and trip time under different fleet sizes and modes.

**Connection to Surrounding Context:**

This section builds upon the context by:

* Providing a detailed look at the operational costs of DRT systems in comparison to traditional public transport.
* Examining how these costs can be influenced by factors such as fleet size, mode of transportation, and traffic conditions.
* Highlighting the potential benefits of fully automated DRT systems in reducing travel times and operating costs.

**Specific Requirements or Conditions:**

This section does not explicitly mention any specific requirements or conditions, but it assumes:

* The simulation model is based on a comprehensive analysis that takes into account various factors such as operational and capital costs.
* The study aims to provide a realistic estimate of the operational costs associated with DRT systems in Cottbus.

Overall, this section is essential for understanding the technical aspects of demand responsive transport systems and their potential impact on urban transportation landscapes.
