Considering a linear model for the stop time, they assumed a boarding and alighting time of 10 s
for each student. However, they also mentioned that the stop time can vary in reality, as
the boarding of multiple people is expected to lead to less dwell time per person. A similar
procedure was conducted by Namdarpour et al. (2024). They assumed a base time of 50 s
per stop, added by 10 s for each passenger. Despite the evident impact of slight differences in stop times on overall service efficiency,
the related literature on DRT reveals high heterogeneity and dispersion in the estimated
