et al. 2023; Schlüter et al. 2021; Sörensen et al. 2021) or user characteristics (Gödde et al. 2023; Kostorz, Fraedrich, and Kagerbauer 2021; Lazarus et al. 2021). Compared to traditional PT, there is a considerable lack of empirical-based knowledge regarding PUDO activities in ridepooling systems. This deficiency was also noted by
Stueger, Fehn, and Bogenberger (2022, 4): ‘Literature on PUDO duration is scarce.’ Consequently, in the absence of solid data, assumptions about stop times are an inevitable
part of ridepooling simulation studies. This approach is increasingly challenged by recent
research (Lotze et al. 2023a; Zwick and Axhausen 2020b), highlighting the significant impact
of stop times on the efficiency of ridepooling services. Their findings underscore the need
for reliable data to ensure more accurate and effective simulations.
