Putting some tweets in bigger context of intentions:
The tweet about Ethereum's stablecoin market share (60.75%) appears to be part of a broader intention to demonstrate Ethereum's continued dominance and relevance in the crypto space, especially as other chains like Solana and Tron are gaining attention. By highlighting this data point, the author aims to reinforce confidence in Ethereum despite criticisms about its scalability or competition from other blockchains.

The tweet comparing Bitcoin's price movement to Ethereum's utility suggests the author wants to shift the narrative from simple price speculation to real-world usage and adoption of blockchain platforms.

The tweet about history repeating itself with Bitcoin and Ethereum seems to suggest that despite constant negative predictions ("Bitcoin died so many times"), Ethereum is going through similar challenges but will ultimately continue to grow and succeed.

The tweet about Coinbase being a "good thing" for Ethereum appears to be poking fun at critics who might view Coinbase's influence as negative, while suggesting that Ethereum's flexibility and openness is a strength.
