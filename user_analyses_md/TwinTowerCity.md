Putting these tweets in bigger context of intentions:
The account appears to be focused on promoting cryptocurrency and web3 awareness, positioning these technologies as the future of business and media. They're curating content from various crypto influencers and sharing narratives that suggest traditional media is losing relevance while decentralized platforms like X (Twitter) are gaining prominence.
