## Source Context
*From: https://solana.com/*

### Document Overview  
This content explains Solana's consensus mechanism, focusing on confirmation levels, voting processes, and RPC methods related to block data comparison.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Optimistic Confirmation**: A guarantee in release 1.3+ that blocks are confirmed without requiring full validation.  
- **Gossip and Replay Voting**: Mechanisms for nodes to incorporate votes from gossip (network-wide) and replay (reprocessing historical data).  
- **Block Votes**: Direct votes on a block, excluding descendants, to ensure correctness.  
- **RPC Methods**:  
  - `memcmp`: Compares bytes of a program account with a provided dataset, requiring Solana Core v1.14.0 or newer.  
  - `context`: Tracks the slot and operation evaluation in RPC responses.  
  - `dataSize`: Compares the length of program account data with a provided size.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Confirmation Levels**:  
  - Level 1: Direct votes on the block, no descendant votes.  
  - Level 2: Votes from gossip and replay.  
  - Level 3: Optimistic confirmation guarantees (release 1.3+).  
- **Vote Mechanics**:  
  - Votes are aggregated from gossip (network-wide) and replay (reprocessing).  
  - Descendants of a block are excluded from vote counting.  
- **RPC Features**:  
  - `memcmp` requires `encoding` (base58 or base64) and `bytesdata` (128 bytes max).  
  - `dataSize` compares program account data length to provided size.  
  - `context` includes `slot` and `operation` details in RPC responses.  

### Related Topics  
- **Solana RPC Methods**: The document references `memcmp`, `context`, and `dataSize` as part of Solana's RPC framework.  
- **Consensus Parameters**: The content ties to Solana's consensus logic, including how blocks are validated and confirmed.  
- **JSON Data Structures**: The `RpcResponseContext` and `Memcmp` example align with Solana's JSON-based RPC design.

- processed- the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block
may still be skipped by the cluster.
- context: An RpcResponseContext JSON structure including aslotfield at
which the operation was evaluated.
- value: The value returned by the operation itself.
- memcmp: object- compares a provided series of bytes with program account
data at a particular offset. Fields:offset: usize- offset into program account data to start comparisonbytes: string- data to match, as encoded stringencoding: string- encoding for filterbytesdata, either "base58" or
"base64". Data is limited in size to 128 or fewer decoded bytes.NEW: This field, and base64 support generally, is only available in
solana-core v1.14.0 or newer. Please omit when querying nodes on earlier
versions
