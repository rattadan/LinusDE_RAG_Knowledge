Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, Offchain Labs agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Offchain Labs written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).

You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service, and Offchain Labs will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Offchain Labs reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.

These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Offchain Labs governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Offchain Labs with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Offchain Labs submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York, New York. The failure of Offchain Labs to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
