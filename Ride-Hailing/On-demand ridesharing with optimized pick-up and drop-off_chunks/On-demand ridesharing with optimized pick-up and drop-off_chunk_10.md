**Original Text:**

A vehicle from a ridesharing system that avoids a long detour by requiring the users to walk to/from the fast street in which the vehicle is
currently driving. In the top row, the vehicle must visit the exact origins (O1, O2) and destinations (D1, D2) of two passengers, whereas in the
bottom row walking is admitted (dashed lines). Nelson, 2011; Hensher and Golob, 2008; Levinson et al., 2003). Allocated lanes on the streets, in which private vehicles cannot
enter, have also proved quite efficient (Basso and Silva, 2014; Basso et al., 2019). Ridesharing systems, if integrated into the general
urban mobility system, might also take advantage of this last type of infrastructure. 2. Even without specialized infrastructure, cities naturally evolve with streets of different hierarchies.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the concept of "meeting points" in ridesharing systems and their impact on efficiency, user satisfaction, and overall system performance.

The exact technical details described are:

* The use of private vehicles to serve multiple customers by avoiding long detours.
* The allocation of lanes for each vehicle to minimize travel time and distance traveled.
* The integration of private vehicles into the general urban mobility system using infrastructure such as streets with varying hierarchies (e.g., residential, commercial, pedestrian-friendly areas).

The parameters and processes described include:

* Mathematical modeling techniques to optimize routes and allocate lanes
* Advanced simulation models that incorporate various factors affecting ride duration and efficiency
* Heuristic optimization methods to identify the most efficient way to serve multiple customers using private vehicles

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by explaining how meeting points can benefit ridesharing systems in terms of:

* Reducing travel time for passengers
* Improving user satisfaction through faster service
* Enhancing overall system efficiency and performance
* Integrating with existing urban mobility systems to promote sustainable transportation options.

The specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned are:

* The need for efficient routing and allocation of lanes to minimize travel time and distance traveled
* The importance of integrating private vehicles into the general urban mobility system to leverage infrastructure such as streets with varying hierarchies.
* The potential benefits of meeting points in ridesharing systems, including improved efficiency, user satisfaction, and overall system performance.
