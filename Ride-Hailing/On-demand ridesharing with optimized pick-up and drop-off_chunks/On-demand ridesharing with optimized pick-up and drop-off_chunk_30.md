**Original Text:**

When deciding which are the feasible sequences, a decision needs to be taken regarding an inevitable trade-off between the costs
explained so far and the so-called unreliability of the system. In fact, Fielbaum and Alonso-Mora (2020) define the “one-time unreli­
ability” as the discomfort faced by users when the realization of their trips differ from what was originally predicted: each time a
vehicle’s route is updated, some of its previous passengers might face an additional delay, which can be annoying. If these changes are
limited in order to make the system more reliable, the number of feasible updated routes decreases, leading to less efficient solutions.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the specific text chunk:

**Technical details, parameters, or processes described:**

- Mathematical modeling and decomposition methods for ridesharing problems with flexible pickup and delivery locations.
- Analysis of meeting points in ride-sharing systems.

**Connection to or building upon the surrounding context:**

- The current text chunk is connected to the broader discussion of ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems, specifically focusing on the challenges and opportunities in managing such systems.
- It builds upon previous discussions by highlighting the importance of meeting points, which are mentioned in various papers throughout the reference list.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

- The trade-off between the costs and unreliability of a system is essential, as discussed in Fielbaum and Alonso-Mora (2020).
- The feasibility sequences and potential delays caused by updating vehicle routes are necessary considerations for efficient solutions.
- Limitations on the number of feasible updated routes due to increased unreliability lead to less efficient solutions.

Overall, this text chunk explains that ridesharing systems must balance the costs of modeling and optimization with the potential unreliability introduced by meeting points. It also acknowledges the importance of considering these trade-offs in determining optimal solutions for such systems.
