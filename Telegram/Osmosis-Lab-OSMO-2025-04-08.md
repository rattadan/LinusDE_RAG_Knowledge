## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions.

Starting from the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot promoting their support site. That's important for users needing help. Then mikebarb mentions a Twitter Space from Babylonlabs that he hasn't checked yet but plans to. The link is provided, so maybe that's an event or discussion they should note.

norrisherr just asks for a link, which might be related to the previous message. link_vector says yesterday's Twitter Space with Babylon was awesome, so that's a positive feedback on the event. Criptoruim is advertising Cosmicagenda for Cosmos events, listing a Twitter account and a website. That's a resource for event tracking.

jasbanza complains about CG's new logo, showing dissatisfaction. Yusungsang shares another link, probably a Twitter status. writtleVC is looking for moderators and managers for a DAO project, offering a salary range and contact info. That's a job opening.

Mrtiahou and jasbanza have a conversation about the Osmosis mobile app and Polaris. Mrtiahou likes Polaris design and suggests it should be the main app, while jasbanza isn't sure if the mobile app is released yet and asks for a link to verify. So the key points here are the discussion around the mobile app's status and the preference for Polaris.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements without getting bogged down in details. Mention the support site, the Twitter Space event, the job offer, the Cosmicagenda promotion, the logo complaint, and the mobile app discussion. Also note that Mrtiahou and jasbanza are questioning the app's release status and design choice. Keep it brief but cover all main points.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's about visiting a support site. The main topic here is support or help resources. Then mikebarb mentions a Twitter Space link from Babylonlabs, so that's Twitter Spaces and Babylon. The next one by norrisherr is asking for a link, which relates to the previous message, so maybe the same topic applies here.

Link_Vector talks about yesterday's Twitter Space with Babylon being awesome. So again, Twitter Spaces and Babylon are important. Criptoruim shares a link to Cosmicagenda, which is about Cosmos events, so topics here would be Cosmos events, Spaces, calls, launches, meetups. They also mention following to stay updated, so maybe community engagement or event tracking.

Jasbanza mentions CG (CoinGecko?) having a new logo, so that's a topic about CoinGecko logo change. Yusungsang shares a link to their Twitter status, but without context, it's hard to tell the topic. However, since it's a link to their own status, maybe it's related to their personal updates or possibly the same as other Twitter-related topics.

WrittleVC is looking for moderators and managers for a DAO project, offering payment. The topics here are DAO moderation, community management, job opportunities. Mrtiahou comments on Polaris design, so Polaris app design. Jasbanza again questions the mobile app release, so Osmosis mobile app release status.

Mrtiahou then suggests Polaris as the main Osmosis mobile app, so that's Polaris as Osmosis app. Jasbanza asks for a link to verify, which ties back to the same topic. The last message from Mrtiahou is about the Osmosis mobile app being Polaris, so again that topic.

Now, compiling all these topics, making sure to avoid duplicates. Let's see:

- Support site (https://support.osmosis.zone)
- Twitter Spaces (mentioned by link_Vector and mikebarb and norrisherr)
- Babylon (Babylonlabs_io)
- Cosmic events (Cosmicagenda)
- CoinGecko logo change (CG new logo)
- DAO moderation (writtle

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start by reading each one carefully.

The first message is from osmosis_statbot providing a support link. It's just a helpful message, so probably neutral. Then mikebarb says "this is it. Haven't listened yet either. Will check it out soon" with a link. The sentiment here seems neutral to positive since they mention they'll check it out, which is a positive action, but not overly enthusiastic.

norrisherr just says "Link pleasr" which is a typo for "please" but they're asking for a link, so neutral. link_vector mentions yesterday's Twitter Space was awesome. "Awesome" is clearly positive. Criptoruim shares a link about Cosmos events, which seems neutral as it's informative.

jasbanza posts "CG has a new logo... whyyyyyyyyyy" with a lot of y's. The elongated "why" might indicate frustration or annoyance, so that's likely negative. Yusungsang shares a link without any text, so neutral. writtleVC is looking for moderators and managers, offering payment. That's a neutral job posting.

Mrtiahou says "I like Polaris design for real" ‚Äì "like" is positive. jasbanza again mentions the mobile app not being released yet, which is neutral. Then Mrtiahou says Polaris is good to be the main app, which is positive. jasbanza asks for a link to verify, neutral. Finally, Mrtiahou asks if it's Osmosis or Polaris, neutral.

So compiling all these, I need to list each with their sentiment. Some might be tricky, like the job post ‚Äì it's not positive or negative, just informative. The "why" from jasbanza is a complaint, so negative. The rest are either neutral or positive based on the language used. I should make sure not to misinterpret any sarcasm or context, but there's not much here. Alright, let's put it all together.
</think>

Here‚Äôs the sentiment analysis of each message in the text:

1. **osmosis_statbot**: Neutral (provides a support link without emotional tone).  
2. **mikebarb**: Neutral/Positive (mentions intent to check out content but no

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. I need to go through each message and identify what's actionable or a decision.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a link to the support site. Maybe that's just informational, not an action item unless someone needs to visit it. But since it's a bot message, perhaps it's a reminder or a resource, but not sure if there's an action here. Maybe not, unless someone is supposed to do something with that link.

Next, mikebarb says "this is it. Haven't listened yet either. Will check it out soon" along with a Twitter link. The action here is that he plans to check out the Twitter Space. So the next step is him listening to it.

Then norrisherr says "Link pleasr" (probably a typo for 'please'). They're asking for a link, so that's a request. The next step would be someone providing the link they need.

link_vector mentions the Twitter Space from Babylon was awesome. No action here, just a comment.

Criptoruim shares a Cosmic Agenda post with links. The action items here might be following the Twitter account and visiting the website. So the next steps for others would be to follow and check the site.

jasbanza complains about CG's new logo. Not an action item unless someone is supposed to address his concern, but there's no decision mentioned.

writtleVC is looking for moderators and managers for a DAO project, offering payment. The action items here are seeking recommendations or expressions of interest. So the next steps are people applying or suggesting candidates.

Yusungsang shares a link to his Twitter status. Maybe someone needs to check that link, but unless specified, not sure if there's an action. Probably not unless the context requires it.

Mrtiahou likes Polaris design. Again, a comment, no action.

jasbanza says the mobile app isn't released yet. Just a statement, no action.

Mrtiahou suggests Polaris should be the main Osmosis app. That's an opinion, maybe leading to a decision if others agree, but not a confirmed decision here.

jasbanza asks for a link to verify something. So he's requesting a link, which is an action item for someone else to provide.

Mrtiahou is asking
