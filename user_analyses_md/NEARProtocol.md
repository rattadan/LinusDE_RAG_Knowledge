- Use of crypto community lingo like "gm" (good morning), "iykyk" (if you know you know)
- Informative yet promotional when announcing partnerships or technical developments
- Brief and punchy statements with short phrases and line breaks
- Futuristic orientation with emphasis on "soon" for upcoming features

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
The account appears legitimate based on:
- Official NEAR Protocol handle with verified checkmark
- Technical accuracy in references to blockchain concepts
- Partnership announcements that make sense in the crypto/blockchain space

- Integrations with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Zcash
- AI applications on blockchain
- Self-custodial and permissionless features
- Technical developments like EdDSA implementation

5. Evaluation of the author's character:
The account represents NEAR Protocol's official communication, so the "character" is more of a brand persona, which includes:
- Personality traits: Technical, enthusiastic, forward-looking, community-oriented
- Potential motivations and values: Promoting blockchain adoption, fostering decentralization, supporting AI development on blockchain, encouraging self-custody
- Emotional patterns and tendencies: Consistently positive, excited about developments, motivational
- Decision-making approach: Strategic in highlighting key developments, timing tweets for maximum impact (anniversary of Transformer paper), focusing on both technical and community aspects

Putting these tweets in bigger context of the account's intentions:
The NEAR Protocol account is strategically marketing their blockchain platform by:
1. Celebrating important AI research milestones to position NEAR as the "blockchain for AI"
