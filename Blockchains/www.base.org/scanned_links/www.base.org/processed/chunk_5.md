# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_5.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.base.org/*

### Document Overview  
This content outlines Base's commitment to on-chain technology, emphasizing scalability, usability, and open-source principles, while discussing initiatives like L2 rollups and user interfaces for decentralized applications (DApps).  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **On-chain platform**: A decentralized infrastructure for building and executing applications on blockchain.  
- **L2 rollups (EIP4844)**: Layer 2 scaling solutions that enable high throughput and low transaction costs for Ethereum.  
- **Open-source**: The platform’s commitment to free, transparent code and collaboration.  
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: The development of financial applications (e.g., exchanges, wallets) to enable peer-to-peer transactions.  
- **User interfaces (UI/UX)**: Tools like Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, and Rainbow that simplify on-chain interactions.  
- **Phase 4**: The plan to rebuild the financial system on open networks, prioritizing scalability and security.  

### Implementation Details  
- **EIP4844 (Optimism)**: A Layer 2 rollup protocol on Optimism that enables Ethereum-based applications to scale via sidechains.  
- **Open-source frameworks**: Base’s platform is designed to be open-source, allowing developers to build and customize applications.  
- **User interfaces**: Tools like Coinbase Wallet and Metamask are highlighted as examples of how Base aims to simplify on-chain access for non-technical users.  
- **Scalability solutions**: L2 rollups (e.g., Optimism) and on-chain apps (e.g., USDC, cbETH) are emphasized as critical for enabling mass adoption.  

### Related Topics  
- **Phase 4 of the plan**: The document connects to the broader goal of rebuilding the financial system on open, decentralized networks.  
- **Decentralized finance (DeFi)**: Base’s focus on DeFi applications (e.g., exchanges, wallets) aligns with the text’s discussion of user interfaces and investment mechanisms.  
- **Open-source movement**: The platform’s commitment to open-source reflects the documentation’s emphasis on collaboration and transparency.  
- **Layer 2 solutions**: The mention of EIP4844 and Optimism ties to the technical details of Base’s scalability strategy.

around each protocol and early adopters began experimenting with how they could be used.

Coinbase started here. Investment or speculation is a bootstrapping mechanism for a payment network (in other words, it is thesingle-player modeof digital currency). And the creation of safe and easy to use exchanges served as abridgefor people to get their local currency into and out of digital currency.

To move beyond just exchange and investment, consumers and businesses needed an easy interface to start using digital currency and its applications. Countless applications have been built to let anyone, anywhere access the nascent cryptoeconomy, including Coinbase, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, and others.

With the interfaces in place, our existing financial system now needs to be recreated on open networks and made globally accessible. Were seeing this happen in front of our eyes: USDC has brought billions of dollars onchain, cbETH enables holders anywhere to secure the financial system while earning rewards, and hundreds of onchain apps are enabling countless individuals and institutions to transact with lower fees, more security, and unparalleled access.

We've had countless conversations about how we can accelerate Phase 4 of this plan with both internal teams and external collaborators. The takeaway is that in order to unlock the scale, usability, and security needed for the final phase, we actually need to go back to the beginning: developing the underlying protocols that enable the end user applications.

We started by doing this on Ethereum, drivingEIP4844with Optimism to enable L2 rollups to scale.But we don't believe that's enough, so here we are.

Base is our all in commitment to onchain.

We believe that the onchain platform is the most important builder platform since the internet (online). We believe that the onchain platform should be open source, free to use, and globally available.
