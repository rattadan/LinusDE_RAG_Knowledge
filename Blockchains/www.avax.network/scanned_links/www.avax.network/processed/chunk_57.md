The future of the Internet is decentralized. Weâre moving from the walled gardens of Web 2.0 to a model that gives developers and users more control over their services, identities and data.Â

If youâre a Web 2.0 developer with an eye on blockchain, thereâs one big thing to know: Itâs a whole new world. Expect to encounter new tools, concepts, design philosophies and challenges.

Our latest guide,The Ultimate Guide to Becoming a Blockchain Developer, is here to help. Whether youâre an experienced engineer or a curious hobbyist or anywhere in between, this guide is a comprehensive roadmap.

Blockchain and decentralized apps (dApps) offer a wide array of benefits over traditional software development:

It all adds up to exciting opportunities for developers and the ever-expanding base of blockchain users.

This guide is meant to familiarize you with the core concepts and tools youâll need to develop on blockchain. Hereâs a quick preview:

The guide starts by explaining how Web3 differs from previous internet eras:

Web1 (Static Web):Read-only websites with limited interaction.

Web2 (Social Web):User-generated content, centralized platforms, and data ownership by corporations.

Web3 (Decentralized Web):Blockchain-based applications that remove intermediaries and give users control over data and assets.

To effectively develop for blockchain, you need to understand how decentralized networks function. This guide explores:

Web3 development requires a new set of tools. This guide outlines:

As blockchain applications grow, developers need to address scalability and compatibility issues. These challenges must be addressed to avoid high gas fees, traffic congestion and security breaches.Â

How can you be sure youâre fully ready to build on blockchain?
