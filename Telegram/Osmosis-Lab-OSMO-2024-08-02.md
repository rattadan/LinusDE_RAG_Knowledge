## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the provided chat messages and pick out the key points and decisions. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the most important information without getting bogged down by casual banter or less relevant comments.

Starting from the top, there's the osmosis_statbot messages. They list official links for support, documentation, community platforms like Discord, Telegram, etc., and a warning about Keplr's Telegram channels being scams. That's crucial info to include because it's about security and official resources.

Then BasementNodes and oldi6 are discussing payouts related to epochs, a specific pool (CDT/osmo), APR of 65%, and the token involved (umbrn). They mention the start time, duration, remaining days, and amount. This seems like a key point about staking or liquidity pool incentives, so I should note the pool details, APR, payout schedule, and the token.

Other messages from joey19944 and oldi6 talk about earnings, market conditions ("global recession"), and some references to other projects like Kujira and TheLionDAO. The user mentions that $COOK revenue comes from memecoins, and there's a DAO earning fees on Osmosis and Injective. Also, a link to a Streamswap page for $COOK. This part is about the financial aspects and partnerships, so I should include the revenue sources, DAO activities, and the platforms involved.

There's a question from Metamo0n about how the 10 million $COOK will be divided, specifically if it's based on deposit time. That's a point about distribution mechanics which is important for users considering participation.

Formione's message highlights features of $COOK, including revenue streams and live streams/lockdrops. The mention of Flamb√© and burning raffles adds to the DAO's initiatives. These are key points about the token's benefits and ongoing projects.

Other messages are more casual, like jokes or personal comments, which probably shouldn't be included unless they relate to decisions or key info. For example, "nothing is dead" or "heres your carpeter" are likely just banter.

I also notice some references to other tokens and platforms (e.g., Keplr, LeapWallet, Streamswap). Including the official wallets and partners is relevant for users to know where to interact securely.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from the given text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand what's going on.

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot providing official links like the support site, app, docs, and various social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Telegram, Instagram, Medium, YouTube, GitHub, etc.). Then another message from the same bot about visiting the support site. So the first main topic here seems to be "Official Links and Support" related to Osmosis.

Next, BasementNodes and oldi6 are discussing payouts, epochs, AMM pools, and specific tokens like mbrn. There's mention of pool numbers, durations, amounts, and incentives. This looks like discussions around "Token Pools and Incentives" or something related to DeFi pools and rewards.

There's a part where users talk about a potential global recession and its impact, so "Global Recession Impact" might be another topic. Also, some messages mention other projects like Kujira and Zondax, indicating discussions about other Cosmos-related projects or competitors.

Formione mentions start.cooking, memecoins, DAO fees, and links to platforms like Streamswap and Savanna Money. This seems related to "Memecoins and DAO Revenue Streams," focusing on specific projects and their financial models.

Some messages have warnings about scams, like the Keplr Telegram channel, which points to "Scam Awareness and Security." Users are being alerted about fake channels, so that's a relevant topic.

There's also a lot of casual banter and references to community interactions, like "rug pull" jokes, which might fall under "Community Discussions and Banter." These are more about the social aspects and user interactions.

Additionally, there's a mention of governance forums and GitHub repositories, which could relate to "Governance and Development." However, since the official links already include governance, maybe that's part of the first topic.

I should also note the specific tokens mentioned: OSMO, mbrn, COOK, SHITMOS, INJ, and others. But since the task is to extract main topics, not specific tokens, maybe those are part of the broader categories.

Putting it all together, the main topics seem to be:

1. Official Links and Support for Osmosis
2. Token Pools and In

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people. I need to go through each one and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Then, I'll summarize the overall sentiment.

First, I'll start by reading through each message carefully. Some messages are from bots, like osmosis_statbot, which just lists official links and support info. Those are probably neutral since they're factual and not expressing any emotion. Then there are user messages. For example, BasementNodes talks about payout epochs and AMM pools. That seems neutral too, just discussing technical details.

Looking at oldi6's messages: "If global recession hits will be carnage" ‚Äì that's negative. "For me is done" also sounds negative. But then there's "What is dead may never die" which might be neutral or even positive depending on context, but since it's in a chat where others are talking about things being dead, maybe neutral here.

Joey19944 says, "i'm still earning great" and "i'm not complaining" ‚Äì those are positive. Even though they mention a bear market, the sentiment is still positive because they're earning well.

Other messages like "nothing is dead" from joey19944 could be positive, countering negative thoughts. Then there's Svansy's "hello rugger" and "anal OS sounds nice ngl" ‚Äì "rugger" might be a joke or reference, so maybe neutral. The "anal OS" comment is a bit odd but seems like playful banter, so neutral.

Formione's message about $COOK seems positive with points about revenue and growth. Metamo0n's message is a correction about technical details, so neutral. Lostreply talks about financial recovery and waiting it out, which is negative. 

JohnnyWyles87's message about a coin not being around anymore is negative. BasementNodes mentions getting rekt and adulting not being fun, which are negative. Amx901 references a past incident (Kujira), which is negative. 

Putting it all together: There are several negative comments about financial states, carnage from recession, coins dying, getting rekt. Positive messages are fewer, like earning well. Neutral ones are the bot links and some technical discussions. The overall sentiment seems more negative because the majority of the user messages express concerns or negative

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The text is a series of chat messages from different users. Let me go through each message one by one.

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot with links to support and other official resources. The user is providing links, so maybe the action item here is to visit those sites, but the bot is just sharing information, not assigning a task. Then another statbot message with more links and a warning about Keplr's Telegram being a scam. Again, this seems like information sharing, not action items.

BasementNodes at 20:46:48 says "so the payout will be epochs yeah." Epochs in blockchain usually refer to a specific time period for rewards. So maybe the action item here is that payouts will be distributed every epoch. Then another message from BasementNodes confirming it's a traditional AMM pool. Not an action item, just info.

oldi6 at 20:45:38 mentions seeing paid mbrn token. Then BasementNodes gives details about a pool: Start Time, Duration, Remaining Days, Coin, Amount. This looks like a decision or next step: the pool details and duration. Maybe the action item here is to note the pool details and remaining days.

oldi6 asks about 65% being correct. Not sure what that refers to, but maybe a decision to confirm or verify that percentage. Then oldi6 says "I think is external incentive." That's a statement, not an action.

BasementNodes asks "what pool number" in response to oldi6's question about the CDT/osmo pool. So the next step might be to identify the specific pool number. oldi6's message about the CDT/osmo pool includes questions about boost payments (every epoch? in what coin?), so maybe the action item is to clarify the payment schedule and token for the boost.

Other messages talk about global recession, personal financial situations, memes, and banter. Those don't seem to have action items. 

Formione at 12:08:22 talks about $COOK revenue, memecoins, and provides links to streamswap and savanna.money. This might include next steps like checking out those links for the streams and lockdrop.
