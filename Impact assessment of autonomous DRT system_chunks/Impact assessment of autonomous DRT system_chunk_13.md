## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 13

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

**Original Text:**

This number is slightly lower than the official data of the local
public transport operator (?), mainly because the model’s focus lies on work-related trips. The city’s current public
transport system consists of five tram lines and 13 regular city bus lines. The tram lines run in intervals of 15-20
minutes on weekdays, whereas the buses within the city run every 20 minutes to two hours. Services are limited
during weekends (?). The long intervals in the current public transport cause high waiting times and a low flexibility
when choosing the departure time. Additionally, some bus services operate only on request. The majority of these

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The text does not explicitly mention any specific requirements, conditions, or constraints. However, it implies that the simulation approach and data used in this chunk are based on existing public transportation infrastructure and services, which may have certain limitations (e.g., high waiting times during peak hours). Additionally, the study assumes a certain level of compatibility between the DRT system's operational parameters and those of traditional public transport services.

**Analysis Focus:**
