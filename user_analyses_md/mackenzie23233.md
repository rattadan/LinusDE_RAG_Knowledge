The tweets suggest that the author is a supporter of the Coreum blockchain project, highlighting its technical performance (block time), practical applications, and community partnerships. The author appears to be amplifying positive messages about Coreum through strategic retweets, rather than creating original content. This behavior is typical of community members who want to support a project's growth and visibility.
