**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

----------------------------------------------

When you lock up your ATOM to gain voting power on Hydro, your ATOM is converted into Liquid Staking Module (LSM) shares, which are then sent to the Hydro contract. You haven’t lost any ATOM; it’s just been converted into LSM shares representing your stake in the system. You won’t be able to vote in Cosmos Hub governance with the staked ATOM that you converted to LSM shares. You are now using that ATOM to participate in Hydro governance. ## Am I still eligible for airdrops? ---------------------------------

You may or may not still be eligible for airdrops for the staked ATOM that you converted to LSM shares. Some projects may not query your LSM shares. However, Hydro will feature an airdrop endpoint for projects to query, and the Hydro team will work with the Cosmos core teams to update the documentation to include this information for future projects.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Text Chunk**

1. **Technical Details and Parameters**:
   - The text explains that users' staked ATOM is converted into Liquid Staking Module (LSM) shares when they lock up their ATOM to gain voting power on Hydro.
   - LSM shares are sent to the Hydro contract, and the ATOM itself hasn't been lost; it's just been converted.
   - The process involves users no longer using their staked ATOM to vote in Cosmos Hub governance but instead using their LSM shares to participate in Hydro governance.

2. **Connection to the Surrounding Context**:
   - The text builds upon the information provided about HM locks, voting power, and user participation in Hydro governance.
   - It offers clarification on how users' staked ATOM is converted into LSM shares, allowing them to participate in Hydro governance.

3. **Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints**:
   - Users may or may not be eligible for airdrops if they've converted their staked ATOM to LSM shares.
   - Hydro will feature an airdrop endpoint for projects to query, and the Hydro team will work with Cosmos core teams to update documentation.

**Key Facts and Implications in the Text Chunk**:

- Converting staked ATOM to LSM shares doesn't result in a loss of the ATOM itself.
- This conversion process allows users to participate in Hydro governance using their LSM shares.
- Eligibility for airdrops is uncertain for users who've made this conversion.

The text chunk is primarily an explanation of how users' staked ATOM is converted into LSM shares and its implications on user participation in Hydro governance.
