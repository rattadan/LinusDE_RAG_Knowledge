How to Trade Based on Moving Averages? MA, SMA, EMA, WMA Crypto Trading Strategies

Crypto Moving Average Trading Strategy #1: Trend
The MA gives an immediate idea of the trend. By analyzing the direction of the Moving Average indicator we can easily see if the price is making new highs. The tip of the indicator, the outer end, also will show the possible future direction. Trend traders generally accumulate when the price hits significant moving averages. Significant means the ones with the most data, for example, 100 MA or 200 MA, which are rarely touched. Crypto Moving Average Trading Strategy #2: Combining MA’s
Many traders enjoy seeing multiple MA’s on the same chart. This gives the benefit of seeing the long-term trend and the short-term trend at the same time. Anything is possible, from 2 MA’s to a triple MA or even a whole band, or Moving Average Ribbon. As long as you are understand the information, you can read its signals and decide how to trade the market.
