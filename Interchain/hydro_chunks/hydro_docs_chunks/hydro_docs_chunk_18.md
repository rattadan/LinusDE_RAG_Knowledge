**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

The APR changes as more users vote or lock their ATOM or as bidders increase their tributes. It is nearly guaranteed that you will have an APR that is more or less than the number displayed. Some bids use points rather than tradable tokens, which can influence the APR. The APR calculation assumes tributes are paid in tokens that can be traded or sold. ### Historical APR
--------------

After the first pilot round, Hydro will start displaying historical APRs. These will likely give users a more realistic view of the expected end-of-round performance. The historical APR is calculated based on the average Hydro voter APR of the last round.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analyzing the Text Chunk:**

1.  **Exact Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes Described:**
    -   The APR calculation takes into account changes in user activity (voting or locking ATOM) and bid activity (presence of tributes).
    -   The APR calculation assumes tributes are paid in tradable tokens.
    -   Historical APRs are calculated based on the average Hydro voter APR of the last round.
2.  **Connection to Surrounding Context:**
    -   The APR is a key component in the Hydro platform, influencing user decision-making.
    -   The text chunk builds upon the explanation of APRs in the section "APRs and Rewards."
    -   The concept of "treasuries," which stores yields generated by the liquidity, is mentioned, connecting this text chunk to the overall Hydro ecosystem.
3.  **Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints Mentioned:**
    -   The APR calculation assumes tributes are paid in tradable tokens.
    -   Historical APRs will be calculated after the first pilot round.
    -   The formula for historical APRs is not explicitly mentioned, leaving it as a calculation based on the average Hydro voter APR of the last round.

**Objective Analysis of the Section:**

This section is explaining how the Additional Yield from tributes (also known as Voter APR) calculated under certain conditions regarding the form of the tributes (tradable token) and showing information about displaying historical Average Yield (Historical APRs in its results) - the section does not clearly define how historical APRs are calculated
