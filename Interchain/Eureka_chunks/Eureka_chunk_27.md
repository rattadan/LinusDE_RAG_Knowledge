## Eureka - Chunk 27

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

​
Query Messages
Exposes a “Swap Exact In Simulation” method where a user can put the inputs that would be used in the “Swap Exact In” execution method, and gets a response from the query that specifies the asset they would receive if executing the method (see Osmosis for a module example, or Astroport for a contract example). Exposes a “Swap Exact Out Simulation” method where a user can input the asset desired and a given pool / path, and the query returns the asset required to swap in to receive the output asset desired (see Osmosis for a module example, or Astroport for a contract example). ​
Getting Skip to add support for your DEX
If your DEX and the chain its deployed on meets all of the functionality requirements described above, please fill out this support request form and submit it to support@skip.build or TG:@bpiv400.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is explaining the technical details and processes involved in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on:

1. **Technical Details**: 
   - The exact parameters and processes described include:
     + Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) timeout and slippage rules.
     + Slow relaying from Axelar's Relay service causing timeouts.
     + Slippage issues in the Axelar GMP protocol.
     + Potential failure points for the Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), including reliance on the attestation service, its outage leading to funds being inaccessible, and users needing to wait until the service recovers before their funds are available.
     - The specific requirements and conditions mentioned include:
       + Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) standards for successful transfers.
       + Timeliness of transactions in cross-chain asset transfers.
   - The processes described include:
     + Query Messages, which expose methods for simulating swap operations to help with testing and development.

2. **Context Connection**:
   This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing an overview of potential failure points and technical details related to various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, including IBC, Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), and Hyperlane.

3. **Requirements and Constraints**:
   The current text chunk also includes recommendations for user education, risk management, and developer best practices to help mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

The specific requirements mentioned include:
- Providing a support request form if the DEX and its deployed chain meet all the functionality requirements described above.
- Ensuring that queries can execute successfully without encountering errors due to protocol timeouts or slippage issues.
