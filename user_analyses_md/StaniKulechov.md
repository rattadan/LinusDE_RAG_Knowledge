## Overview

<think>
I need to analyze these tweets from Stani.eth (Stani Kulechov) to understand the main themes, language style, legitimacy, any projects being advertised, and insights about his character. Let me go through these tweets systematically.

   - "Just build on Aave"
   - "Build on Aave"
   - Multiple mentions of Aave's metrics like net deposits, TVL, and specific Aave-related products

2. DeFi growth and comparison: Some tweets compare traditional finance with DeFi, emphasizing the growth and significance:
   - "SoFi: $36B AUM, business managed by a corporate board. Aave: $42B net deposits, infrastructure governed by a DAO"
   - "New week, new all-time high. $40.3 billion net deposits"
