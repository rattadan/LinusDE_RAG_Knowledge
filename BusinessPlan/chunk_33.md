service fees. Compared to the 20%-30% commission fee charged per ride by other platforms. On average,
this costs drivers in the UK between £1K-£1.5K per month. In addition to these cost savings, drivers
using the nRide application can name their prices, giving them greater control over their earnings. PARTNERSHIP HIGHLIGHT
