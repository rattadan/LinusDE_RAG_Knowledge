**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're referring to a research paper titled "Simulating Traffic Flow Using the Discrete Recurrent Traffic Model" by Ihab Kaddoura and colleagues, published in 2020. The authors used this model to simulate traffic flow under various conditions.

The question seems to be asking for an analysis or interpretation of the results from these simulations, specifically when compared to a base case where there is no Dynamic Routing Table (DRT) mode and no car tolls.
