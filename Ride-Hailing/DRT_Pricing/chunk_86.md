**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're referring to research papers related to transportation, specifically on the topic of shared autonomous vehicles and their impact on the transportation industry.

The paper "Towards welfare optimal operation of innovative mobility concepts: External cost pricing in a world of shared autonomous vehicles" by Kaddoura et al. (2018) is notable for exploring the concept of external cost pricing as a potential tool to optimize the operation of shared autonomous vehicles.

External cost pricing, also known as congestion pricing or user charges, is a policy strategy used to manage traffic and transportation demand through economic means, rather than simply regulating traffic flow using physical barriers, signs, or signal control. By charging drivers a fee for using certain roads or routes during peak hours, governments can influence the behavior of drivers and promote more efficient use of road capacity.

In the context of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), external cost pricing could be used to charge riders a fee for using the service, potentially reducing congestion, increasing fuel efficiency, and improving overall traffic flow. This approach has been proposed by researchers like Kaddoura et al., who suggest that it can help optimize the operation of SAVs in various scenarios.

If you're interested in learning more about this topic or exploring research papers related to transportation policy and economics, I recommend checking out the Institut für angewandte Sozialwissenschaften (IAS) at the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DZS), which is mentioned in your initial query.
