## Overview

<think>
Okay, so I need to analyze this tweet. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking. The tweet is about OpenAI being silent on MCP (maybe a specific technology or feature) and how Claude has integrated it. The user is questioning why OpenAI isn't doing the same.

First, the main topics here are OpenAI's lack of support for MCP and the comparison with Claude. The user is probably interested in the technical aspects of AI models and their features. They might be a developer or someone involved in AI, looking for updates or features.

Next, the language style is straightforward and inquisitive. The user is asking a question, which is direct. The tone is curious and possibly critical, pointing out a discrepancy between OpenAI and Claude. There's a bit of frustration implied because OpenAI isn't supporting MCP, which the user is noticing in Claude.

For legitness, the user is questioning the official stance of OpenAI. They might be skeptical about OpenAI's approach or maybe they're trying to verify if the information is accurate. The mention of Claude suggests they're comparing different AI services, so the user is probably well-informed about different platforms.

The account isn't explicitly advertising a specific ecosystem, but the user is discussing OpenAI and Claude, which are different projects. So maybe the account is just sharing information about these companies.

In terms of the author's character, the communication is direct and focused on technical details. The personality traits might include being analytical, tech-savvy, and possibly critical of companies that don't meet certain standards. The motivation could be to keep up with the latest developments in AI or to advocate for certain features. The emotional pattern seems to be curiosity and a bit of concern about OpenAI's lack of support. Decision-making is likely based on factual information and comparisons between different AI systems.

Putting it all together, the user is likely an AI enthusiast or developer who's tracking updates in the AI space, particularly interested in how different companies are implementing features. They might be trying to influence or inform others about the differences between OpenAI and Claude, possibly to highlight a feature they find important. The keywords would be related to AI, OpenAI, Claude, MCP, and technical features.

| messages | Any reason why OpenAI is so silent about MCP and integrating it with their desktop app or support for remote MCPs in the web-app?

Claude seems to have enabled both. |
