## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on the key points and decisions. Let me start by going through each message and identifying the main topics.

First, there's a lot of discussion about transferring USDC between different chains like Cronos, Solana, and Osmosis. Users are having issues with routes and liquidity. For example, Sardon70 can't move USDC from Cronos to Solana, and kychuli explains that they need to go through CRO first. Then there's kreativ0ff who transferred USDC from Solana to Osmosis but can't swap them, and kychuli suggests using Wormhole and Skip to get Noble USDC. So the key points here are the transfer issues, the need for specific bridges like Skip and Wormhole, and liquidity problems with certain tokens.

Next, there's a mention of Mesh Security and Alloyed Assets Dashboard by RoboMcGobo. He says Mesh's backend funding is done, but it's not launching soon because of Polaris. The Alloyed Assets Dashboard is almost ready, with a GitHub link. Martyvb is asking about the grant spending on Mesh and other projects, expressing skepticism about their outcomes. He also has technical issues with the Osmosis app, like loading screens and pool labeling. Khuwarzmi and others mention checking with the team and provide a pool link.

Then there's a part about Kujira being "cremated" and discussions on Osmosis's performance, with users noting it's near its all-time low. Some mention the need for Osmosis to focus on simple features post-Polaris, like native perps and front-page charts. There's also a question about airdrops for OSMO holders, which kychuli says there haven't been any notable ones recently.

I need to group these into categories: token transfers/liquidity issues, project updates (Mesh, Alloyed Dashboard), community concerns (OSMO price, Kujira), technical problems with the app, and discussions on future features. Also, note the support link provided by the statbot.

Decisions or key points would be the steps needed to transfer USDC (using specific bridges), the status of Mesh and Alloyed Dashboard, the liquidity issues on certain pools, the skepticism around grant spending, and the community's frustration with the platform's current state and Kujira's collapse.

I should make sure to

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as comma-separated. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects being discussed.

Starting with the first few messages, there's a mention of USDC transfers from Cronos to Solana and Osmosis, and issues with liquidity. Sardon70 and kychuli are talking about how USDC can't be sent directly to Solana from Cronos and that you need to go through CRO first. Then there's a link shared by kychuli about sending USDC from Solana to Osmosis using wormhole and skip.build. Another user, kreativ0ff, had trouble swapping USDC to OSMO after transferring from Solana and was directed to use portalbridge or wormhole. So, a main topic here is USDC transfers between chains, specifically involving Cronos, Solana, and Osmosis, and the associated liquidity issues.

Then there's a question about recent airdrops for Osmo holders. User_1320734130 asks if there were any recent airdrops, and kychuli responds that it's been a while since a notable one. So "airdrops for Osmo holders" is another topic.

Moving on, oldi6 mentions Kujira being "cremated," which I think is slang for it failing or being dead. Fuerzaaaaa asks if Kujira is dead, and kychuli talks about the lack of liquidity for USDC.sol.wh. So "Kujira's status" could be a topic here.

There's a discussion about Mesh Security. RoboMcGobo talks about funding for Mesh's backend work being the last from OGP, and martyvb questions the allocation of OSMO to Mesh Security. So "Mesh Security funding and development" is a key topic.

Another part involves oldi6 suggesting Osmosis should implement simple features like native perps and charts on the front page after releasing Polaris. So "Native perpetuals (perps)" and "Front page features" are topics here.

Then there's a mention of the Alloyed Assets Dashboard. RoboMcGobo says it's close to being done, and Khuwarzmi refers to a tweet with a dashboard link. So "Alloyed Assets Dashboard" is another

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this chat log. Let me start by reading through all the messages carefully. 

First, the text has several users discussing Osmosis and related topics. There are technical questions about transferring USDC from Cronos to Solana or Osmosis, some positive comments about services like Skip being awesome, and a few negative remarks about the state of the platform or ecosystem.

Looking at the positive sentiments: Sardon70 says "Fast and cheap" and "Wow!!!! Really awesome," and kychuli mentions "Skip is awesome." Those are clearly positive. Also, the osmosis_statbot provides neutral support links, but the user responses to that are positive.

Negative sentiments: Sardon70 and others mention issues with transferring USDC, lack of routes, no liquidity, which are negative. Kreativ0ff says "It doesn‚Äôt work" and refers to scammers, which is negative. There's a comment about "Mesh security is just wasted money" and another about Osmosis almost touching ATL (all-time low), which are negative. The mention of "everything is dead" and "Kujira cremated" also adds to the negative tone.

Neutral parts: Some messages are factual or procedural, like sharing links or explaining steps to transfer tokens. The discussion about the Alloyed Assets Dashboard and Mesh security funding details are informational, so neutral. Also, questions like "Is it safe?" are neutral unless the context implies a problem, but the user hasn't received an answer yet.

There's a mix of positive and negative, but the negative comments seem more frequent and detailed. The technical issues, lack of liquidity, and frustration from users like kreativ0ff and oldi6's comments about wasted money and needing to copy other DEX models indicate dissatisfaction. However, some users do appreciate certain aspects like Skip's service.

I should also note that some messages are about ongoing challenges and funding, which might not be positive or negative but more about the current state. The overall sentiment seems to lean negative because of the multiple complaints and issues raised, but there are pockets of positive feedback. The neutral parts are the support messages and some technical explanations.

Wait, but the user is asking for a single sentiment classification: positive, negative, or neutral. Since there are both positive and negative elements, but the negative ones are more prominent with users facing problems and expressing frustration, maybe the overall sentiment is negative.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll need to go through each message carefully and see what's being discussed. 

Starting from the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's probably an action item for users needing help. Then, looking at kychuli and Sardon70's conversation about transferring USDC from Cronos to Solana or Osmosis. Sardon70 mentions they can't send USDC to Solana, and kychuli explains that they need to go through CRO first. There's a link provided to skip.build for sending to Solana, which might be a next step. Also, kychuli suggests using portalbridge.com to send back to Solana with wormhole. So those links and steps are actionable.

Another part is kychuli advising to send USDC back to Solana using wormhole and then using Skip to get Noble USDC. That's a process someone would need to follow. Then there's a user, kreativ0ff, who transferred USDC to Osmosis but can't use it. kychuli mentions there's no liquidity for usdc.sol.wh, so the next step here might be to use a different method or check liquidity sources.

Looking at the later messages, there's discussion about Mesh security funding and the status of the Alloyed Assets Dashboard. RoboMcGobo says the dashboard is almost done, with code open-sourced. So the next step here could be the Osmosis team adding it to their domain. Also, Martyvb is asking about grant-funded projects, like Mesh Security and liquidity distribution visibility. These might indicate action items for the team to provide updates or summaries.

There's also a mention of charts on the front page and native perps, which oldi6 suggests Osmosis should focus on after releasing Polaris. That's a recommendation, so maybe a decision point for the team to prioritize those features.

I need to make sure I capture all the actionable items, like using specific tools (Skip, Wormhole, portalbridge), checking liquidity, contacting support, and team decisions about future features (Mesh Security, Alloyed Assets Dashboard, native perps). Also, any user steps they need to take, like swapping tokens first, or troubleshooting pool issues.

Wait, some messages
