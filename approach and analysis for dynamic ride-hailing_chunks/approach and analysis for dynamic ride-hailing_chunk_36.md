I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

The costs for
each matching are usually the distance or the travel time between the
current location of the vehicle and the pickup location of the respective
request. Infeasible matchings can be prevented, e.g., by setting the
associated costs to a sufficiently high value, so that the optimal solution
will always contain as many feasible assignments as possible. The basic
version of the assignment problem can be formulated as follows:
∑
min
𝑐𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑖𝑗
(2)
(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝐼×𝐽

subject to

∑

𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1

∀𝑖 ∈ 𝐼

(3)

𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1

∀𝑗 ∈ 𝐽

(4)

∀𝑖 ∈ 𝐼, 𝑗 ∈ 𝐽

(5)

𝑗∈𝐽

∑

Although not used in our study, we want to point out the potential
benefit of allowing voluntary rejections. In our paper, as well as most
other articles in the literature, rejecting a customer is only allowed
when a feasible assignment is not possible in time. However, each
request has an individual explicit and implicit reward structure. Not
only are the distances to the requests as well as the serving distances
different, but also the destinations.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the text chunk:

**1. Technical details, parameters, or processes described:**

The chunk describes the assignment problem, which is a classic NP-hard problem in operations research and computer science. The basic version of the assignment problem can be formulated as follows:

* ∑ min (𝑐𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑖𝑗) over (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝐼 × 𝐽 subject to:
  * ∑ 𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1 for all 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼
  * 𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1 for all 𝑗 ∈ 𝐽
* The goal is to minimize the total cost, which depends on the distances and travel times between different locations.

**2. Connection to or building upon the surrounding context:**

The text chunk builds upon the topic of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, as discussed in the provided references. The assignment problem is a fundamental component of these systems, and its solution can help optimize the matching process between requests and vehicles.

**3. Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

The text mentions several specific requirements, including:

* Infeasible matchings can be prevented by setting associated costs to a sufficiently high value
* The problem should always contain as many feasible assignments as possible
* Each request has an individual explicit and implicit reward structure

Additionally, the text notes that voluntary rejections may not be used in the study, but they are mentioned as a potential benefit of allowing customers to reject requests.
