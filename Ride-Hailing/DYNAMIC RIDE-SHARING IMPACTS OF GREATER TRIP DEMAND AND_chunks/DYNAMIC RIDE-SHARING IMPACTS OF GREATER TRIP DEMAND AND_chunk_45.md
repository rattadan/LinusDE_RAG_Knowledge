## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 45

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

PUDOs
without dedicated infrastructure may not be able to serve more than 5 travelers arriving in a 15min interval without adversely impacting surrounding travel times from blocking capacity, and
the consequent queue spillbacks. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text is explaining the technical details related to parking infrastructure for shared autonomous vehicle fleets.

Here's a breakdown of what this chunk is explaining:

* The exact technical detail being described is the capacity of Parking Utilization Oriented Systems (PUDOs) without dedicated infrastructure, which can only serve up to 5 travelers in 15 minutes without impacting surrounding travel times.
* Key parameters and processes related to PUDOs include:
	+ Congestion pricing: the inability to serve more than a certain number of travelers within a given time frame due to lack of infrastructure.
	+ Queue spillbacks: the consequence of not having enough space to handle all arriving passengers, leading to additional travel times for those waiting in line.

This chunk connects to and builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Providing specific technical details about PUDOs and their limitations
* Connecting to the broader topic of shared autonomous vehicle fleets and their potential impacts on urban transportation systems

The specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned include:

* The U.S. Department of Energy Vehicle Technologies Office's sponsorship of the project
* The need for dedicated infrastructure to serve a certain number of travelers within a given time frame (5 in 15 minutes)
* The importance of queue spillbacks and their consequences
