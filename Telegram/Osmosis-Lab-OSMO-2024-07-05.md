## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on the key points and decisions. Let me start by reading through the entire conversation to understand the context.

The chat seems to be about blockchain, specifically involving Osmosis, Migaloo, and other Cosmos-related chains. There are mentions of relayers, nodes, IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), and some technical issues with configurations. Users are discussing problems with transactions, losing funds, and checking rug pulls. Also, there's a proposal to clean up the CWPool whitelist and another to whitelist a deployer's address for contract uploads.

First, identify the main topics. There's a lot about relayers and nodes not working, leading to lost funds or failed transactions. Users like BasementNodes and Svansy are frustrated with the current setup, needing better RPCs or configurations. They mention using tools like grpcurl and a relayer configuration example. 

Then, there's a discussion about a user from Russia trying to acquire OSMO with rubles, which others say is difficult. Another thread involves RugChecker.xyz, a tool for checking rug pulls, which Svansy recommends. 

The governance proposals are also key points: one to remove legacy CosmWasm pools from the whitelist and another to allow Deploydon's address to upload contracts without governance approval each time. Deploydon is asking to be welcomed, and there's a mention of DAODAO integration for contract visibility.

Key decisions or actions here are the proposals related to the CWPool whitelist cleanup and Deploydon's contract upload whitelist. The technical issues around relayer configurations and node reliability are recurring problems. The user's concern about losing funds due to relayer issues and the suggestion to use RugChecker are important points.

I should structure the summary around these elements: the governance proposals, the technical challenges with relayers and nodes, the user's fund issues, the mention of tools like grpcui and RugChecker, and the discussion about fiat onboarding (rubles to OSMO). Also, the frustration with current configurations and the need for better tooling.

Need to make sure it's concise, so group similar points. Mention the main proposals, the technical problems affecting users, and the tools suggested. Avoid too much detail on specific commands unless they're key decisions. Highlight the critical issues like lost funds and lack of relayer support for certain chains.

Check for any other key points. There's a mention of Andromeda for

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided chat text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand what the text is about. 

Looking through the messages, there's a lot of discussion around blockchain and specifically Cosmos ecosystem. Terms like "nodes," "relayers," "IBC," "Osmosis," "Migaloo," "Andromeda," and "rugchecker" come up. Users are talking about technical issues related to running nodes, configuring relayers, and problems with transactions getting stuck or funds disappearing. There's mention of a support site and some commands related to GRPC and tools like grpcurl.

Then there's a part about a user from Russia trying to get OSMO tokens with Rubles, which seems to be a different topic but still related to the ecosystem. Also, discussions about contract uploads on Osmosis, whitelisting addresses, and proposals for cleaning up CWPool Whitelist. The rugcheck.xyz link is mentioned, which is a tool for checking rug pulls in DeFi projects.

I should identify the main topics here. Let me list them out:

1. Osmosis Support (the first message mentions the support site)
2. Node and Relayer Configuration Issues (BasementNodes talks about difficulties with configs and nodes)

3. IBC Relaying and Chain Compatibility (discussions about relaying between chains like Migaloo and Osmosis)

4. Cosmos Ecosystem Tools (mentions of grpcui, cosmology, rust tonic, etc.)

5. DeFi Security and Rug Pulls (rugcheck.xyz and discussions about rugchecker)

6. Andromeda Protocol (Svansy recommends checking out Andromeda for IBC smart contracts)

7. Contract Uploads and Governance Proposals (Deploydon's proposal to whitelist an address for contract uploads)

8. Transaction Failures and Fund Loss (Svansy's concerns about losing life savings, tokens disappearing)

9. Russian Rubles and Asset Exchange (user_716... asking about exchanging Rubles for OSMO)

10. Technical Discussions on GRPC and WebUI (commands and tools like grpcui, issues with WebUIs)

Wait, some of these might overlap. For example, IBC relaying is part of the Cosmos ecosystem tools. Also, the part about checking transaction history and authz access by JohnnyWyles87 relates to security or maybe

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from a group related to Osmosis and other blockchain stuff. I need to go through each message and determine the overall sentiment.

First, looking at the messages from BasementNodes and Svansy. They mention issues with nodes, relayers, and configurations. Phrases like "shit is so confusing," "can't even remember the way to check," and "forcing everything through my webserver" indicate frustration. Those are negative sentiments. 

Then there's a user asking about buying OSMO with Russian rubles. BasementNodes and others respond that it's not possible, which might be neutral but the context of difficulty could lean negative. 

Some messages are about technical solutions, like using grpcurl or sharing configs. These are more neutral or positive since they're problem-solving. However, BasementNodes says "I hate making these configs," which is negative. 

Svansy talks about losing life savings and needing to short everything, which is definitely negative. The mention of Rugchecker and possible rug pulls shows concern, but the user also says "great tools exist already," which is positive. 

There's a proposal discussion about whitelisting addresses. The tone here seems neutral, discussing technical aspects without clear positive or negative words. 

Other parts have sarcasm like "these teams need to get real tbh" and "if you can't even run a node..." which are negative. 

Positive sentiments are from sascha1337 who appreciates a tool and mentions "great stuff" about Andromeda. Deploydon and others seem excited about proposals, which is positive. 

But overall, the negative comments about technical issues, frustration, and financial losses seem to outweigh the positive. Neutral parts are when sharing links or technical details without clear emotion. 

I need to check if there's a balance. The user is asking for the overall sentiment. Let me count: more negative messages than positive. Neutral ones are the technical exchanges without strong emotion. So the final sentiment is negative, with some positive notes but mostly frustration and problems.

The sentiment of this text is **negative**, with pockets of **neutral** and **positive** elements. Here's a breakdown:

### **Negative** (Dominant Theme):
- **Frustration with technical issues**:  
  BasementNodes expresses repeated frustration ("shit is so confusing," "I hate making these configs," "

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's anything actionable.

Starting from the top, osmosis_statbot provides a support link. That's more of a reference, not an action item. Then Svansy comments about devs not knowing about nodes. That's an opinion, not an action. 

BasementNodes mentions supporting relaying in the eco, but it's a statement, not a task. Another message from BasementNodes talks about needing to run a node or support relayers. Maybe that's a decision point? They're emphasizing the necessity of nodes for relayers, so perhaps a decision to prioritize node setup or support. 

Looking at the messages about relayer configurations: BasementNodes says they hate making configs and that their methods are failing. sascha1337 provides a command using grpcui. Maybe the action item here is to use that command or simplify relayer configurations. Also, there's a mention of a helper script and a config example. So next steps could involve implementing or testing that command.

Svansy and BasementNodes discuss IBC transfers and losing funds. Svansy is worried about their life savings, which is concerning but not an action item. They mention checking a rug checker site, so maybe a next step is to verify token safety using that tool.

There's a proposal to clean up the CWPool whitelist and another to whitelist Deploydon's address. These are governance proposals, so decisions might be to vote on them or monitor their status. Deploydon's request to be welcomed could be a reminder to approve the address.

User_7164487109 from Russia asks about buying OSMO with rubles. BasementNodes and Svansy suggest alternatives like SquidRouter. So next steps for the user might be to use those methods, but as an action item for the team, maybe they need to explore fiat onramps.

JohnnyWyles87 talks about checking addresses and transaction history. Maybe an action item is to streamline this process or use better tools.

Sascha1337 mentions using Rust tonic for GRPC data and a cronjob llama agent for alerts. That's more about their own setup than an action item for others.

Svansy suggests building a rug checker for Cosmos, so a
