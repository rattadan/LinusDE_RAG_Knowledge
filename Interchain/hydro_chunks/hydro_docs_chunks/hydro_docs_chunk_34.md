**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

The formula to calculate a maximum allocation using the tribute floor is:

Max allocation = current_tribute_amount / tribute_floor_rate

The table below shows two examples of how the rate of the tribute floor can impact the maximum amount of liquidity a bid can receive. As bidders increase their tribute (or ATOM price fluctuates), the maximum allocation is updated dynamically throughout a bidding round. The system will enforce it at the end of the round, before the deployment is made. A healthy tribute floor rate ensures fair contributions for liquidity and healthy APRs for users. ## Bids without live tokens
------------------------

Some projects may not have a live token with which to bid. In that case, the simplest option is to upload a tribute with another token (e.g., ATOM, USDC, etc.). No technical work is required; the project simply submits the tribute using the token it wishes to pay. However, some bidders do not have a live token yet and instead wish to use points as tribute.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

1. The formula to calculate a maximum allocation using the tribute floor is Max allocation = current_tribute_amount / tribute_floor_rate.
2. The tribute floor rate impacts the maximum amount of liquidity a bid can receive.
3. The system enforces maximum allocation at the end of a round, before the deployment is made.
4. Bidders can use alternative tokens (e.g., ATOM, USDC) instead of live tokens to pay tribute.
5. Projects can submit tribute using points as an alternative to tokens, requiring no technical work.

**Connection to Surrounding Context:**

The current text chunk builds upon the previous sections by providing a specific formula and process for calculating and enforcing the maximum allocation based on the tribute floor rate. This process is part of the broader Hydro platform, which aims to manage the Cosmos Hub's liquidity and provide value for ATOM holders.

**Requirements, Conditions, and Constraints:**

1. The system enforces maximum allocation at the end of a round, before the deployment is made.
2. A healthy tribute floor rate is required to ensure fair contributions for liquidity and healthy APRs for users.
3. Bidders must submit tribute using tokens or points, and must meet the hydrogen committee's guidelines for bid submission.
4. At least two tokens (ATOM and USDC) are mentioned as acceptable alternatives for tribute payment.

The analysis of the current text chunk and its context reveals that it provides a formula and process for calculating and enforcing maximum allocation based on tribute floor rate, which is part of the broader Hydro platform's process for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity and providing value for ATOM holders. The requirements, conditions, and constraints mentioned in the text chunk include enforcing maximum allocation at the end of a round, requiring a healthy tribute floor rate, and using tokens or points as acceptable tribute payment alternatives.
