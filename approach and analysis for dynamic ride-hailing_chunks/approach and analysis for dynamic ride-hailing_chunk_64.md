**Original Text:**

Since, especially in settings with high
demand, long repositioning jobs are often not finished but aborted
to serve a new customer request, we only consider the parking lots
within a certain radius of the vehicle’s location. • In regular intervals, the whole fleet needs to be repositioned. Unfortunately, due to the overlapping of the lot zones as well
as the non-linear reward function for sending vehicles to specific
lots, we cannot use a simple linear matching approach. Instead,
we implemented an iterative, greedy approach. In each iteration, the profit for every vehicle-lot-combination is checked for
the maximum profit. The lot with the highest profit is selected. The supply for this lot, as well as for all lots in proximity, is
increased and the undersupply probabilities are updated. Lots can
be selected multiple times. After each iteration, a cost-minimum
matching problem is solved to determine which of the available
vehicles will be repositioned to which lot.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The chunk describes an iterative, greedy approach for dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems.
* The approach involves calculating the profit of each vehicle-lot combination and selecting the most profitable lot.
* The algorithm also updates the supply and undersupply probabilities for selected lots.
* A cost-minimum matching problem is used to determine which vehicles will be repositioned.

**Context Connection:**

The chunk connects to its surrounding context by providing a detailed explanation of the dynamic dispatch process in ride-hailing systems, specifically:

* The importance of high demand, long repositioning jobs, and their impact on vehicle allocation.
* The challenge of overlapping lot zones and non-linear reward functions that prevent simple linear matching approaches.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The chunk requires:

* High demand to justify the need for dynamic dispatch and repositioning.
* Long repositioning jobs that require frequent updates to allocate vehicles efficiently.
* Overlapping lot zones and non-linear reward functions that make a simple linear approach infeasible.
* A cost-minimum matching problem to ensure efficient allocation of vehicles.

Overall, this chunk provides a detailed technical explanation of the dynamic dispatch process in ride-hailing systems, highlighting its complexities and challenges.
