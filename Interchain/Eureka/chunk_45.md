## Chunk 45

**Original Text:**

The token can be transferred back there, but it can't be used or swapped for anything in the same transaction. In principle, you can use the Skip Go API to construct any of these action sequences across multiple transactions, but it will be more challenging for you and your end users.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're asking about using the SkipGo API to construct action sequences across multiple transactions, but with a limitation on using them for swapping tokens.

To provide more value, could you please clarify or rephrase the question? Are you looking for guidance on how to:

1. Use the SkipGo API to construct different actions in separate transactions?
2. Ensure that token swaps are allowed and don't violate any rules or limitations?
3. Improve the overall user experience by providing better feedback or guidance?

Additionally, joining the Discord community as a "Skip Go Developer" role seems like an exciting opportunity! If you're not already familiar with the platform, I'd be happy to help you explore its features and capabilities.
