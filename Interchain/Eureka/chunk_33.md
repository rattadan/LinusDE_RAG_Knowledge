Background
​
What is a CW20 token? CW20 is the fungible token spec for the CosmWasm (i.e. CW) VM. CosmWasm is the most popular smart contract VM among CosmosSDK blockchains today. At a high-level, CW20 is very similar to ERC20 (the popular EVM fungible token standard).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

A CW20 token is a type of fungible token designed for use on the Cosmos SDK-based blockchain platform Terra2. It's essentially a copycat version of the popular ERC-20 token standard, optimized for use cases tailored to the CosmWasm (CW) virtual machine. Fungible tokens are a form of digital asset that can be bought, sold, and traded like physical commodities.
