**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of the text chunk appears to be describing technical details and parameters related to shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) simulation models.

Here's a breakdown of what is being explained:

1. **Technical details**: The authors mention integrating supply and demand perspectives for large-scale simulations, which implies that they are discussing the mathematical or computational aspects of SAV modeling.
2. **Parameters and processes**: They also discuss specific parameters such as dynamic ride-sharing preferences, privacy considerations, and long-distance mode choices, which suggests that they are providing a detailed analysis of the complex interactions involved in SAV operations.
3. **Contextual connection**: The surrounding context is provided, highlighting the importance of SAV simulation models in understanding their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer behavior, and operational strategies.

Specifically, this chunk appears to be building upon the concept of shared autonomous vehicle simulations by introducing new parameters and processes that are relevant to these studies. By discussing integrating supply and demand perspectives, dynamic ride-sharing preferences, etc., the authors are expanding the scope of SAV modeling and its application in various urban transportation contexts.

As for specific requirements or conditions mentioned:

* The text mentions a timeframe spanning from 2014 to 2020, implying that the authors consulted relevant literature during this period.
* Key authors include K.M. Kockelman and J.W. Ward, which suggests that they are referencing influential researchers in the field of SAV modeling.
* The references provided (e.g., Kumar et al. 2020) may be requiring specific formatting or citation style.
