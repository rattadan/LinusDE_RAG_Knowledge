## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I need to parse each tweet. The first three tweets are all about the Cosmos Weekly News. Each has a part number (1/, 2/) and mentions showing support with RT (retweets). They also list various cryptocurrency tickers like $ATOM, $EVMOS, etc. The second tweet includes a link to Crew3 and mentions roles like CosmosRanger, Youngling, etc., and a campaign with tags like #Giveaways and #Airdrops. The last tweet is a retweet about a podcast episode discussing economic topics.

Key points here are the weekly news updates, the Crew3 campaign for community engagement with role-playing elements, and the Citizen Cosmos podcast episode. The decisions might be the initiatives they're promoting: encouraging retweets, participation in Crew3, and listening to the podcast.

I should make sure to mention the dates, but since the summary is supposed to be concise, maybe omit the exact timestamps unless they're relevant. The main focus is on the campaigns and content they're spreading. Also, note the hashtags and the tokens mentioned as part of the key points.

Need to structure the summary to highlight each main initiative: Weekly News, Crew3 campaign with roles, and the podcast. Use bullet points or sections. Avoid redundancy since the first three tweets are similar. Combine the parts of the weekly news into one point. Mention the tokens and the purpose of each campaign. Also, the RT request is a decision point to spread the word.

Check if there's any other important info. The links are probably not necessary unless they're critical, but the user wants a concise summary. So focus on the actions they're promoting and the key topics. Make sure to note the role-playing aspect in Crew3 and the podcast guest and topics briefly.

Alright, putting it all together. Start with the weekly news, then the Crew3 campaign with the roles and the associated activities, then the podcast episode. Mention the tokens and the hashtags as part of the key elements. Highlight the call to action for retweets and participation.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to understand the structure of the input. It looks like a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, each with some hashtags and mentions.

Starting with the first tweet, the user mentions "Cosmos Weekly News" and includes symbols like $EVMOS, $SWTH, $XPRT, $INJ. These are cryptocurrency tickers, so they might be topics. Then there's a second tweet with "Cosmos Weekly News" again and more tickers: $ATOM, $TORI, $EVMOS, $MNTL, $STA... Maybe $STA is another token, but it's cut off. The third tweet is similar, repeating the weekly news and some of the same tickers. The fourth tweet talks about joining the Cosmos Ecosystem crew, mentions roles like CosmosRanger, Youngling, etc., and includes hashtags like #Hero, #Crew3, #roles, #xp. The last tweet refers to a podcast episode, #citizencosmos, with topics related to economic Phi (possibly from phi_labs mentioned in the tweet).

So, the main topics here seem to revolve around the Cosmos Ecosystem, their weekly news, various cryptocurrency projects/tokens (ATOM, EVMOS, SWTH, XPRT, INJ, TORI, MNTL, STARS, JUNO, OSMO), the Crew3 initiative, roles within it (CosmosRanger, Youngling, Padawan, Jedi), and the Citizen Cosmos podcast discussing economic aspects. Also, hashtags like #Giveaways, #Airdrops, #Crypto are mentioned. I should compile all these into a list, ensuring no duplicates. Need to check if $STA is a complete ticker or part of another; since it's followed by an ellipsis, maybe it's $STA. Also, note that some terms are repeated across tweets, like $EVMOS and $ATOM. The podcast topic mentions Economic Phi, which might be a specific topic name. Should I include the hashtags as topics? The user said "main topics," so probably yes. Also, the Crew3 and the roles associated with it are part of the topics. The links and mentions like @CosmosEcosystem or URLs can be ignored as they are not topics

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. I need to determine if each is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, looking at the tweets, they all seem to be promoting Cosmos projects. The language used includes emojis like üöÄ, üî•, üó£Ô∏è, which are often positive. Words like "support," "spreading the word," "join," "learn," "upgrade," "get roles," and "become Jedi" are encouraging and enthusiastic. 

The first tweet mentions "Show your support with RT" and uses fire and speaking emojis. That's definitely positive. The second one starts with "We keep spreading the word!" which is proactive and positive. The third tweet talks about joining Crew3, learning, upgrading skills, and becoming different roles, which sounds motivational. The fourth tweet is a retweet of a podcast episode, which is more neutral, but the topics are about economic aspects, so maybe neutral unless there's a positive spin. However, since it's a retweet from another account, the sentiment might depend on the original content. But the act of retweeting a podcast without negative comments would likely be neutral or positive. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to analyze each text, but the example response combines them. Maybe the user wants an overall sentiment for all the texts together. Let me check the example again. The example response lists each text's sentiment and then the overall. So I should do the same.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first one: Emojis like üî•, üó£Ô∏è, and phrases like "Show your support," "keep spreading the word" are positive. So positive.
2. Second tweet similar to the first, same structure. Positive.
3. Third tweet same as the first two. Positive.
4. Fourth tweet is a retweet of a podcast. The original tweet from cosmos_voice might have its own sentiment, but the retweet itself is just sharing information. The topics are economic, which is neutral. So the retweet without additional commentary is neutral.
5. Fifth tweet is another retweet with similar structure to the first three, so positive.

Wait, the user's input has five entries. Let me recount:

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text consists of several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. 

First, I need to go through each tweet and see if there are any explicit actions mentioned. Action items usually involve tasks someone needs to do, like "join", "learn", "upgrade", "get roles", etc. Decisions might be if they mention choosing something, and next steps could be things like participating in events or following links.

Looking at the first three tweets, they're all about the Cosmos Weekly News. They mention showing support with RT (retweet), which is an action item. The users are encouraged to retweet to spread the word. Then there's a tweet that says "Join Cosmos Ecosystem #Crew3, learn new things, upgrade your skills, get #xp! Get #roles..." So here, the actions are joining Crew3, learning, upgrading skills, getting XP and roles. The links provided are probably for joining, so including those as next steps makes sense.

Another tweet mentions a podcast episode with topics like Economic Phi... but it's a retweet from another user. The main action here is listening to the podcast. However, since it's a retweet, maybe the action is for the audience to check it out. But the original decision to retweet might be from the Cosmos Ecosystem team, so that's a decision they made.

I should also check for any other tasks like participating in giveaways or airdrops mentioned in the hashtags. The last tweet in the series includes #Giveaways and #Airdrops, so maybe the action item is to participate in those. But the tweet doesn't explicitly say how, so maybe just noting those as topics rather than specific actions.

Wait, the user might be part of a group chat where these tweets are shared, and the assistant needs to list what the group should do. But the tweets are from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, so the action items are what they're promoting. So the extracted items would be the actions the audience is encouraged to take by the tweets.

So compiling all these, the main points are retweeting their posts, joining Crew3, learning/upgrading skills, getting roles and XP, listening to the podcast, and checking out the links provided. Each of these should be listed as action items with the corresponding URLs. Decisions might include the
