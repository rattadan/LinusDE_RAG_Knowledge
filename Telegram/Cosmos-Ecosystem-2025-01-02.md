## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different users discussing various crypto topics, mainly around Cosmos ecosystem, some tokens, and security practices.

First, I need to identify the main topics. There's a lot about seed phrases and security, especially from BasementNodes and Arcmosis. The key point there is that the only solution to security is not writing down the seed phrase. Then, there's discussion about $HYPE token's growth compared to USDT and UST, with Arcmosis mentioning it's a disruptor and leading to becoming a target. 

Next, there are mentions of Cosmos Ecosystem NFTs and incentives for contributors. The users tagged like @Asa332, @vokrep, etc., are getting funds from the minted NFTs. Also, some price data from CoinhallBot for AKT, ATOM, and others. 

Other points include discussions about LSM and AuthZ grants on Ledger, risks associated with them, and some personal comments about fitness and memes. There's also a mention of IRS delaying crypto tax reporting until 2026. 

I should filter out the less important parts like the jokes, personal comments, and spam. Focus on the security advice, token dynamics ($HYPE, ATOM, AKT), NFT incentives, and the IRS news. Also, note the risks of using certain wallets and the advice to avoid writing down seed phrases. 

Need to structure this clearly, maybe in bullet points, separating different topics: Security, Token Updates, Ecosystem News, and Other Notes. Make sure to highlight decisions like not writing seed phrases, the NFT incentive distribution, and the IRS delay. Avoid including the random banter unless it's relevant. Check for any other important decisions or data points like price changes or market caps. Also, note the potential risks with LSM and AuthZ grants leading to vulnerabilities. 

Wait, there's a part where Arcmosis says holding ATOM is risky because of LSM and AuthZ adoption. That's a key point. Also, the Cosmos Ecosystem News NFTs are starting to trade, which is an event. The HYPE token's volume comparison to Binance and the prediction to sell at $100. 

Make sure to mention the contributors being incentivized from the NFT funds. And the IRS delay on

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or subjects.

Looking at the messages, there's a lot of discussion about cryptocurrency projects like Cosmos (ATOM), HYPE, USDT, UST, AKT, and others. Terms like "dex perp volume," "LSM phishing," and "ledger security" come up, which relate to crypto trading and security. There's mention of NFTs on the Cosmos ecosystem, specifically Stargaze zone, and incentives for contributors. 

Some users talk about market predictions, like HYPE being the new LUNA, which is a reference to previous crypto cycles. There's also discussion about airdrops, both in terms of claiming them and asking about future ones. Technical aspects like seed phrases, AuthZ grants, and potential bugs in systems like LSM are mentioned, indicating security concerns. 

Other topics include price checks using CoinhallBot, mentions of Telegram bots and their issues, fitness discussions (though that seems off-topic), and some meme references. The IRS delaying crypto tax reporting is another point. Also, there's a mention of a token launch on Hypurr.fun and issues with the bot during the launch.

Putting this all together, the main topics would be: Cosmos ecosystem, cryptocurrency trading (specifically HYPE, ATOM, AKT, USDT), NFTs on Stargaze, airdrops, ledger/seed phrase security, LSM and AuthZ vulnerabilities, market predictions, IRS crypto tax delays, token launches, Telegram bot interactions, and maybe some meme culture. I should list these without repeating and in a concise manner.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from a Telegram group related to Cosmos and other crypto projects. I need to go through each message and determine the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the conversation. There's a lot here, so maybe I can categorize them. Let's see:

- There's discussion about seed phrases and security, like "only solution is to never write the seed phrase down" and concerns about Ledger security. These might be neutral or slightly negative since they're about risks.
- Mentions of HYPE token's performance, such as "max long from $34 on 3x leverage" and "bullish news only for the next week." These seem positive, but some might be negative if they're critical.
- References to past events like Luna collapse and UST FUD, which are negative. For example, "after luna now mars üòÇ" is probably negative.
- Price updates from CoinhallBot are neutral as they're factual.
- Some messages are jokes or memes, like "limp dick pump" which is negative towards ATOM.
- There's a lot of technical discussion about blockchain vulnerabilities, which could be negative or neutral depending on context.
- Happy New Year greetings are positive.
- Incentives and contributions to the Cosmos ecosystem are positive.
- Some messages are about banning users or kicking them, which might be negative but not directly related to sentiment about the crypto projects.

Now, looking for key sentiments:

Positive: Messages celebrating contributions, New Year greetings, some price pumps (like AKT's +20.51% 24h), and incentives for the ecosystem.

Negative: Criticisms of tokens as "shitcoins," mentions of scams, security risks, "limp dick pump" for ATOM, and references to past failures like Luna.

Neutral: Price data from bots, technical discussions without clear positive/negative slant, and some procedural messages.

I need to check if the negative messages are more prevalent. There's a lot of talk about risks, scams, and past failures. However, there are also positive elements like celebrating contributions and some price gains. The user's initial message about seed phrases being risky might be a negative, but others are discussing security measures neutrally.

The mention of "HYPE is almost already 40%

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll need to go through each message carefully and identify any explicit tasks, commitments, or plans mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first message by BasementNodes says, "only solution is to never write the seed phrase down." That sounds like a decision or a recommendation regarding security practices. So that's a possible action item.

Then, Arcmosis mentions USDT being disrupted by UST and HYPE being 40% of dex perp volume but still 1/10th of Binance. This seems more like an observation rather than an action item. The next message from lostreply asks, "What is it disrupting," which is a question, not an action.

Arcmosis again talks about Binance's USG trouble and USDT FUD, but that's analysis. The message "shhhh don't gnotice this" might be a joke or a meme reference, not a clear action. Cosmotick's "No bro on this cicle after luna now mars" is a comment, maybe a meme reference again, not a task.

Arcmosis states, "By My Hands DAI will DIE," which is a bold statement but not an actionable item. The message about similarity leading to becoming a target is a thought, not a step. "Probably sell at 100$" could be a personal decision, so that's a possible next step.

Cosmotick's message about not caring who is told is a declaration, not an action. "Wtf my love akt üöÄ" is an expression of sentiment. The CoinhallBot messages provide price data, which are informational, not actions.

The example usage instructions from CoinhallBot are about how to use commands, which might be considered as steps but are more like guidelines. Cosmotick's "Not remember sorry" and Al_FagheZ asking for a tweet link are about retrieving information but not actions to be taken.

The unknown user mentions incentives for Cosmos contributors, tagging several people and asking them to retweet and DM with their addresses. That's a clear action item: contributors need to retweet and send their Stargaze addresses. 

Cosmotick's "Atom need this" and "Make ‚öõÔ∏è meme" are requests, so those could be next steps for others. The
