### Document Overview  
This content outlines staking features of Avalanche, emphasizing no slashing, low hardware requirements, and staking rewards with APY calculations.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **No Slashing**: Tokens on Avalanche are never at risk of slashing, ensuring security and stability.  
- **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**: Rewards for staked AVAX, with rates of 7.65% (max) and 7.96% (daily).  
- **Staking Calculator**: Tools to calculate rewards based on stake size, time horizon, and fee parameters.  
- **Low Hardware Requirements**: Minimal equipment needed for staking, making it accessible.  
- **Delegation Fees**: Users can set their own fees for accepting delegations to their node.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Staking Calculator Parameters**:  
  - **Daily APY**: 7.96% (e.g., $0.32 per day).  
  - **Monthly APY**: 7.96% (e.g., $11.37 per month).  
  - **Yearly APY**: 8.58% (e.g., $137.45 per year).  
- **Fee Structure**: Users can customize fees for delegating to nodes, influencing reward rates.  
- **Hardware Requirements**: No specialized equipment; minimal hardware is sufficient.  

### Related Topics
