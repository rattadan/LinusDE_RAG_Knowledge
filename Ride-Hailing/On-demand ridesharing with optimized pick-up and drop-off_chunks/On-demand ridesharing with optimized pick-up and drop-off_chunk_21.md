**Original Text:**

Contribution
The main contributions of this paper are threefold: Firstly, we theoretically analyze the advantages and potential of optimizing the
PUDO points in a ridesharing system, and we formulate the associated optimization problem, showing that it contains two subproblems that extend set cover. Secondly, we propose a methodology able to solve this relevant problem over large instances and
run simulations over a real-life study case, showing that the proposed method leads to relevant improvements over the original system
without walking. Finally, we analyze how the quality of service changes in space to understand these emerging SMoD systems better. 4

2.1. The optimization problem
Consider a strongly connected digraph3 G = (ùí±, E). Each arc e has two positive functions tV (e) and tW (e), representing the time
required to cross it over a vehicle and walking, respectively.
