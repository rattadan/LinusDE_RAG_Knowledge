# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_3.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.base.org/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses Base's commitment to an open-source, globally accessible on-chain platform, focusing on protocols, applications, and partnerships to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital economy growth.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **On-chain Platform**: The foundational layer for decentralized applications (DApps) and financial systems.  
- **Open Source**: The platform is free to use and accessible globally.  
- **L2 Rollups (EIP4844)**: Scalable layer-2 solutions (e.g., Optimism) to enhance transaction throughput.  
- **USDC (USD Coin)**: A stablecoin bridging traditional finance with blockchain.  
- **cbETH**: A tokenized version of Ethereum, enabling decentralized finance and rewards.  
- **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**: Applications built on the on-chain platform for financial, identity, and data management.  
- **EIP4844**: A proposal to standardize layer-2 rollups on Ethereum.  

### Implementation Details  
- **EIP4844 with Optimism**: Base’s implementation of layer-2 rollups to scale Ethereum’s transactions.  
- **Open Source**: Base’s platform is open-source, allowing developers to build and customize DApps.  
- **USDC and cbETH**: Examples of on-chain applications enabling stablecoin transactions and rewards.  
- **Wallet Integrations**: Partnerships with Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, and others to simplify user adoption.  
- **Global Accessibility**: The platform aims to be accessible worldwide, with focus on low fees and high security.  

### Related Topics  
- **Protocols**: The document connects to Base’s focus on foundational protocols (e.g., EIP4844) to enable scalable DeFi.  
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: The content emphasizes applications like USDC, cbETH, and DApps for financial systems.  
- **Open Source Ecosystem**: Base’s commitment to open-source aligns with broader blockchain documentation on developer tools and standards.

around each protocol and early adopters began experimenting with how they could be used.

Coinbase started here. Investment or speculation is a bootstrapping mechanism for a payment network (in other words, it is thesingle-player modeof digital currency). And the creation of safe and easy to use exchanges served as abridgefor people to get their local currency into and out of digital currency.

To move beyond just exchange and investment, consumers and businesses needed an easy interface to start using digital currency and its applications. Countless applications have been built to let anyone, anywhere access the nascent cryptoeconomy, including Coinbase, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, and others.

With the interfaces in place, our existing financial system now needs to be recreated on open networks and made globally accessible. Were seeing this happen in front of our eyes: USDC has brought billions of dollars onchain, cbETH enables holders anywhere to secure the financial system while earning rewards, and hundreds of onchain apps are enabling countless individuals and institutions to transact with lower fees, more security, and unparalleled access.

We've had countless conversations about how we can accelerate Phase 4 of this plan with both internal teams and external collaborators. The takeaway is that in order to unlock the scale, usability, and security needed for the final phase, we actually need to go back to the beginning: developing the underlying protocols that enable the end user applications.

We started by doing this on Ethereum, drivingEIP4844with Optimism to enable L2 rollups to scale.But we don't believe that's enough, so here we are.

Base is our all in commitment to onchain.

We believe that the onchain platform is the most important builder platform since the internet (online). We believe that the onchain platform should be open source, free to use, and globally available.
