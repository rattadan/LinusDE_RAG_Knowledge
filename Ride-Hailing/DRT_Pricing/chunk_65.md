## Chunk 65

**Original Text:**

In contrast, a larger DRT service area increases the modal shift from
car to DRT. The setup in which DRT vehicles operate inside the entire Berlin area, a higher minimum fee translates
into a higher share of users switching from car to DRT. Nevertheless, the share of users switching from car to DRT is
rather minor compared to the number of users switching from PT to DRT. (a) Minimum fee: 0.00 EUR
No car toll
DRT trips: 255,030

(b) Minimum fee: 2.00 EUR
No car toll
DRT trips: 28,680

(c) Minimum fee: 3.00 EUR
No car toll
DRT trips: 3,770

(d) Minimum fee: 3.00 EUR
With car toll
DRT trips: 6,560

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The correct answer is (d) Minimum fee: 3.00 EUR with car toll.

This is because as the minimum fee increases from $0 to $2 to $3, the proportion of users switching from a private taxi (PT) to the DRT service area decreases. This indicates that increasing the minimum fee makes it more cost-effective for people to switch to using the DRT service area instead of taking a car.

In contrast, as the minimum fee increases from $0 to $2 to $3, the proportion of users switching from a private taxi (PT) to not using the DRT service area remains relatively small compared to those switching from public transport (PT) to the DRT service area.
