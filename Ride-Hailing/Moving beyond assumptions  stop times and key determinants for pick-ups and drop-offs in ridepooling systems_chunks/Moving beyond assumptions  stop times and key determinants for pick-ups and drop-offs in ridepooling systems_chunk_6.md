**Original Text:**

Unlike traditional PT stations, DRT services leverage pre-defined pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) points, commonly referred to as
virtual stops (Kucharski and Cats 2024). These virtual stops can be situated anywhere along
the roadside, distinguishing them from traditional PT infrastructure (Harmann, YilmazNiewerth, and Jacob 2022). Furthermore, the use of smaller vehicles in DRT services, as
opposed to standard PT vehicles like buses or trams, introduces differences in aspects such
as entry areas and the volume of passengers dwelling at stops. In general, DRT services offer several advantages in terms of sustainability, flexibility,
and efficiency (Shaheen 2018). Ridepooling systems merge and combine different passenger requests into a single vehicle, resulting in a significant reduction in vehicle kilometers
traveled and, consequently, the potential to decrease motorised traffic and improve traffic
dynamics in cities (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017; Tirachini et al. 2020; Zwick et al. 2020).
