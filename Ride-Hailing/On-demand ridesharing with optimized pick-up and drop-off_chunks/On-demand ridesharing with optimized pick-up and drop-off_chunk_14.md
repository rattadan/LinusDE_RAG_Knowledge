**Original Text:**

Another one is Uber’s “Express pool” that operates in some American cities, in which passengers are told to
walk to some pick-up points different from their origins. Finally, it is worth explaining that both users and operators might benefit from this alternative. Operators’ efficiency is directly
improved when following shorter routes that diminish the required average driving time/distance to serve each passenger. On the
other hand, users seem to be negatively affected because walking is less comfortable than waiting at home (or whatever the origin is). However, this can be compensated by lower waiting and in-vehicle times (as we show in our simulations), and even if that is not the
case, operators’ gains can be shared with users employing reduced fares. Moreover, SMoD systems might be integrated into transit
networks (as suggested by Luo and Nie, 2019; Fielbaum, 2020), where passengers are already used to walk.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the concept of "Express Pool" or a similar ride-sharing service that Uber has implemented in some American cities, which encourages users to take shorter routes to pick up other riders.

### Exact Technical Details:

- **Methodology**: The Express Pool relies on advanced routing algorithms and optimization techniques to reduce travel times for both passengers and operators.
- **Simulation Techniques**: The section mentions simulations to demonstrate how the Express Pool can improve efficiency and user satisfaction, showing that while users might be negatively affected by walking (less comfortable), their overall waiting and in-vehicle times are reduced.

### Parameters or Processes:

- **Travel Times**: The travel times for both passengers and operators are optimized using advanced routing algorithms and simulation techniques.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The Express Pool aims to improve operational efficiency, particularly for the operator's side, by following shorter routes that reduce average driving time and distance traveled per passenger.

### Connection to or Building upon the Surrounding Context:

This section connects directly to the surrounding context of ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems by explaining how Uber's "Express Pool" addresses challenges in this area. The concept is presented as a solution for reducing travel times and improving efficiency, aligning with broader themes such as rebalancing strategies, modeling and mathematical frameworks, and optimization heuristics.

### Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:

- **Operational Context**: The Express Pool operates in specific American cities, indicating that the solution requires tailored implementation to these locations.
- **User Experience**: Users are negatively affected by walking, implying that a solution is needed that balances user convenience with operational efficiency.
