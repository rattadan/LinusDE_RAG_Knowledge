### Document Overview  
The content discusses crypto market dynamics, focusing on bull and bear markets, technical analysis metrics, and infrastructure details like energy contributions from anodes.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Bull and Bear Markets**: Contrasting phases of crypto markets, with bulls driving price increases and bears causing declines.  
- **Technical Analysis Metrics**: Indicators like a 20% price drop as a bull market threshold, though cryptocurrencies may fall more in bear markets.  
- **Animal Metaphors**: Use of "fighting stance" for both bull and bear markets, with bears symbolizing downward price movements.  
- **Market Corrections**: Sudden price drops triggered by economic data, geopolitical events, or investor panic.  
- **Transaction Flows**: Monitoring cryptocurrency movements to assess investor behavior (e.g., withdrawals to private wallets vs. deposits on exchanges).  
- **Energy Contributions**: Anodes (computers) supporting blockchain validation, highlighting infrastructure efficiency.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Market Metrics**: Examples include the global crypto market falling from $3 trillion to $1 trillion between 2021 and 2022.  
- **Technical Analysis**: A 20% price drop as a threshold for defining a bull market, though cryptocurrencies may exhibit larger declines in bear markets.  
- **Infrastructure Details**: Mention of anodes (computers) contributing energy to blockchain validation, emphasizing network efficiency.  

### Related Topics  
- **Technical Analysis**: Connection to metrics and indicators used in market forecasting.  
- **Market Trends**: Link to monitoring cryptocurrency flows and investor behavior.  
- **Blockchain Infrastructure**: Reference to anodes and energy contributions, tying to broader blockchain technical documentation.

transactions, growing cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and more computers (akanodes) contributing energy to a blockchainâs validation process. On-chain analysts also monitor the flows of cryptocurrencies to and from exchanges, which gives a glimpse into whether more people are withdrawing cryptocurrency into private wallets or depositing on exchanges to potentially sell their digital assets.Â

Sometimes, the start of a bull market catches traders by surprise. Itâs tricky to know a bull run is happening without the benefit of hindsight. However, there are a few metrics traders use to determine whether the crypto market is leaning bullish:Â

The only similarity between a "bear market" and a "bull market" is that both terms use an animal's fighting stance as their defining metaphor. Unlike bulls, bears tend to attack their prey with a downward motion, symbolizing the falling market prices during a âbear market.âÂ

In a bear market, sellers outpace buyers as more people rush tocash out their Bitcoinand altcoins. Bad economic data or geopolitical issues such as war, high unemployment rates, or poor GDP numbers often trigger a market downturn and lead to a bear market. Understandably, traders tend to feel pessimistic and fearful about the future while going through a market correction. In terms of technical analysis, many economists define a bull market as a drop of at least 20% in the broader market, but due to their volatility, cryptocurrencies may fall more than 20% in a bear period. For instance, the global crypto market fell from a peak of$3 trillionto less than $1 trillion between the 2021 bull run and the 2022 bear market. If the prices of digital assets stay low and stagnant for a long time, traders may say they're in a "crypto winter."Â

Unlike a short-lived and unsustainable price spike (a âbubbleâ), a bull market is a sustained period of economic growth.
