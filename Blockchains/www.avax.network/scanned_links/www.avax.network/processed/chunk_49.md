Web3 builders. The cohort brought a broad range of product ideas to Codebase that included everything from B2B SaaS and loyalty marketplaces for food and beverage to decentralized AI and stablecoin platforms.Â

Although the founders and products in Cohort 2 were eclectic, they all had important elements in common that helped crystalize the elements of a strong application to the Codebase program. First and foremost, all of the Cohort 2 teams were able to clearly articulate why their idea needed to be on Avalancheâs blockchain, which meant understanding the unique business models, go-to-market strategies, or product features that are unlocked by its ecosystem.Â

Another important characteristic of all the Cohort 2 members was the strength of their team and the relationships between team members. Strong interpersonal relationships on each team helped mitigate founder drama that can unravel even the best startup idea and each startup was composed of team members with unique and mutually reinforcing skill sets that increase their odds of successfully developing a product.Â

But perhaps most importantly was the teamâs relationship with potential customers. Too often, says Martin, founders donât have a good sense of who, exactly, will be buying their product. They might have a general sense of the industry or type of company that would buy it, but canât identify the person within that company who theyâd be selling to. Even if they can identify the specific customer profile, itâs equally important that they have existing relationships with that type of person.Â

âAt this stage, itâs less about having a complete understanding of your customer than having a direct path to them,â says Martin. âFounders need to be able to talk to and interview the people who would be their potential customer.
