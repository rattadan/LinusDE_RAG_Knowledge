**Original Text:**

This is below the threshold of 10, indicative of multicollinearity issues (Oâ€™brien 2007), confirming the distinct contribution of each variable to
our models. The pseudo R2 values are comparable, with 0.69 for the boarding model and 0.67 for
the alighting model. A notable disparity exists in the intercept values, with a difference of
approximately 41 s. In the boarding model, the variable xWait demonstrates high statistical significance, with
a substantial coefficient exceeding 154 s. This finding underscores the critical influence of
passenger punctuality; passengers arriving late significantly extend the overall stop time
at PUDO locations. In addition, pick-up stop times are extended by the need to store
larger baggage (xBag ), which has been found to be statistically significant. The variable xVir
shows moderate significance and has a negative impact on pick-up stop times, indicating
that stops at PT bus stations last longer compared to those at virtual stops.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk appears to be discussing the relationship between passenger punctuality and ride-pooling system efficiency, specifically within the context of urban transport systems.

### Technical Details:

- **Pseudo R2 values**: 0.69 for the boarding model and 0.67 for the alighting model. These statistics indicate how well the model fits the data.
- **Intercept differences**: Approximately 41 seconds differ between the intercept values for passengers arriving late (xWait) and those arriving on time (xPunct). The difference in the intercept of pick-up stop times (xBag) is also around 41 seconds.

### Connection to or Building upon the Surrounding Context:

- **Urban Transport Systems**: This context establishes the urban transport system as a key area of focus, where ride-pooling services are being studied for efficiency and sustainability.
- **Simulation Studies**: The mention of simulation tools like MATSim further connects this text chunk to the broader research theme, indicating an interest in modeling and optimizing ride-pooling systems using advanced technologies.
- **Sustainability Impacts**: The discussion of sustainable impacts, such as reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion, highlights the importance of incorporating sustainability considerations into ride-pooling system design.

### Specific Requirements or Constraints:

- **Multicollinearity Issues**: O'Brien (2007) notes that multicollinearity can be a problem when using multiple variables in modeling. This text chunk is below the threshold of 10 s, indicating potential issues with multicollinearity due to the complex relationships between the variables mentioned.

### Analysis:

- The relationship between passenger punctuality and ride-pooling system efficiency is a critical aspect of this research theme.
- The use of simulation tools and advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles further emphasizes the importance of considering these factors in ride-pooling system design.
- The specific findings on passengers arriving late, pick-up stop times, and the impact of passenger baggage show how different variables contribute to overall system efficiency.
