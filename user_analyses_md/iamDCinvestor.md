## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 5 keywords or tags for better postprocessing, based on the given tweets. First, I need to figure out the main themes from the tweets.

Looking at the tweets, there's a lot about Ethereum, DeFi, stablecoins, regulatory issues, and the future of AI like Grok. The key points seem to be: Ethereum's role in DeFi, the impact of regulations on the network, the shift from developer-focused to user-focused, and the potential of AI in the ecosystem. Also, there's mention of the dollar's devaluation and the importance of ETH as a programmable asset.

So the main tags could be: Ethereum DeFi, Regulatory Impact, AI Integration, Stablecoins, and Market Dynamics. These cover the major topics discussed. I need to make sure they're distinct and relevant. Let me check again to confirm these are the most prominent.
