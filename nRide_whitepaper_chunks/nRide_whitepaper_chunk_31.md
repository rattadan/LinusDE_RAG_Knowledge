This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

Proposals can include changes to the messaging protocol, the escrow mechanism, the registry,
or any other aspect of the platform. Token holders can also vote on proposals put forward by other members
of the community. The voting system is based on a one-token, one-vote principle, meaning that the weight
of each token is equal to the vote it represents. The nRide DAO is designed to be as transparent and decentralized as possible, with all decisions made by
community members through a consensus-driven process. The DAOâ€™s budget is financed by the initial treasury, as well as the proceeds from the escrow contract, in those cases where both users cancel or let the escrow timeout. By putting the power of decision-making in the hands of token holders, nRide aims to create a platform that
is truly owned and operated by its users. The decentralized nature of the DAO ensures that no single entity
or group can dominate the decision-making process, and that the future of nRide is shaped by the community as a whole. 7.
