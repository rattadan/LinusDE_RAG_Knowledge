## Chunk 65

**Original Text:**

In a pre-swap or swap related error, the user will end up with the same tokens they started with on their initial chain (e.g. ATOM on Neutron in this example)
In a pre-swap or swap related error, the user will end up with the same tokens they started with on their initial chain (e.g. ATOM on Neutron in this example)

Post-swap failures:
Description: These are failures that occur on the sequence of transfers between the swap venue chain and the user’s destination chain, after the user’s origin tokens have already been successfully swapped for their desired destination asset. Outcome / What to Expect: The user’s newly purchased destination asset tokens will be transferred to their address on the swap chain. (This is the address passed to chains_to_addresses in /fungible/msgs for the chain where the swap takes place, which is given by swap_venue.chain_id in the response from /fungible/route)
Common failure sources:
Inactive relayers on a channel allow a packet to timeout
The user / frontend provides an invalid address for the destination chain
An IBC client on the destination chain has expired
Examples: Consider a route where the source asset is ATOM on Neutron, the destination asset is STRIDE on Stride, and the swap takes place on Osmosis:
Suppose the swap took place and the transfer to Stride has been initiated, but the Relayer between Osmosis and Stride is down.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

You're describing a situation where, after successfully swapping tokens from one chain to another, you end up with the same tokens you started with on your initial chain.

In this case, it's likely that an error occurred during the swap process or in the post-swap transfer phase. Here are some potential causes:

1. **Relayer downtime**: If the relayer between the two chains is down, it may not be able to handle incoming packets from one chain and forward them to the other, causing a timeout.
2. **Invalid address issue**: The user's frontend might have provided an invalid destination address, which would prevent the swap from completing successfully.
3. **IBC client expiration**: If an IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) client on the destination chain has expired, it may not be able to handle transactions, leading to a post-swap failure.

To troubleshoot this issue, you could try:

1. Verifying the relayer status and checking if it's down before attempting the swap.
2. Double-checking the user's frontend input to ensure they entered the destination address correctly.
3. Checking the IBC client expiration dates on the destination chain to see if there are any issues with transactions.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to investigate further and contact support or the platform administrators for assistance.
