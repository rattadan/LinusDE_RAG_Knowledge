This appears to be a legitimate account focused on cryptocurrency trading education and tools.

Contextualizing this tweet with what we know about cryptocurrency trading accounts:
This tweet follows a common pattern where the account establishes credibility by sharing a fundamental trading principle ("Risk management > signal accuracy"), then points out a common mistake among retail traders (over-leveraging), and finally offers their own solution to a perceived problem (market noise). This helps build trust before promoting their service.
