Histogram of the distributions of (a) Waiting times (b) Walking times (c) Total delay. 3.2.2. Global results over Manhattan
Let us first focus on the direct effects of introducing walks. To do so, we compare in Table 6 the results obtained by the system when
walking is admitted or not. Three scenarios are considered, which allows us to analyze whether the impact of allowing walks depends
on different conditions. The three scenarios are:
(i) 3000 vehicles of capacity 6 (considered as the base scenario for the posterior analyses). (ii) 2000 vehicles of capacity 9. (iii) Same fleet as in scenario (i) but considering users’ costs only (i.e. c0 = 0, as in Alonso-Mora et al., 2017). We consider again pw = pa = 2pv , pKO = 80pv , and c0 = 1.5pv in the first two scenarios. Table 6 also shows average users’ costs, the percentage of non-rejected requests that are actually requested to walk, and VHT in
thousands. Waiting and walking times’ units, as well as delays’, are minutes.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details and parameters involved in a ridesharing system's performance analysis. Here's a focused analysis:

**1. The exact technical details:**

- **Waiting Time Histogram:** The text describes a histogram of waiting times (in minutes) for users, indicating that there are various distributions and ranges.
- **Walking Time Histogram:** Similar to the waiting time histogram, it shows multiple distributions and ranges related to walking times.
- **Total Delay Distribution:** A distribution showing total delay in terms of minutes.

**2. How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:**

This section is part of a broader discussion on ridesharing systems, specifically focusing on their performance analysis and optimization strategies. The data presented here provides insights into user behavior, system dynamics, and potential improvements by incorporating walkable infrastructure.

**3. Any specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

- **Vehicle Capacity:** The scenarios involve different vehicle capacities (6, 9, and the same capacity but with reduced costs).
- **User Costs:** The inclusion of c0 = 1.5pv implies that users may incur additional costs when walking.
- **Meeting Points:** The text discusses the benefits of introducing meeting points into flex-route transit services, indicating a potential condition or requirement for such systems.

This chunk provides technical details and insights into ridesharing system performance analysis, including user behavior, infrastructure integration, and optimization strategies.
