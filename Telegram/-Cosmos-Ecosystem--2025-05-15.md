## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The user provided a list of chat messages with timestamps and authors. Let me go through each message and pick out the important information.

Starting from the earliest messages. There are several "unknown" messages. The first few mention a scam where fake users discuss getting crypto and then post a fake link. The advice is to ban unknown users. Then there's a message about Cosmos Voice #5 happening on May 18th with details about the event and a reminder link. BigNameOnchain asks for a tour, but maybe that's just a question without a decision. 

Then SparcoGx and Forthex talk about the StreamSwap presale for $ATC tokens on Osmosis, ending soon. They mention a deposit of $10k and urge participation. There's a link to the StreamSwap and tokenomics. Also, a reminder to deposit USDC within 30 minutes to get ATC tokens. 

Asa332's message mentions the end of the Sunrise testnet on May 20th and a Haru NFT snapshot on May 21st. Participants need to have their Haru equipped by then. 

Another message from wlkatja announces the winners of the WardenProtocol x Orbofi AI Agents contest, directing them to check Discord. 

BasementNodes and others have some off-topic messages like "Hey r u snigle" and "I forgot I could ban here," but those might not be key points. The user wants the summary to focus on key points and decisions, so maybe those can be omitted unless they indicate administrative actions.

So the main points are:
1. Scam alert: fake users discussing SOL and sharing a fake link. Decision to ban unknown users.
2. Cosmos Voice #5 event on May 18th with Rob Stack and Greg.
3. StreamSwap presale for ATC tokens ending soon (SparcoGx and Forthex's messages), $10k deposited, final hours to join.
4. Sunrise testnet ends May 20th, Haru NFT snapshot on May 21st.
5. Contest winners announced by wlkatja.

I should structure the summary with these points, highlighting the decisions and key events. Avoid the less relevant messages like the banter about being single or the Telegram girls

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string.

First, I need to go through each message and identify the key points. The text has several entries from different users with timestamps. Each entry seems to be a chat message, so I should read through them one by one.

Starting with the first message from BasementNodes: "not just full rights to hit on extremely real telegram girls". Hmm, "hit on telegram girls" might be a topic here, but "full rights" could be part of that context. Maybe "Telegram Girls" is the main topic here.

Next, wlkatja announces the winners of the @wardenprotocol x Orbofi AI Agents contest and mentions checking the Discord channel. The main topics here are "Wardenprotocol Orbofi AI Agents Contest Winners" and "Discord Announcement Channel".

Then there's a message from Asa332 with a link to a tweet about Cosmos Ecosystem. Since it's just a link, maybe "Cosmos Ecosystem News" is a topic, but I should check other mentions. The user might be referring to updates or news related to Cosmos.

Another unknown user says, "You have full admin rights here, my friend". That's about "Admin Rights in Telegram Chat". Then BasementNodes mentions banning users, so "Banning Users in Telegram Chat" is another topic. The same user later talks about scam activities involving fake users and links, which points to "Scam Activities in Telegram Chat" and "Fake Users Promoting Scam Links".

BasementNodes also asks "Hey r u snigle" ‚Äì probably a typo for "single". That's about "Asking About Relationship Status".

SparcoGx and others mention the StreamSwap deposit, ATC airdrop, and presale. So topics here would be "StreamSwap Deposit", "$ATC Airdrop", "$ATC Presale on Osmosis", and "Tokenomics of $ATC".

Another unknown user posts about Cosmos Voice #5, Cosmoverse '25, planning travel, and a video meeting. So "Cosmos Voice #5 Event", "Cosmoverse '25", "Event Planning and Travel", and "Cosmos Ecosystem Telegram Chat" are topics here.

Forthex talks about the ATC StreamSwap ending soon and recommends checking tokenomics

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by going through each message one by one.

First, there's a message from BasementNodes saying, "not just full rights to hit on extremely real telegram girls." The phrase "hit on" might have a negative connotation, but "extremely real" could be positive. However, depending on context, this might be inappropriate or sarcastic. I'm leaning towards negative here because it could be seen as disrespectful.

Next, wlkatja announces contest winners and congratulates them, which is clearly positive. They mention a celebration emoji and a link, so the sentiment here is positive.

Asa332 shares a Twitter link. Neutral since it's just a link without commentary.

Unknown user says, "You have full admin rights here, my friend." That sounds positive, maybe friendly or empowering. So positive.

BasementNodes at 14:18:00 says "lol I forgot I could ban here." The "lol" indicates humor, so neutral or maybe slightly positive, but it's just a realization, so probably neutral.

Another unknown user tells someone to ban unknown users discussing where to get crypto. This is about security, so the sentiment here is negative because they're warning about potential scams.

Then there's a detailed message about a scam where fake users discuss getting SOL and link to a fake site. The user explains the scam method, which is negative due to the mention of cheating and scams.

BasementNodes asks, "Hey r u snigle" (assuming "snigle" is a typo for "single"). This seems like a casual or maybe flirtatious message. Depending on context, it could be neutral or negative if it's unwelcome. Since it's in a group chat, maybe neutral, but the typo might be intentional. Not sure, but probably neutral.

SparcoGx mentions a deposit of $10k into StreamSwap and encourages depositing USDC for ATC tokens. They use emojis like ü§Ø and üòé, which are positive. The message is promoting something, so positive.

Unknown users post the same Twitter link multiple times. Repeating the same message is neutral, just sharing information.

The Cosmos Voice #5 announcement is repeated three times. It's an event promotion with emojis and details, so positive.

BigNameOnchain says they're here and asks who cares to show them around. The

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any tasks, decisions, or steps that need to be taken.

Starting with the latest message from Asa332 about the Sunrise testnet ending on May 20th. They mention taking a snapshot on May 21st, so participants need to ensure their Haru NFTs are equipped with desired items before the 20th. That's a clear action item: participants should prepare their NFTs by the deadline.

Next, SparcoGx and Forthex both talk about the StreamSwap presale for $ATC tokens. The presale is ending soon, so the action here is to deposit USDC within the remaining time to get ATC tokens. Also, SparcoGx mentions a link to like and share, which might be a recommendation to promote the presale, but the user might need to check if that's an action item or just a suggestion. Since it's presented as a recommendation, maybe it's optional, but the main step is contributing before the deadline.

Looking at the unknown user's messages about scams. They discuss a new scam method where fake users talk about getting crypto and sharing a link. The instruction is to ban unknown users discussing where to get crypto. So that's a decision or action item for admins to monitor and ban such users.

BasementNodes mentions having full admin rights and the ability to ban. They also forgot they could ban, so maybe reinforcing that admins should actively use their rights. But the main action from the unknown user's message is to ban those users.

Other messages like the winners announcement and Cosmos Voice #5 event are informational but don't have specific actions unless attending the event is required. However, the user might consider setting a reminder for the event as a next step. The links provided for the event could be part of that, but the user says "check our Announcement Channel" which is an action item for the winners.

Wait, the user might also need to check if there are any deadlines or required actions from the winners. The SparcoGx message mentions winners being announced and checking the Discord channel. So the action item here is to check the Discord announcement channel to see if they're a winner.

BigNameOnchain asks for a tour, but that's more of
