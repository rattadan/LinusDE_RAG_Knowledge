   - This could be a legitimate concern for investors or community members.

By asking this question publicly, the account is potentially trying to address community concerns about whether early investors and team members continue to benefit from staking rewards while their tokens are locked up in vesting schedules. This could be part of a broader strategy to build trust with the community by acknowledging and discussing potential governance issues.
