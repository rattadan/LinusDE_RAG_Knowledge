## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 37

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Proportion of trips made under 10 min without DRS was
nearly 20% more as when rides are shared. Time spent walking to and waiting at a stop, which is
about 4 to 5 min, increases trip travel times slightly. An average 5-10 min added time may be
acceptable for most non-emergency trip types, given the expected low cost of SAV travel. Extreme bins with travel times longer than 30 min are only seen with DRS but are less than 5%
of all trips. This is expected with some travelers penalized more than others depending on the
origin-destination pair and the time of day. Large VMT savings allowing for better traffic flow
along with subsidized shared rides can make the service attractive with optimized matching
algorithms. 11

Increased trip densities of 5x and 25x the current density improve certain fleet metrics but can
add congestion on links with these PUDOs.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

* The chunk describes the proportion of trips made under 10 minutes without Distance Reduction Strategy (DRS) benefits, which was nearly 20% more compared to when rides are shared.
* Time spent walking to and waiting at a stop is approximately 4-5 minutes.

**Context:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing specific data on trip travel times before and after sharing rides with autonomous vehicles (SAVs).
2. Describing the benefits of SAVs, including increased trip densities, which can improve certain fleet metrics.
3. Mentioning that large VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) savings can lead to better traffic flow and make the service more attractive.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

* The chunk assumes a basic understanding of shared autonomous vehicles, congestion pricing, parking needs, consumer preferences, optimization techniques, vehicle ownership impacts, and electric mobility services.
* It also requires knowledge of the context provided in the surrounding text, including the timeframe spanning from 2014 to 2020.

**Specific Requirements:**

* The chunk does not require specific technical expertise or specialized knowledge beyond a basic understanding of transportation systems and SAVs.
* However, it may be helpful for readers with an interest in urban transportation systems, mobility services, and optimization techniques.
