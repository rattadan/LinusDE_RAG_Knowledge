## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 83

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Negative values can occur when the strategy under consideration
has worse quality and higher costs (highlighted in italic typeface) or
better quality and lower costs than the nearest strategy. Please note

Fig. 4. Waiting time of the best assignment strategy in different settings with varying
fleet sizes. 6.3. Repositioning analysis
In this section, we compare the quality of the repositioning strategies presented in Section 5 for different problem settings. For all
experiments, the best assignment strategy according to the results from
Section 6.2 is used. Unless stated otherwise, we set the repositioning
interval to ùõøùëÖ = 15 min. Because our undersupply probability strategy
requires a defined radius for the parking lot zones (which is usually set
to ùëáùëä ), we must select a specific value for settings without a maximum
waiting time. In our experiments, we use the average waiting time of
the best benchmark strategy. Which repositioning strategy works best in which setting?
