## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 20

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Requests that have origins and destinations more than 1 mi away are allowed to be
picked up and dropped off without having the traveler walk to a PUDO. In this case, SAVs may
idle in suburban links, and away from congested roads. DATASET AND SCENARIOS
In this paper, SAVs are simulated in the Bloomington region of the U.S. state of Illinois, to
understand the effectiveness of aggregating SAV trips spatially by PUDO zones in boosting
DRS. Bloomington is a small region, encompassing 74 square miles and home to about 120,000
residents. Its network has just 4,000 links and 2,500 nodes, which are 89 and 92% less than the
comparable values for the Chicago region, respectively. The POLARIS activity-based model of
tours and travel demand is quite behaviorally flexible and realistic, enabling certain traveler
choices that other SAV simulations lack like the destination choice that has not been
implemented in MATSim (Horni et al., 2016).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section provides technical details on the configuration of a Simulation Area of Vegetation Coverage (SAV) using the POLARIS activity-based model for travel demand simulation, specifically within the Bloomington region of Illinois. Here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The SAV is allowed to idle in suburban links, away from congested roads.
* SAVs are simulated in the Bloomington region (74 square miles) using the POLARIS activity-based model.
* The network has 4,000 links and 2,500 nodes, which are 89% and 92% less than comparable values for the Chicago region, respectively.
* The model is quite behaviorally flexible and realistic.

**Context Connection:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by providing specific technical details on a simulation setup for SAVs within the Bloomington region. It explains how the POLARIS activity-based model can be used to simulate the travel demand in this region, highlighting its behavioral flexibility and realism.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

None are mentioned in this chunk. However, it's worth noting that the specific technical details provided may require computational resources and data availability for large-scale simulations, which might impose constraints on the feasibility of such a study.
