## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 56

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Since this strategy creates (overlapping) zones
around each existing parking lot, we consider meaningful, problemrelated zones that explicitly integrate the information about the parking
lot locations as well as the available time to respond to a request. By
doing so, contrary to the other approaches, we also overcome potential
discretization issues during zone creation. Preliminaries. The key element of the strategy is to determine how
important or valuable an additional vehicle for a given parking lot
would be. For that, we first determine the expected short-term future
demand 𝑑 in the respective parking lot zone as well as the supply
𝑠 in this zone. Then, an undersupply probability for that lot zone is
computed using a Poisson distribution:
𝑝undersupply =

∞
∑
𝑑 𝑘 𝑒−𝑑
𝑘! 𝑘=𝑠+1

(7)

Formula (7) gives the probability of more incoming requests in the
short-term future than available vehicles in this lot zone. The higher
this probability, the better it is to send an additional vehicle to this
parking lot.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is describing a dynamic routing strategy for shared autonomous ride-hailing systems.

**Technical details:**

* The strategy considers "meaningful, problem-related zones" that integrate parking lot locations and available time.
* It uses a Poisson distribution formula to compute the probability of undersupply (i.e., more incoming requests than available vehicles) in each zone.
* The formula is:
𝑝undersupply = ∞
∑
𝑑 𝑘 𝑒−𝑑
𝑘! 𝑘=𝑠+1

**Context:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by mentioning that it is part of a broader research effort on optimizing ride-hailing system operations, specifically on dynamic optimization models for managing fleet operations. The text also mentions previous studies and techniques (e.g., machine learning) being applied in this area.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

* This strategy requires an understanding of parking lot locations, available time, and demand forecasts to determine the importance of additional vehicles.
* It assumes that a Poisson distribution is appropriate for modeling undersupply probabilities, which may not always be accurate (e.g., due to external factors like traffic or weather).
* The strategy also implies that it can handle scenarios with varying levels of demand and parking lot constraints.
