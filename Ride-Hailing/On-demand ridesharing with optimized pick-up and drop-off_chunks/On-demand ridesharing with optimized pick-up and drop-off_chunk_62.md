**Original Text:**

The second rule reduces the flexibility of the system to reassign each time someone
walks. The third rule prevents a new source of flexibility to emerge thanks to walking. Therefore, we are considering an extreme
version of the trade-off, in which walking reduces flexibility as much as possible. If any of these rules were modified, then walking

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk focuses on the following aspects:

1. **Technical details**: The rules mentioned are the "Third Rule" and its modification, which involve reducing flexibility in two different ways (reassigning individuals walking or introducing new sources of flexibility). The technical parameters involved include:
	* Reducing flexibility: This involves changing a rule to minimize flexibility.
	* Reassigning individuals walking: This requires modifying an existing rule to change the assignment of individuals from one location to another.
2. **Context building**: This chunk connects to the surrounding context by discussing various aspects of ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems, including:
	* The key themes discussed earlier (Rebalancing Strategies, Modeling and Mathematical Frameworks, Optimization Heuristics, Simulation and Service Design, Flexible Transport Services, Ride-Sharing Systems with Meeting Points, Vehicle Rebalancing for Mobility-on-Demand Systems, Flex-Route Services and Ride-Sharing, Reinforcement Learning Approaches).
	* The summary of key papers provided earlier.
3. **Requirements and conditions**: This chunk is more implicit but still relevant:
	* The goal of the research: To improve ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems by incorporating meeting points into transportation networks.

Specifically, this chunk is explaining how to reduce flexibility in a transportation system (in this case, one that includes ride-sharing services) through two different methods:

1. Modifying an existing rule to change the assignment of individuals from one location to another.
2. Introducing new sources of flexibility by removing or reducing the ability to reassign individuals.

The chunk is building upon and connecting to the surrounding context in several ways, including referencing key themes, summarizing key papers, and highlighting specific requirements and conditions discussed earlier.
