## Chunk 47

**Original Text:**

Both parties receive
0 times their initial deposit. 3.3. Implications
How do users receive compensation when their counterparties cancel or fail to fulfill an obligation? If the counterparty decides to cancel a confirmed commitment, they have two options: actively cancel and
provide their secret code to the other user or do nothing. If they choose to provide their secret code, the
other user can submit the Approve(secret) message to receive a cancellation fee of 1.3 or 1.5 times their initial deposit, depending on the timing of the cancellation.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems there's some confusion in the text you provided. It appears to be describing a scenario involving two parties agreeing to exchange digital assets (likely cryptocurrencies) and how they might interact if one party cancels an agreement.

To clarify, here are the implications:

1. **Initial Deposits**: When users initially deposit their digital assets, it's likely that both parties agree on a specific amount or threshold for each deposit.
2. **Cancellation Options**: If a user decides to cancel their commitment, they have two options:
   - **Active Cancellation**: They can choose to actively cancel the agreement and initiate a "cancellation fee" process. This involves providing their secret code (or cryptographic key) to the other party.
   - **No Action**: Alternatively, if a user chooses not to act, they forfeit any potential cancellation fees.
3. **Cancellation Fees**: The amount of the cancellation fee varies depending on when and how the agreement is cancelled:
   - If the counterparty cancels after the agreement has been confirmed (before depositing), they receive a cancellation fee of 1.3 times their initial deposit.
   - If the counterparty cancels before depositing, they receive a cancellation fee of 1.5 times their initial deposit.

To summarize, when users initially deposit their digital assets and later cancel their commitment, they can choose to either actively cancel and receive a specific cancellation fee or forfeit any potential fee if the agreement is cancelled after being confirmed but before depositing.
