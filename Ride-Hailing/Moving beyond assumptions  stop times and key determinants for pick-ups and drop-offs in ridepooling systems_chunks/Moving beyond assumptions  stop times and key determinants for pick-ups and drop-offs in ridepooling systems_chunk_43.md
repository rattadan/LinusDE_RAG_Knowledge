**Original Text:**

Nonetheless, our results align with their findings and underscore the need to distinguish between pick-ups and drop-offs in future DRT
investigations. A key advantage of our method used to collect stop time data is the detailed observation
of each determinant that could impact stop time during the actual operation of the vehicle. That approach enables the use of a regression model with specific independent variables
for boarding and alighting stops. The R2 values of our models are comparable to those from
studies on PT dwell times using linear regression, demonstrating a relatively high level of
explanatory power (Glick and Figliozzi 2017). Our model results reveal that the conditions
of the stop location are an influencing factor. PUDO events at virtual stops exhibit shorter
durations than those at PT stops. This could imply that enhanced infrastructural conditions
at PT stops contribute to a heightened sense of safety during stop maneuvers, thereby facilitating more relaxed stopping procedures.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis 1: Technical Details and Parameters**

The current text chunk describes the use of regression modeling to analyze the relationship between stop time data collected from various sources (e.g., PUDO events at virtual stops vs. PT stops) and specific independent variables (e.g., conditions of the stop location). The models used have relatively high explanatory power, as indicated by R2 values comparable to those from studies using linear regression.

**Analysis 2: Connection to surrounding context**

The current text chunk connects to the broader context by highlighting the importance of understanding operational aspects and sustainability impacts in ride-pooling services. This is reinforced by the mention of various studies discussing the implementation and efficiency of ride-pooling services, as well as the focus on urban transport systems and sustainability.

**Analysis 3: Requirements, conditions, or constraints**

There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this text chunk that would impact its functionality. The models used are assumed to be feasible for collection and analysis of stop time data from various sources, and there are no limitations or assumptions about the accuracy or reliability of the data.

**Focused Analysis: Understanding Stop Time Data**

The current text chunk explains how regression modeling is used to analyze stop time data collected from different sources. The models have relatively high explanatory power, indicating a good fit between observed and predicted values. This suggests that the analysis can provide valuable insights into the relationship between independent variables (e.g., conditions of the stop location) and dependent variables (e.g., stop duration).

The chunk also highlights the importance of understanding operational aspects and sustainability impacts in ride-pooling services, reinforcing the broader context discussed earlier. By analyzing stop time data, researchers can gain a better understanding of how different factors influence travel times and contribute to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of shared mobility solutions.

**Additional Insights**

Further analysis could explore:

* The limitations and potential biases of the regression models used
* The impact of additional independent variables (e.g., road conditions, traffic density) on stop time data
* The potential for using machine learning algorithms to improve model performance or incorporate new data sources

Overall, this text chunk provides a clear explanation of how regression modeling is used to analyze stop time data, highlighting its strengths and limitations. By exploring additional insights into these models, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing ride-pooling services and contribute to the development of more effective shared mobility solutions.
