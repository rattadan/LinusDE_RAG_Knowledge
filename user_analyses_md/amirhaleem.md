**Putting tweets in context:**
Amir positions himself as both an evangelist and strategic operator within decentralized infrastructure ecosystems. His messaging balances between celebrating growth milestones (revenue highs on Solana) while also addressing practical implementation challenges (gateway deployment guides). By juxtaposing network growth ("growing and growing") with criticism of "legacy telcos," he frames decentralized alternatives as inevitable disruptors rather than experimental projects. The emphasis on physical deployment resources suggests he values grassroots participation as much as high-level metrics.
