2. Language style and tone:
   - The message is extremely brief and basic
   - It uses a casual greeting in Polish
   - The tone is neutral and friendly
   - No complex language or jargon is used

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
   - This appears to be a legitimate post from the official "Cosmos Ecosystem" channel
   - The message is consistent with what might be expected from an official channel (a greeting)
   - However, it's very minimalistic in content

4. Ecosystem/project advertised:
   - The account is clearly promoting/representing the Cosmos Ecosystem
   - Cosmos is a network of independent, scalable, interoperable blockchains
   - The account's title includes "\u269b\ufe0f Cosmos Ecosystem \u269b\ufe0f" (with the ⚙️ emoji)

5. Evaluation of author's character:
   - Since this is an official channel account, not an individual, I'll analyze the organizational character rather than personal character
   - Communication style appears professional yet minimalistic
   - Potential motivations: onboarding Polish-speaking community members to the Cosmos Ecosystem
   - Values seem to include accessibility and multilingual outreach
   - Emotional patterns: neutral, formal
   - Decision-making approach: appears to be following a strategy of reaching out to different language communities
   - List of discussed topics: only a greeting, no specific topics discussed yet
   - No interacted users evident from this single message (no replies, no mentions)

Now, let me generate 5 matching keywords/tags:
1. #CosmosEcosystem

3. #PolishCommunity
4. #CryptoGreeting
