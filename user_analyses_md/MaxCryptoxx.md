The tweets are about cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum. The main themes are the parabolic phase of Bitcoin, ETH pump, altcoins, and the upcoming fork. 

Next, the language style and tone. The user uses emojis like ðŸš€, ðŸ’¥, and ðŸš©, which indicate excitement and urgency. The tone is highly motivational and enthusiastic, with phrases like "will get rewarded for patience" and "your patience will be rewarded."
