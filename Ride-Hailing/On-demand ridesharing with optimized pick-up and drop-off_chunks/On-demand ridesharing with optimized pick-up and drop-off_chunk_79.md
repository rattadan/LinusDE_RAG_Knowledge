**Original Text:**

Table 5 synthesizes the most relevant charac¬≠
teristics of the network and the requests. The last two rows refer to WD(u) (u ‚àà ùí±), which is the set of nodes that are at ‚Äúwalking
distance‚Äù from the node u, i.e., that can be visited walking in less than Œ©A = 12[min]. Such rows show that the set of feasible PUDO
points for each request is large, which justifies searching for the best ones with the heuristic described in subSection 2.4. 16

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the text chunk:

**Technical details and parameters:**

* The table at the end (Table 5) appears to be a statistical analysis or a benchmarking study, with columns representing different metrics such as user costs, average wait times, average walk times, and average delay.
* The data points in Table 6 seem to represent scenarios of users walking versus being driven around Manhattan.

**Context:**

The text chunk is connected to the surrounding context through several elements:

* The table at the end appears to be a part of the same document or reference list that summarizes key papers on ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems.
* The discussion of Table 6 highlights some common metrics or characteristics that are relevant to these topics, such as user costs, average wait times, walk times, and delay rates.
* The text chunk also assumes a context where it is being used for analysis or comparison of different scenarios, which suggests that the surrounding document or reference list provides an overview or summary of key papers on ridesharing.

**Requirements and conditions:**

None mentioned in this specific section. However, the overall context implies that the text chunk is likely part of a larger report or paper that aims to summarize recent research on ridesharing systems and mobility-on-demand technologies.
