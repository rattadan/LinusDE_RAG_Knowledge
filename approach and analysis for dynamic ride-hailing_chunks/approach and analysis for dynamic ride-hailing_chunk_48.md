**Original Text:**

In our
study, we use zones of size 1 × 1 km and edge-based neighborhoods,
defining zones as neighbors only when they share an edge. In case there
are multiple vehicles available for switching zones, the vehicle closest
to the center of the destination zone is selected. For the destination,
the parking lot in the destination zone closest to the selected vehicle
is chosen. This follows the original idea by Fagnant and Kockelman
(2014) to let vehicles just cross the zone border. In case there are no
parking lots within the destination zone, the parking lot closest to the
zone’s center is picked. While this repositioning strategy does reposition
the fleet in an anticipatory fashion, it restricts the movements to a
rather local area. Global matching. A more global and simultaneously intuitive repositioning approach is to distribute the fleet in the same way the demand
is distributed without restricting vehicle movements to only neighboring zones.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the specified text chunk:

1. **Technical details**: The technical details discussed are about dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on zone-based neighborhoods, edge-based routing, and parking lot selection.
2. **Context connection and building upon surrounding context**: This chunk connects to the broader topic by discussing simulation methodologies (Bischoff & Maciejewski, Braverman et al., Ho et al.), demand forecasting methods (Geng et al., Fagnant & Kockelman), and rebalancing strategies (Guo et al. Dandl et al.). It builds upon these surrounding contexts by providing a more detailed explanation of the zone-based approach.
3. **Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints**: None are mentioned in this chunk.

The specified text is explaining how to use zones as a basis for dynamic dispatch and repositioning in ride-hailing systems, particularly when dealing with demand forecasting and rebalancing strategies. It discusses the trade-off between local movement restrictions and global matching approaches, highlighting that distributing the fleet without neighboring zone constraints might be more intuitive but may not always achieve optimal results.
