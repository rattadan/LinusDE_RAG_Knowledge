**Original Text:**

Because the waiting time for the customers usually
varies depending on the fleet utilization, we define different values
for 𝑇𝑊 for different 𝐷𝑆𝑅𝑠. To find reasonable values, we took the
50% and 90% quantiles of the customer waiting time for the 𝑉 =
100 fleet without the maximum waiting time constraint, resulting in
one very restrictive waiting time 𝑇𝑊1 and one less restrictive waiting
time 𝑇𝑊2 . For 𝐷𝑆𝑅 = 40, we use 𝑇𝑊1 = 103 s and 𝑇𝑊2 = 218 s,
and for 𝐷𝑆𝑅 ∈ {70, 100}, we use 𝑇𝑊1 = 271 s and 𝑇𝑊2 = 1029 s. For each problem configuration under consideration, the framework
simulates five different work days. When comparing different strategies

Please note that in both situations, vehicles that are available for
repositioning are removed from the supply before the start of the calculations. Because of that, it is not necessary to consider the reduction
in supply in a specific area when vehicles are sent to other areas.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* 𝑉 = 100 (fleet size)
* 𝐷𝑆𝑅 ∈ {40, 70, 100} (demand specifications)
* The waiting times for customer waiting time (𝑇𝑊) are calculated using the 50% and 90% quantiles of the customer waiting time without the maximum waiting time constraint.

**Context Connection and Requirements:**

This chunk is connected to the surrounding context by establishing the problem statement, which involves dynamic dispatch and repositioning in ride-hailing systems. The framework simulates different work days for each demand specification, resulting in varying waiting times and fleet utilization rates.

The technical details provided (𝑉 = 100, 𝐷𝑆𝑅 ∈ {40, 70, 100}) suggest that the problem is focused on optimizing dynamic dispatch strategies under various demand specifications. The use of quantiles indicates a concern with handling uncertainties in customer waiting times.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

The requirements mentioned include:

* Finding reasonable waiting time values (𝑇𝑊1 and 𝑇𝑊2) for different demand specifications
* Evaluating the impact of fleet utilization rates on waiting times
* Optimizing dynamic dispatch strategies under various demand conditions

Conditions mentioned include:

* Vehicles being removed from the supply before repositioning, due to not considering the reduction in supply in specific areas.
* The simulation running over five different work days for each problem configuration.

Overall, this chunk provides technical details and context for analyzing dynamic dispatch strategies in ride-hailing systems, while also establishing requirements and conditions for evaluating these strategies.
