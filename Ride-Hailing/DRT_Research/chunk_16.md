## Chunk 16

**Original Text:**

The modeling tools that are adapted in this paper to approximate the costs for the agency and users of the DRT service are presented in Section 3. Then in Section 4, the system optimum problem is formulated to minimize the total cost of the agency and users in three possible scenarios: optimizing the operating capacity of the service, optimizing the number of waiting requests, and optimizing both together. In these scenarios, the system optimum problem also has an analytical solution when the distribution of the wished request time is known. Section 5 presents the demand management strategies that can keep the number of requests awaiting service constantly optimized over time. Section 6 provides a numerical example of a DRT system and an optimal pricing strategy as well as a sensitivity analysis on the results.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're providing a summary or structure for a research paper on Demand Response Transmission (DRT) systems, specifically addressing cost optimization and demand management strategies. Here's a breakdown of what I've gathered:

1. **Modeling Tools**: The paper likely utilizes specific modeling tools to simulate the costs associated with different DRT scenarios.

2. **System Optimum Problem Formulation**: This involves creating a mathematical model that minimizes total costs for both the agency and users, considering three possible optimization scenarios: 
   - Optimizing operating capacity
   - Optimizing waiting request times
   - Combining these optimizations

3. **Analytical Solution in Certain Scenarios**: The system optimum problem has an analytical solution when specific distribution parameters (e.g., wished request time distribution) are known.

4. **Demand Management Strategies**: This section likely addresses strategies to maintain the optimal number of requests waiting for service over time, possibly including pricing and scheduling decisions.

5. **Numerical Example and Sensitivity Analysis**: A real-world example of a DRT system is provided along with an example that includes an optimal pricing strategy and sensitivity analysis on results.

Given this summary, it seems like your paper aims to explore the optimization of DRT systems' costs through the lens of demand management strategies and analytical solutions under specific conditions.
