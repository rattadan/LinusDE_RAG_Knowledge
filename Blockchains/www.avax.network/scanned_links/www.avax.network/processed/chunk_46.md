with experimenting and exploring new ideas. Any founder can pivot, but making that pivot successful requires support from a network of mentors and advisors that can help crystalize and validate new ideas. For founders building on Avalanche, that often means providing founders with access to Ava Labsâ technical expertise, network, and tooling to support the development of their product. But building a great startup requires more than a technically excellent product and with Codebaseâs second cohort Ava Labs doubled down on support in all areas beyond the command line.Â

The Avalanche EffectÂ

During Codebaseâs 10-week intensive program, founders are provided with a variety of support mechanisms that allow them to go from idea to live testnet demo in under three months. There are twice-a-week sessions with Ava Labs staff and advisors that provide founders with a masterclass in all areas of company building that Martin refers to as an âWeb3 MBA.â But unlike business school, this curriculum isnât set in stone.Â

One of the workshops offered by Codebase as part of the incubator program is focused on executive and product storytelling, which is an essential skill for founders who are developing their product on Avalanche. Itâs a technical system that may be unfamiliar to the foundersâ potential customers or future investors, which means they need to be able to clearly and simply explain how it creates differentiated value for the end user. If the founder canât clear that bar, it wonât matter if theyâve built a great product that meets a critical customer need because no one will buy it. âWho cares about your idea if you don't know how to communicate it?" says Martin. "No one will care unless you can find a way to tell them otherwise."

Prioritizing Storytelling

Storytelling workshops have, as a result, always been an integral part of the Codebase program.
