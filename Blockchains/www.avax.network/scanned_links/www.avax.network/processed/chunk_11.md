## Source Context
*From: https://www.avax.network/*

### Document Overview  
The content provides key metrics and statistics about staking rewards, total stake, validation, and delegated stakes on the Avalanche network, including annual percentage yield (APY) and related fee structures.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Staking Rewards**: Percentage of AVAX earned by staking, e.g., 7.60% APY.  
- **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)**: Return on investment calculated as (Staking Rewards / Total Stake) × 365.  
- **Staking Ratio**: Proportion of validation stake relative to total stake (56.16% in this case).  
- **Total Stake**: Total AVAX staked across validators (247.6 million AVAX).  
- **Validation Stake**: Amount staked by validators (201.86 million AVAX).  
- **Delegated Stake**: Amount delegated to validators (45.74 million AVAX).  
- **Fee**: Cost for accepting delegations, with monthly and yearly rates (e.g., $11.37, $137.45).  
- **No Slashing**: Avalanche’s unique feature where staked tokens are immune to slashing penalties.  
- **Low Hardware Requirements**: Minimal computational demands for staking.  

### Implementation Details  
- **APY Calculation**: (Staking Rewards / Total Stake) × 365 (e.g., 7.60% / 247.6M = 7.60% APY).  
- **Staking Ratio**: Validation Stake / Total Stake (201.86M / 247.6M ≈ 56.16%).  
- **Fee Structures**: Monthly fee: $11.37 (0.71%), yearly: $137.45 (8.58%).  
- **Staking Calculator**: Displays APY, fee rates, and other metrics for users to estimate returns.  
- **No Slashing**: Validators are not penalized for staking, ensuring stability.  

### Related Topics  
- **Staking Calculator**: Connected to the APY and fee details provided.  
- **No Slashing**: Mentioned as a key feature contrasting with other blockchains.  
- **Low Hardware Requirements**: Highlighted as a technical advantage for staking.  
- **Fee Customization**: Users can set their own fees for delegations, linking to the "Earn up to 7.65% APY" section.
