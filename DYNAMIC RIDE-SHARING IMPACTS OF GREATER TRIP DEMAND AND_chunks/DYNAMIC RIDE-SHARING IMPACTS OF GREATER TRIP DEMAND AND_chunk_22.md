## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 22

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

So, a proportional increase in network capacity is also assumed for certain scenarios to focus
attention on comparing regions with different densities. Another set of scenarios are evaluated
when artificially aligning traveler preference toward SAV fleets to understand the other extreme
mode share, and consequent network impacts. In these scenarios, the personal auto modes are not
available for travelers to use, and they rely only on SAVs, non-motorized, and transit modes to
meet their travel needs. In the future, vehicle ownership is likely never to reach this extreme (of
zero vehicles per household) with high value of travel time travelers preferring personal modes
for convenience and privacy, but studies like Menon et al. (2019) have showed that reduced
vehicle ownership, especially in urban centers of large regions, is the expected preference. The
ordered probit model outlined in Menon et al.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**
The technical details described in this chunk are related to data analysis and statistical modeling.

* Ordered Probit Model: This is a type of regression model used for analyzing categorical variables with continuous outcomes.
* Ordered Probit Modeling: In this context, the ordered probit model is being used to analyze how consumer preferences (mode share) influence network impacts of shared autonomous vehicle fleets. Specifically, it's used to understand how the mode share of personal auto modes versus shared autonomous vehicles (SAV) affects the demand for different types of transportation services.

**Context Connection and Building Upon:**
This chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

* Providing a brief introduction to the topic of shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance.
* Offering an overview of the references that will be discussed in further detail.
* Highlighting the specific focus on comparing regions with different densities, which is introduced in the next chunk.

The chunk also builds upon the surrounding context by setting up a framework for analyzing how consumer preferences influence network impacts. This is done by:

* Preparing the reader for an analysis of ordered probit models that will be used to explore this relationship.
* Providing a clear direction for the types of scenarios being evaluated (e.g., artificially aligning traveler preference towards SAV fleets).

**Requirements and Conditions:**
The requirements and conditions mentioned in this chunk are:

* The text assumes that the reader is familiar with the topic of shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance and its potential impacts on urban transportation systems.
* It expects the reader to have access to a comprehensive reference list covering various aspects of the topic, including scholarly articles and reports.

Note that there are no specific requirements or conditions mentioned in this chunk. The text appears to be providing general information and context for an analysis of shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance.
