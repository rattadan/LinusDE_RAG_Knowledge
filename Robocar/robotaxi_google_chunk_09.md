# Robotaxi Technology (Amazon Zoox) - Chunk 1
Amazon's Zoox robotaxi employs advanced sensor fusion technology that combines data from multiple sensor types to ensure comprehensive environmental awareness. The system integrates LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), cameras, and radar sensors to create a complete 360-degree perception of the vehicle's surroundings. This multi-modal approach provides redundancy and enhances safety by ensuring the vehicle can accurately detect and respond to obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles in complex urban environments, even in challenging weather or lighting conditions.
