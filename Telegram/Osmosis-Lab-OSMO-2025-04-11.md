## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I'll go through each message to understand the context.

Starting with the latest message: Mrtiahou says Eureka will serve Polaris for route. That seems important. Then BasementNodes says "All of them" ‚Äì not sure what that refers to without more context, but maybe related to previous discussions.

saysullivan is asking about what happens after Eureka on Cosmos Polaris and the differences between two concepts. The assistant should note that there's a question here about post-Eureka steps and distinctions.

Osmosis_statbot provides a support link, which might not be a key point unless the summary needs to mention support resources. Wcc8311 is asking about Euro LP in the future, and JohnnyWyles87 responds that they have EURe via Monerium but liquidity is bad. They mention contacting Monerium again. Also, Johnny explains that IBC Eureka uses Cosmos Hub's IBC v2 connection, adding an extra hop for liquidity provision, and they're focusing on that instead of more IBC v2 clients.

SoulRa1ser talks about USD dropping against Euro and requests integrating EURC from Circle, suggesting a 50/50 split between USD and Euro stables. user_343756695 and kychuli discuss whether Osmosis should connect directly to IBC Eureka or use the Hub, with kychuli saying assets can flow easily now but unsure if Osmosis should make its own connection. They mention it will benefit the ecosystem.

user_7164487109 mentions a GitHub repo and a Telegram channel for updates. user_7034835083 asks about OSMO token and how to be bullish. Mathiax and mikebarb have minor comments about fees set by pool creators and hiding, which might be less important. Fuerzaaaaa asks why fees are expensive with Secret Network.

Key points: IBC Eureka's implementation via Cosmos Hub with extra hop, liquidity issues with EURe and request for EURC integration, potential benefits for Polaris and ecosystem, Osmosis's connection strategy (using Hub vs. own), support resources mentioned, and fee-related questions. Decisions include focusing on IBC v2 connection via Cosmos Hub rather than

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects.

Starting with the first message from Mrtiahou: "Eureka will serve Polaris for route." So, Eureka, Polaris, and route are mentioned. Maybe "IBC Eureka" and "Polaris route" are topics here.

Next, BasementNodes says "All of them." That's vague, but in context, it might relate to previous discussions about connections or assets. Not sure, maybe not a main topic on its own.

Then saysullivan asks about Eureka on Cosmos Polaris and differences between two concepts. They mention "interchain" and "IBC v2 connection." So topics here could be IBC Eureka, Cosmos Hub, IBC v2, and differences in concepts.

Osmosis_statbot provides a support link. Not a main topic, but maybe "official support site" or "support resources" if needed.

Wcc8311 asks about Euro LP in the future. "Euro LP" and "future liquidity" come to mind.

JohnnyWyles87 talks about EURe via Monerium and liquidity issues. So "EURe (Monerium)", "liquidity problems", and "IBC v2 connection via Cosmos Hub."

Another JohnnyWyles87 message discusses IBC Eureka as IBC v2 connection, deposit flow, and liquidity provision. So reinforcing "IBC Eureka," "Cosmos Hub," and "liquidity provision challenges."

SoulRa1ser mentions USD to Euro drop, contacting Noble, integrating EURC from Circle. Topics here: "US dollar vs Euro exchange rate," "integration of EURC (Circle)," and "stablecoin diversification."

User_343756695 discusses using hubs for cheaper trades, Osmosis being the only choice for BTC trades. So "Cosmos Hub cost efficiency," "Osmosis BTC trading dominance," and "ecosystem asset integration."

Kychuli's messages mention assets added to alloy, assets flowing to Osmo, connections via hub or own. Topics: "asset integration into Alloy," "Cosmos Hub connection," "Osmosis asset flow," and "ecosystem benefits."

Another user asks if Osmosis is plugged into I

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first one: "Mrtiahou at 2025-04-11T21:23:11+00:00: Eureka will serve Polaris for route". That seems like a factual statement about a service or project. No obvious positive or negative words, so probably neutral.

Next: "BasementNodes at 2025-04-11T19:12:21+00:00: All of them". Very short. Without context, "All of them" could be neutral, maybe agreeing or confirming something. No sentiment here, so neutral.

Then: "saysullivan at 2025-04-11T19:04:33+00:00: after eureka on cosmos polaris do what in interchain ? which concept is diffrent on these tow ?". This is a question asking for clarification. The user is seeking information, not expressing emotion. Neutral.

"Osmosis_statbot at 2025-04-11T13:59:03+00:00: If you need help, visit our official support site, https://support.osmosis.zone". This is a bot providing support info. Neutral, as it's just a helpful message.

"Wcc8311 at 2025-04-11T13:49:32+00:00: So would we have euro lp in future". A question about future possibilities. The user is hopeful but not explicitly positive. Maybe neutral, unless "would we have" implies a desire, which could lean positive. But since it's a question, probably neutral.

"JohnnyWyles87 at 2025-04-11T10:55:44+00:00: They do have EURe via Monerium, but the liquidity is pretty awful still. We've contacted them about this before but will again!". Here, "liquidity is pretty awful" is negative. The user is pointing out a problem, so negative.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I'll read through each message carefully to see what's being discussed.

Starting with the latest message from Mrtiahou, they mention "Eureka will serve Polaris for route." That sounds like a decision or a plan to use Eureka for routing on Polaris. So maybe that's an action item.

Then BasementNodes says "All of them" in response to something, but without context, it's hard to tell. Maybe not an action item here.

saysullivan asks about what to do after Eureka on Cosmos Polaris and the difference between two concepts. This is a question, not an action item, but perhaps the answer might lead to one.

Osmosis_statbot provides a support link. Not an action item themselves, but could be a next step for users seeking help.

Wcc8311 asks about Euro LP in the future. That's a question, but the response from JohnnyWyles87 mentions they have EURe via Monerium but liquidity is bad. Then he says they've contacted them before but will again. So contacting Monerium again is an action item.

Another message from JohnnyWyles87 explains IBC Eureka as an IBC v2 connection via Cosmos Hub and mentions extra work for a deposit flow. So the action here is working on the extra hop for liquidity provision instead of other IBC v2 clients.

SoulRa1ser suggests contacting Noble to integrate EURC from Circle. That's a clear action item: contact Noble for EURC integration.

User_343756695 talks about using hubs if cheaper and Osmosis being the main choice for BTC trades. Not sure if that's an action item or just a statement.

Kychuli's messages mention getting assets added to alloy, which is an action item. Also, discussing whether Osmosis should make its own connection or use the hub, but that's more a consideration than a decision. The message "it will benefit the whole ecosystem" seems like a decision or conclusion.

User_7034835083 asks about Osmo token and how to be bullish. Not an action item unless there's a response planning to address that, but the other messages don't directly answer it.

Mathiax and mikebarb's messages are
