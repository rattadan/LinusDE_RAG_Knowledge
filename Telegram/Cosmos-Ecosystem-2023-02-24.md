## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary of the provided text, focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and one from leonoorcosmos.

First, I need to parse each tweet and identify the main information. The first tweet is about the Cosmos Weekly News highlighting several tokens like $ATOM, $TORI, etc., and mentioning some accounts they're tagging. The main point here is the promotion of the weekly news and the tokens involved.

Next, the second tweet talks about a two-year analytics report from Cosmos, which is free for #Cosmonauts. That's a key point because it's a significant report release. Then there's a tweet from leonoorcosmos mentioning BitCanna being listed in Leap Wallet, which is a non-custodial wallet for Cosmos and Terra. They also note that Leap Wallet open-sourced their Key Management code, which is important for transparency and trust.

The following tweets from combot are just eyes (üëÄ) and links, so maybe not much there except attention-grabbing. But the one about Lava's testnet is important. It includes what the testnet covers: what Lava is, how it works, supported chains, and contribution methods. The link provided is a resource for that info.

Another tweet mentions new activity in Cosmos with AssetMantle being very active recently. The last two tweets discuss the ICF delegation program, specifically the list of 93 validators who will receive delegation from ICF. This is a key decision point as it affects Cosmos Hub validators.

I need to consolidate all these points. The summary should mention the weekly news, the analytics report, BitCanna in Leap Wallet, the Lava testnet details, AssetMantle's activity, and the ICF delegation program with the list of validators. Also, note the tokens mentioned and the relevant links. Avoid the less informative tweets with just eyes. Make sure it's concise, bullet points if possible. Check for any other important details like the open-source code from Leap Wallet and the purpose of the ICF program. Alright, that should cover the main points without getting too bogged down in the repetitive tweets.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Cosmos Weekly News (Feb 24, 2023):** Highlighted tokens $ATOM, $TORI, $

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, along with some other interactions.

First, I need to go through each message and identify the key topics. The first tweet mentions "Cosmos Weekly News" and lists several cryptocurrency symbols like $ATOM, $TORI, etc. It also tags multiple accounts and has a link. The main topic here seems to be the Cosmos Weekly News and possibly the promotion of those tokens or projects.

Next, there's a tweet celebrating 2 years of Cosmos deep analytics report. So that's another topic: the 2-year analytics report.

Then, a tweet from leonoorcosmos talks about BitCanna being listed in Leap Wallet, which is a non-custodial wallet for Cosmos and Terra. They mention open-source Key Management code. Topics here would be BitCanna, Leap Wallet, and maybe open-source initiatives.

Another tweet is just eyes (üëÄ), but that's probably not a topic. The user might ignore those since they don't convey specific information.

The next part is about Lava testnet. The tweet asks questions about Lava, how it works, supported chains, and contribution methods. So the main topic here is Lava Network's testnet.

Another tweet mentions new activity in Cosmos with several projects like AssetMantle, Decentraland, Galxe, etc., and notes that AssetMantle has been active. So topics here are new activity in Cosmos and the mentioned projects.

Then there are two tweets about the ICF delegation program for Cosmos Hub validators and the list of 93 validators receiving delegation. The main topics here are ICF delegation program and Cosmos Hub validators.

Putting this all together, the main topics are:

- Cosmos Weekly News
- 2 years of Cosmos deep analytics report
- BitCanna listed in Leap Wallet
- Leap Wallet (non-custodial wallet for Cosmos & Terra)
- Open-source Key Management codebase
- Lava Network testnet
- Supported chains by Lava
- Cosmos Hub validators delegation program
- ICF delegation list (93 validators)
- New activity in Cosmos with projects (AssetMantle, Decentraland, Galxe, Cosmos ATOM Daily)
- AssetMantle's recent activity

I should check if any of these can be merged or

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through each part carefully.

The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and one from leonoorcosmos. The tweets mention various cryptocurrencies like $ATOM, $TORI, etc., and tag other Twitter accounts. They also include links and some emojis. 

Looking at the first tweet: It's promoting the Cosmos Weekly News, asking for retweets, and mentions spreading the word. The use of emojis like üî• and üó£Ô∏è suggests enthusiasm. Words like "support" and "spreading the word" indicate positive sentiment here.

Next, the second tweet talks about a report being free for Cosmonauts, with emojis showing excitement. The third tweet from leonoorcosmos is about BitCanna being listed in Leap Wallet, mentions open-source code, and uses emojis like üí° and üëõ. Positive words like "proud" and "recently made" their code open-source add to a positive tone.

The following tweets have multiple eyes (üëÄ) emojis, which usually signal something interesting or important. The other tweets provide information about Lava testnet, new activities in Cosmos, and delegation programs. These are informative but don't have explicit negative or positive words. However, the context is about updates and activities, which are generally neutral but could be seen as positive if they're highlighting progress.

I should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden negative intent. The repeated use of emojis and exclamation points seems to be for emphasis rather than negativity. The mentions of various projects and validators getting delegations are standard announcements. 

Putting it all together, the sentiment across these tweets is mostly positive. They're promoting their ecosystem, highlighting achievements, and encouraging engagement. Even the neutral informational tweets don't convey any negative emotions. So the overall sentiment is positive.
</think>

The sentiment of the provided text is **positive**.  

### Key Observations:  
1. **Promotional and Supportive Language**: Phrases like "Show your support with RT üî•," "We keep spreading the word! üó£Ô∏è," and "making us proud" indicate enthusiasm and encouragement.  
2. **Emojis and Exclamation**: Frequent use of emojis (üî•, üó£Ô∏è, üí°, üëõ, üëÄ) and exclamation marks amplifies excitement and engagement.  
3. **Highlighting Achievements**:

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text consists of several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and one from leonoorcosmos.

First, I need to go through each message one by one. Starting with the first tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem on 2023-02-24T19:08:38. It mentions the Cosmos Weekly News and asks for retweets. The main action here is to show support by retweeting. So that's an action item: retweet the tweet.

Next, the tweet from leonoorcosmos on 2023-02-24T14:19:30. They talk about BitCanna being listed in Leap Wallet and provide a link. The action here might be to check out Leap Wallet or visit the provided links. But the user specifically mentions action items, so maybe the next step is to visit the Leap Wallet website or check the BitCanna listing.

Then there are a few tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem with just üëÄ or üî• emojis. Those don't seem to have any actionable items. They might be for engagement or attention but not specific actions to take.

Another tweet on 2023-02-24T08:50:47 discusses Lava's testnet, explaining what Lava is and how to contribute. The action item here is to check the link provided for information about Lava's testnet.

On 2023-02-24T03:23:22, there's a tweet about the ICF delegation program for Cosmos Hub validators. The action here is to check the link for the list of validators who will receive delegation. That's a decision point for validators or users involved.

I should make sure not to include the emojis or hashtags unless they're part of the action. Also, the user might be interested in steps related to Cosmos ecosystem projects, so focusing on those. The retweet request, visiting Leap Wallet, checking the Lava testnet info, and reviewing the ICF delegation list are the key points. The other tweets with just emojis can be skipped as they don't have actionable steps.

Double-checking each message for any hidden steps. The BitCanna tweet mentions being available in Leap Wallet, so maybe
