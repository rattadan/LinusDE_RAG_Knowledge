## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a tweet and wants a summary of several aspects. First, I need to break down each part.

Main topics: The user is saying goodbye to Adobe's Creative Suite because they're no longer using it and are switching to other tools like Descript and Affinity Photo. The main themes are software replacement and cost concerns.

Language style: The tweet is straightforward, direct, and a bit sarcastic with "Fairwell bad software..." The tone is practical and a bit dismissive.

Legitness: The user is talking about switching to alternative software, which is legitimate. They're not promoting anything illegal, just sharing their experience. So it's legitimate.

Ecosystem: The tweet mentions Descript and Affinity Photo, which are separate from Adobe. So maybe the user is part of a different ecosystem, but not specifically promoting a project here.

Author's character: The user seems practical, value cost-effectiveness, and maybe resistant to change. They might be a professional who values efficiency. Their decision-making is based on practical needs, not trends. They might be emotionally detached, focusing on practicality.

Context: The user is transitioning away from Adobe tools, which suggests they're looking for more affordable or efficient alternatives. They might be in a field that requires video and photo editing, but they're moving to cheaper options.

Keywords: Maybe "software replacement", "cost-effective", "alternative tools", "Adobe transition", "AI integration".

Wait, the user mentioned AI has grown stronger, so maybe "AI integration" is relevant. Also, "cost-effective" is a key point. The keywords should capture the main points of the tweet. Let me check again.

Yes, the main points are switching to alternatives, cost, AI, and Adobe transition. So the keywords would be those. Make sure they're concise and match the content.
