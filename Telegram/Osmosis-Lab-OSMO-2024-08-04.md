## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different people, mostly about issues with Osmosis, Wormhole, Portal, and token transfers.

First, I need to identify the main issues. Svansy is having trouble with tokens stuck in the bridge, specifically from Solana to Osmosis. They mention it's been 12 hours and the bot isn't working properly. Kilo_WH and BasementNodes are responding, suggesting possible solutions like resuming the transaction, checking settings, or using different bridges like Portal or Osmosis. There's a mention of a misconfigured setting on threads causing problems. Also, some users are confused about the relationship between Wormhole and Portal, thinking they're the same but being told they're different teams.

Another thread is about the support system. Users are frustrated with the lack of human support in Wormhole's Discord, only bots that don't let them answer questions. Kilo_WH suggests visiting the support site, but others are skeptical. There's a request to poke the portal folks and reinstate human support.

Then there's a discussion on BTC tokens on Osmosis. Users are comparing different BTC variants (wBTC, nBTC) and their liquidity. WorkerBee_3 explains that nBTC can be withdrawn back to native BTC without KYC, and Babylon's staking. Some users are concerned about security and the need for a recovery address. There's also a proposal about Protorev using buyback and burn, which might be a decision point.

Technical issues with the Osmosis frontend are mentioned, specifically with gas fees suggesting using other tokens instead of OSMO. BasementNodes talks about a GitHub link and wanting to force OSMO as the only fee token. Svansy wants to report this as a bug.

Also, some users are discussing alternative bridges like Satellite Money and Thorchain for swaps. Devilmen76 has a question about high slippage and bridging wbnb.axl, with suggestions to send back to BNB chain.

Key points to highlight: stuck tokens in cross-chain transfers, support issues with bots, differences between Wormhole and Portal, BTC token options on Osmosis, technical frontend issues with fees, and alternative bridges. Decisions might include resuming transactions, checking bridge settings, using specific support channels, and considering nBTC for BTC interoperability.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this chat text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through the messages and figure out what the recurring themes or subjects are.

Looking at the start, there's a mention of Osmosis and Wormhole. Svansy says Osmosis doesn't have any claims, and Kilo_WH talks about Portal folks. Then there's a problem with tokens being stuck during a transfer from Solana to Osmosis. Users are frustrated with the support system, like the bot not working properly and no team in Wormhole Discord. They mention having to resume transactions and issues with the ticket system. 

There's a link to the Osmosis support site, and discussions about Wormhole and Portal being different entities. The user kychuli seems confused about whether they're the same team. Then there's a part about BTC and its various representations on different chains like wBTC and nBTC. They talk about the safety of using decentralized vs. centralized services, and the advantages of each. WorkerBee_3 explains how nBTC works with Nomic and Babylon for staking. 

Also, there's a proposal mentioned regarding Protorev for buyback and burn. Some users are having trouble with high slippage when swapping tokens, and others are discussing the need for a recovery address with Nomic. The conversation touches on using different bridges like Satellite Money and Squid Router, and issues with those. 

Technical issues with the monitoring API throwing 403 errors, ad blockers causing problems, and the need to try different bridges or pages come up. There's a lot of frustration about the support system being automated with bots and lack of human assistance. The mention of a kill switch in Nomic and returning BTC if validators go offline is another point. 

They also talk about fee tokens in Osmosis suggesting other tokens instead of OSMO, and the annoyance of that. Some users are trying to figure out the best way to bridge tokens with low slippage, and others are discussing the user experience and design choices for fee tokens. 

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be: Osmosis support issues, Wormhole vs Portalbridge, token transfer problems (specifically stuck BTC), decentralized vs centralized services, BTC on different chains (wBTC, nBTC), Nomic protocol and its features, Babylon staking, high slippage

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages and wants to know if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I need to go through each message and see the tone. The majority of the messages are from users discussing issues with Osmosis and Wormhole bridges. They mention tokens getting stuck, long wait times, bots not working properly, and frustrations with the support systems. Words like "stuck," "doesn't work," "sucks," and "annoying" are pretty negative.

Looking at specific examples: Svansy says "wen will this work pls. my tokens been stuck since 14-16h now" which clearly shows impatience and frustration. Another message from Svansy compares using the bridge to "depositing tokens into bit t-rex," which is a humorous but negative analogy. The user also mentions the Wormhole Discord being full of bots spamming fake conversations, indicating dissatisfaction.

There are some neutral or slightly positive parts, like when Kilo_WH says "‚ù§Ô∏è backpack fwiw" or when WorkerBee_3 explains how nBTC works. But these are few and far between. Most of the content is complaints about technical issues, poor support, and the need to resume transactions. Even the support bot messages are just directing users to help sites without resolving the issues.

The conversation also includes users pointing out that Osmosis is too big to change, which might be a neutral observation, but the context is frustration that nothing is improving. BasementNodes mentions a misconfigured setting causing problems, which adds to the negative sentiment.

Overall, the recurring themes are problems with the bridges, stuck transactions, unhelpful bots, and lack of human support. Even when there's a positive note, it's overshadowed by the numerous complaints. So, the sentiment here is definitely negative.

The sentiment of the provided text is **negative**. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Frustration with Services**: Multiple users (e.g., Svansy, kychuli) express dissatisfaction with Wormhole, Osmosis, and Portal bridges, citing issues like stuck tokens, long delays ("12h now"), and malfunctioning bots ("the bot wasnt working ser ü§≠").
2. **Criticism of Support Systems**: Complaints about unresponsive or automated support ("wormhole discord has no team," "ticket system

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's anything that needs to be done, a decision made, or a step to follow up.

Starting from the top, Svansy mentions Osmosis doesn't have any claims. Not sure if that's an action. Then Kilo_WH says they can't help but will poke the portal folks. So maybe an action item here: Kilo_WH to contact portal team. Also, "resume the tx" is mentioned, which might be a next step for Svansy.

Svansy is still waiting for tokens. The next message from Kilo_WH says it's a misconfigured setting on threads, now fixed. So decision made: fix the setting. But maybe next steps for Svansy would be to check again or try resuming the transaction.

Osmosis_statbot links to support site, which is standard. Kychuli is asking about Wormhole apps, and Kilo_WH provides a link. Not sure if action item here. Svansy compares depositing tokens to Bit T-Rex, which is a complaint but not an action.

Svansy's tokens stuck since 14-16h. Kilo_WH mentions the bot wasn't working properly, so maybe the next step is for Svansy to try again or for the team to fix the bot. Also, Kilo_WH shares a link to Wormhole ecosystem, but that's info, not an action.

Other messages discuss issues with Discord, support being offloaded to Portal, and some technical problems with bridging. BasementNodes suggests trying Portalbridge or Osmosis page. So possible action: Svansy to use Portalbridge or Osmosis UI.

WorkerBee_3 talks about Nomic and Babylon staking. Luisvae is trying to swap to native BTC. WorkerBee_3 provides links to Nomic app and Thorchain. So next steps: Luisvae to use those links.

Mathiax asks about BTC to ATOM swaps. WorkerBee_3 suggests using nBTC or wBTC. So action: check liquidity and proceed with swaps.

Devilmen76 has a question about bridging wbnb.axl with high slippage. GPKwee and Svansy suggest sending back to BNB chain
