## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the key points and decisions. The conversation seems to involve several users discussing cryptocurrency projects like Cosmos, TON, Jackal, Akash, and others. There's mention of a wallet on Telegram and a collective for $CULT members. I should note the important dates, like the submission deadline for $OSMO wallets on March 27th.

Then there's a lot of opinions about different blockchains and their ecosystems. Some users are critical of Cosmos for funding too many DEXs instead of more useful apps. Others talk about the importance of real revenue and use cases, like storage and compute services. There's a poll invitation from SuperEra asking people to vote for contributors, and Tzouzepe13 is encouraging others to vote for SuperEra.

Also, user_5941115938 made a purchase and mentioned being pissed about Solana deleting an ad. There's a bit of discussion about Bitcoin vs. altcoins, with some users suggesting BTC is better long-term. SithLordx compares Akash's situation to Amazon during the dot com bubble, focusing on fundamentals over token price.

I need to make sure to highlight the main decisions: the wallet submission deadline, the poll for Cosmos contributors, the criticism of Cosmos funding priorities, and the emphasis on real-world use cases. Also, note the muting of a user for discussing politics. Keep it concise, avoiding minor details and focusing on the core messages and actions.

   - Cosmotick and BasementNodes discussed Cosmos growth but noted restrictions (e.g., blockchain apps on Telegram only allowed if using TON network).  

3. **Poll & Community Support**:

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as comma-separated values. First, I need to understand the context of the text. It looks like a chat log with various users discussing cryptocurrency-related topics.

Looking at the messages, several keywords and phrases stand out. There's mention of specific cryptocurrencies like TON (Telegram Open Network), Cosmos, Osmosis, $CULT, $OSMO, $BERA, Jackal, Akash, Solana, Filecoin, Render, and Deping. These are all blockchain projects or tokens, so they should be considered as main topics.

Other recurring themes include wallet submissions, airdrops, voting for contributors, and community engagement. For example, SuperEra is asking people to submit their $OSMO wallets for a $CULT drop, and there's a poll mentioned where users are encouraged to vote. These actions‚Äîwallet submissions, airdrops, voting‚Äîare processes or events related to these projects, so they might be topics too.

There's also discussion about blockchain networks and their ecosystems. Users talk about using other networks only for bridging to TON, Cosmos's growth, and Jackal expanding to Base. The mention of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) in "Puuf_DeFi" and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) in SithLordx's message about Jackal, Akash, Filecoin, etc., indicates these are areas of focus.

Technical aspects like GPU compute, storage, and liquidity in the crypto market come up. SithLordx emphasizes real revenue and use cases, criticizing the funding of unnecessary DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) over practical applications. These points relate to the functionality and sustainability of blockchain projects.

Additionally, there's a mention of a user being muted for discussing politics, which might not be a main topic but more of a moderation note. However, the phrase "politics is for nerds" could indicate a stance or a community rule, so maybe "community governance" or "moderation policies" could be topics here, but I'm not sure if that's central enough.

Some messages express opinions on token prices, accumulation strategies, and comparisons between BTC maxis and altcoins. These relate to investment strategies and market analysis. Terms like "alpha" (referring to insider information or insights) and "100x" (significant returns) are

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

First, looking at the positive comments: There's "Bought some today thanks man" and "Absolute fire" from user_5941115938, which seem positive. Then cosmotick says "I love only atom and atom friendly," which is positive towards Atom. There's also support for SuperEra with messages like "Vote for super era" and "you are the best," indicating positive sentiment towards that project. Some other messages mention projects like Jackal, Akash, and BERA, which might be neutral or positive depending on context.

Now, the negative parts: The user mentions "I am quite pissed solana deleted the ad tho" which is clearly negative. Another message says "Fucking pussies," which is a strong negative term. SithLordx has several critical comments about the Cosmos ecosystem, like "This is why i shit on the cosmos ecosystem" and "most alts do nothing and should be worth 0 imo." Those are pretty harsh negatives. Also, "Shhh... quiet now. Muted..." with a reason "politics is for nerds" might indicate some frustration or moderation, but maybe neutral unless the user is upset.

Neutral parts: Discussions about technical aspects like using other networks for bridging funds to TON, mentions of projects like Deping, and instructions on how to claim airdrops. These seem informational without strong positive or negative emotions.

I should check if there's any sarcasm or mixed emotions. For example, "Dont worry üëÄ" could be ambiguous, but without more context, it might lean neutral. The user talking about dumping their holdings ("I should probably dump it") shows a negative sentiment towards their own investment, but the response "Should of a long time ago mate" could be neutral advice.

Putting it all together: There are both positive and negative sentiments. The positive ones are about specific projects and support. The negative ones are criticisms of certain ecosystems and strong language. The neutral parts are factual or procedural. Since there are multiple strong negative comments from SithLordx and user_5941115938, along with some positive ones, but also a lot of neutral discussion, the overall sentiment might be mixed. However, the task is to choose between positive,

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat. The user wants me to go through each message and identify any tasks, decisions made, or next steps that people are talking about. Let me start by reading through each line carefully.

First, user_5941115938 at 22:51:48 says "Bought some today thanks man" and another message at 22:51:40 says "Absolute fire". These seem like positive reactions but not specific actions. Maybe "Bought some today" is an action item indicating they purchased something, but I need to check context. The previous message from cosmotick at 22:34:24 mentions removing something if the user is right, but it's unclear. Then cosmotick at 22:31:53 is asking about needing Telegram on Cosmos or social media. BasementNodes at 22:28:29 says they can only use other networks to bridge funds to TON. Itsmeartc at 22:28:11 suggests maybe they're using two networks. BasementNodes at 22:27:35 warns about getting nuked if using blockchain apps on Telegram except TON. Itsmeartc at 22:03:55 says "Dont worry üëÄ" and at 22:03:39 tells cosmotick to post a link. Cosmotick at 22:03:19 is hesitant to post a link due to admin banning. Itsmeartc at 22:01:51 asks about Jeet wallet. Cosmotick at 21:39:46 compliments BasementNodes' wallet on Telegram. Earlier, Tzouzepe13 is urging people to vote for SuperEra and mentions sharing with a Greek community. SuperEra posts links to Twitter for wallet submissions for a token drop, closing on March 27th. There's also a mention of a BERA airdrop registration closing on March 24th. Rattadan talks about acquiring users from the broader crypto space. SithLordx discusses funding issues in the Cosmos ecosystem, preferring projects with real use cases like DePIN. Lostreply mentions muting someone for discussing politics. User_
