## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the given tweets/messages and provide a summary with specific points. They also want five keywords/tags for postprocessing. 

First, I need to understand the main topics. Looking at the tweets, the user is talking about the Cosmos ecosystem, NFTs, wallets, and cryptocurrencies like $ATOM and $BTC. There's a lot of mention of needing a native wallet for cross-chain NFTs, and they're talking about projects like Osmosis and others. They also mention financial aspects like price movements and valuations.

Next, the language style and tone. The user uses phrases like "It doesn't seem that hard guys," which is casual and positive. They use emojis like ðŸš€ and ðŸ“ˆ for emphasis, which adds a lively tone. The tone is enthusiastic about the Cosmos ecosystem and the potential of the projects.

The key points are the Cosmos ecosystem, cross-chain NFTs, native wallets, cryptocurrency price movements, and community engagement. The user is excited about the future of these projects and the market.

For the keywords/tags, I should pick the most relevant ones. Maybe something like "Cosmos Ecosystem," "Cross-Chain NFTs," "Cryptocurrency Valuation," "Market Trends," and "Community Engagement." These tags capture the main themes from the tweets.

I need to make sure the response is concise and focused. The user wants the most distinctive patterns, so I'll highlight the key areas without going into too much detail. The keywords should be specific and relevant to the content.
