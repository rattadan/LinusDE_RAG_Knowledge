### Document Overview  
This document outlines the vision of the Optimism Collective, focusing on collaborative projects like BasePaint, the Synthetix lending platform, and the Superchain protocol. It emphasizes decentralized governance, open-source development, and the goal of creating an equitable internet powered by the Superchain.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **BasePaint**: A collaborative pixel art app enabling peer-to-peer creation.  
- **Synthetix**: A decentralized lending platform for synthetic assets, built on OP Mainnet.  
- **Superchain**: A modular, interoperable protocol for blockchain ecosystems, built on OP Mainnet and Fraxtal.  
- **Modular Consensus**: Scalable, flexible consensus systems for decentralized networks.  
- **Retro Funding**: A mechanism to reward public goods and sustain decentralized networks.  
- **Open Source**: The protocol is fully open-source, forked by over 40 chains, and maintained with minimal code changes.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Superchain Architecture**: Modular, scalable, and interoperable, with support for multiple blockchain stacks.  
- **Codebase**: Under 1,000 lines of code, clean, safe, and highly interoperable.  
- **Funding Model**: Retro Funding incentivizes public goods through token-based rewards.  
- **Deployment**: Built on OP Mainnet (for compatibility) and Fraxtal (for flexibility).  
- **Collaborative Development**: Core developers contribute to protocol development, emphasizing community governance.  

### Related Topics  
- **Superchain Dev Docs**: Links to technical details of the Superchain protocol.  
- **Govern & Delegate**: References to decentralized governance frameworks.  
- **Optimism Collective**: The broader vision of an equitable, decentralized internet.  
- **BasePaint & Synthetix**: Highlighted as key projects under the Optimism Collectiveâ€™s collaborative mission.

Own and grow with your onchain fren.

An open source protocol created to help give everyone access to the global economy.

Built on OP Mainnet

The open-source engine behind the Superchain: modular, scalable, highly interoperable, and built for blockchains of all kinds.

Always open source, and proudly forked by over 40 chains its in our DNA.

Less than 1k lines of code diff from L1 geth. The cleanest, safest, scaling solution.

Core developers collaborate and contribute to protocol development. If you want to go far, go together.

Modular consensus, execution, and proof systems. Multiple alternative stacks, with innovation on all fronts.

The traditional web has inherited exploitative economic rulesets that limit power and influence in the hands of the few. The Optimism Collective aims to create a new internet that benefits all and is owned by all.

This internet will be sustained by rewarding public goods through Retro Funding.

The Optimism Collective is a new model of digital democratic governance.
