I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the technical details, parameters, or processes described in Table 3 of a document related to ride-hailing systems.

**Exact Technical Details:**

* Service rates: These refer to the number of requests for parking (N) and match missed requests (MMR) per unit time.
* Waiting times:
	+ N: 0.00 seconds
	+ MMR: 0.00 seconds
	+ Iterative zone balance: 43.77 seconds
* Additional costs:
	+ N: 0.00 km driven, 0.00 km served without customers per second of reduced average waiting time
	+ MMR: -3.76 km driven, 15.61 km served without customers per second of reduced average waiting time

**How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:**

This chunk is connected to the surrounding context through Table 4, which presents additional costs associated with different services and strategies in a ride-hailing system.

The technical details described in this chunk build upon previous references discussed in the text chunk. For example, the table describes service rates and waiting times for specific services (N and MMR), similar to what was previously discussed. The additional costs section is also related to these previous topics.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The following requirements are implied:

* There is an interest in ride-hailing systems, as evidenced by the references provided.
* The system has different fleet sizes, which suggests that the topic of dynamic dispatch and repositioning may be relevant.
* Dynamic dispatch and rebalancing strategies are mentioned in previous references, implying that this topic is also important.
* Simulation platforms like DIMACS Center for Discrete Mathematics are used to analyze ride-hailing systems, suggesting a focus on computational methods.
* The references provided indicate a need for accurate and up-to-date information about ride-hailing systems.
