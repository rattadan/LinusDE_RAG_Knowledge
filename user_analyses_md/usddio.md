Putting these tweets in the context of intentions:
The account @usddio is clearly promoting the USDD stablecoin, focusing on the benefits of minting USDD with TRX/sTRX/USDT as collateral. The tweets serve multiple purposes: they're marketing materials to attract new users with favorable rates, they're educational content explaining how USDD works and its use cases, and they're engagement tools to create active participation from the audience by asking for responses.
