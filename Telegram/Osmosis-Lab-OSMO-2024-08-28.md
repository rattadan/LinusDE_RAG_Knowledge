## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages.

First, I'll scan through the text to identify the main topics. There's a lot about Osmosis (OSMO) token supply and inflation. Mikebarb and Tyrolius are discussing whether OSMO is inflationary or deflationary. There's a proposal to halve the inflation, changing the max supply from 1 billion to around 714 million. That's a key point. They also mention a link to the forum discussion.

Then, there's a question about the best DEX wallet for OSMO. Mikebarb recommends Keplr or Leap. So that's another key point.

Volume and trading issues come up. Users noticed high volume on the DEX, and there's a mention of a temporary glitch with the swap button being grayed out. Mikebarb suggests using buy/sell instead of swap and mentions the slippage setting is under the transaction confirmation. Also, a user reports that Axelar is upgrading, causing Squidrouter to be in maintenance.

Technical discussions about limit orders: jasbanza asks about availability for all pairs, and mikebarb says there's no timeline yet. Another user mentions a slow reaction since a frontend update, possibly related to a pixel game analogy.

Other stuff includes a link to a revenue share proposal with Shade Protocol and some off-topic banter about a pixel game and airdrops.

I need to structure the summary around these topics, highlighting decisions and key info. Make sure to mention the inflation proposal, wallet recommendations, volume reasons, technical issues with the UI, limit orders status, and the Axelar upgrade. Also, note the unrelated banter but maybe keep it brief unless it's a decision. Avoid the noise like the pixel game unless it's part of a key point. Check for any other important links or specific numbers mentioned, like the max supply changes and the links provided.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **OSMO Token Supply/Inflation**:  
   - Osmosis (OSMO) was initially inflationary with a max supply cap of **1 billion**, but a governance proposal (Proposal #833) aims to reduce this cap to **~714 million** by halving inflation.  
   - Current circulating supply is disputed (some claim ~2.3

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string.

First, I'll go through each message to identify the key subjects. Starting with the earliest messages:

- phildeez7 and mikebarb are discussing issues with the swap button being grayed out and the location of the slippage setting. That's about the UI/UX problem in the new update.

- Then, there's a mention of Axelar's upgrade and Squidrouter maintenance. That's a network or service update affecting Osmosis.

- Tyrolius and mikebarb talk about Osmo's max supply, inflation, and a proposal to halve inflation. This relates to tokenomics and governance proposals.

- The user jz_crom asks about high volume on the DEX, and others discuss volume accuracy discrepancies. So, topics here are DEX trading volume and possible inaccuracies.

- There's a mention of a new feature link from David J. Goosey, which might be about upcoming features in Osmosis.

- The osmogovbot messages refer to governance proposals like the Shade Protocol Revenue Share and Top of Block Auction revenue use. These are governance-related topics.

- BasementNodes and Svansy discuss a pixel game and slow UI response post-update. The slow UI is another UX issue, and the pixel game might be a separate topic or a reference to another project.

- The links to Coingecko, Mintscan, and the Osmosis forum are resources but not topics themselves. However, they relate to checking exchange data, asset information, and governance discussions.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be:

1. Osmosis UI/UX issues (swap button, slippage settings, slow response)
2. Osmo tokenomics (inflation, max supply, halving proposal)
3. Governance proposals (Shade Protocol, Top of Block Auction revenue)
4. DEX trading volume discrepancies
5. Network upgrades (Axelar upgrade affecting Squidrouter)
6. Limit orders functionality (availability on certain chains)
7. Possible bugs or glitches affecting trading
8. Pixel game reference (maybe related to airdrops or another project)

I need to ensure these topics are distinct and not overlapping. For example, the UI/UX problems are mentioned in different messages, so they should be grouped. The tokenomics

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from a channel discussing Osmosis (OSMO) tokens and related topics. I need to go through each message and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first message: "I personally like keplr or leap" ‚Äì that's a positive statement because of "like". Next, someone asks about the best Dex Wallet for OSMO. Neutral since it's a question without emotion.

Then, "This seems more accurate" refers to a link. Neutral as it's just confirming accuracy. The next message is a link, so neutral. 

"Where its possible to see the number of osmo holders and % of holdings?" ‚Äì another question, neutral. 

"I don't believe 2.4b is accurate" ‚Äì negative because of doubt. "I Saw a big movement of 2.4B" ‚Äì neutral, just stating a fact. "Im here at chat because those numbers" ‚Äì neutral, explaining presence. 

"Why? I'm speaking about the all chain" ‚Äì neutral, seeking explanation. "Unless this passes and then it will inflate to 714 million and max cap is 714 million" ‚Äì discussing a proposal, neutral. "So 1B its max" ‚Äì neutral. "Inflation was set at 1B since creation" ‚Äì neutral. 

"But the community wants to inflate it? Is just to understand..." ‚Äì neutral, asking for clarification. "Sorry 714 million" ‚Äì correction, neutral. "It was to be capped at 1b after fully inflated but a proposal is up to lower it..." ‚Äì neutral info. 

"But max supply was not capped at 1b?" ‚Äì question, neutral. "These are some of the new features" ‚Äì neutral. "I noticed that volume on Dex has increased a lot, any special feature coming?" ‚Äì neutral. "Let me get a link..." ‚Äì neutral. 

"Im reading now about Osmosis" ‚Äì neutral. "https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/833" ‚Äì link, neutral. "Currently it's inflationary. Max supply was 1b but there's a prop..." ‚Äì neutral info. 

"Which is the max supply?" ‚Äì question, neutral. "Osmo token is inflacionary? Or deflacionary?" ‚Äì neutral.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll need to go through each message carefully and identify any parts that indicate a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a step that follows.

Starting from the top, the first few messages are about wallets and DEX. Tyrolius asks which is the best Dex Wallet for OSMO, and Mikebarb mentions Keplr or Leap. That's a recommendation, but is it an action item? Maybe not directly, but the user might want to note that as a decision. Then there's a discussion about the max supply of OSMO. Mikebarb says it's inflationary with a max supply of 1B, but there's a proposal to lower it to 770 million. So the action here is that there's a proposal in progress, and maybe someone needs to check the forum link he provided.

Next, Tyrolius notices increased volume on the DEX and asks about new features. Mikebarb shares a link to new features, which could be an action item to review or share those features. Then there's a mention of a high volume day for Osmosis, and someone asks why. Another user mentions Axelar's upgrade and Squidrouter maintenance, which might be a reason but not an action item.

Looking further down, there's a problem with the swap button being grayed out and users struggling to find the slippage setting. Mikebarb suggests trying buy/sell instead of swap and mentions a glitch, so the action items here could be for the user to check the support site or report the issue. Also, the devs were informed, so maybe a follow-up is needed.

Then there's a proposal from Shade Protocol and Secret Network about the Fee Abstraction Module. The OsmoGovBot posts a link to the forum discussion. That's a decision point for governance, so stakeholders should review and participate in the discussion.

Another part is about the limit orders only being available for certain chains. Mikebarb says they don't know the timeline for expanding them, so the next step might be for the team to address that or for users to stay updated.

Also, there's an issue with the UI being slow after a font update, which might require checking the support site or contacting support. The user Svansy is having trouble with
