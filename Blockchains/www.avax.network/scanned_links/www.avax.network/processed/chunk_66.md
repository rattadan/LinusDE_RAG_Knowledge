## Source Context
*From: https://www.avax.network/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses the Codebase program for Ava Labs, emphasizing the importance of understanding Avalanche's ecosystem, interoperability, and technical support to build successful applications.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Avalanche ecosystem**: Interoperable blockchains enabling cross-chain communication.  
- **Avalanche 9000**: Vision for a decentralized, interoperable network.  
- **Codebase program**: Training initiative for developers to build applications on Avalanche.  
- **Interoperability**: Ability of blockchains to communicate and share data.  
- **Technical support**: Provided by Ava Labs and partners like AvaCloud.  
- **Domain expertise**: Understanding the specific needs of the application and its target audience.  
- **Go-to-market strategies**: Leveraging Avalanche’s ecosystem to create new business models.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Technical expertise not required**: Founders can join without prior experience but need to demonstrate understanding of Avalanche’s ecosystem.  
- **Focus on "why"**: Applicants must explain how Avalanche’s unique features (e.g., interoperability, consensus mechanisms) unlock value for their application.  
- **AvaCloud partnership**: Ava Labs collaborates with AvaCloud to provide technical support for applicants.  
- **Avalanche 9000**: The broader vision of the network, emphasizing decentralized and interoperable capabilities.  

### Related Topics  
- **Codebase program documentation**: The content aligns with the broader documentation on the Codebase initiative and its goals.  
- **Avalanche ecosystem features**: References to interoperability and consensus mechanisms are connected to other technical guides on the Avalanche network.

are necessary, but the lessons from our first two Codebasecohortshave shown that theyâre not sufficient.Â

The founders who are successful in Codebase must also understand the unique unlocks of building in the Avalanche ecosystem, have a clear line of sight to their potential customers, astrong relationshipwith their founding team, and sufficient domain expertise to build their application.Â

As Ava Labspreparesfor its third Codebase cohort, weâve assembled this short guide to help founders prepare for the program and set themselves up for success.Â

For Michael Martin, the Codebase program director at Ava Labs, one of the most important ways for founders to prepare for the program is to cultivate a solid understanding of not just why their application needs to be on chain, but why it needs to be built in the Avalanche ecosystem in particular.Â Â

This means demonstrating an understanding of how Avalanche's ecosystem of interoperable blockchains enables new business models and go-to-market strategies. Simply having a blockchain-based idea isn't enoughâsuccessful applicants need to show how Avalanche's specific capabilities unlock unique value for their users.

"It's less important to understand everything about how Avalanche works,â says Martin. âIt's more important for founders to understand how Avalanche could work for them and their idea.â

While founders should understand the basics ofAvalanche's consensus mechanismand the broader vision ofAvalanche9000, deep technical expertise or experience building on Avalanche isn't a prerequisite. The program provides comprehensive technical support through its relationship with Ava Labs' engineering teams and key ecosystem partners likeAvaCloud. What's crucial is understanding how Avalanche could work for your specific idea and business model.Â

âAvalanche is an ecosystem of blockchains that are now interoperable,â says Martin.
