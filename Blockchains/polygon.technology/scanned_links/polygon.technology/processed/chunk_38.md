## Source Context
*From: https://polygon.technology/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses Privado ID, a verifiable credential system built on Polygon’s EVM-compatible chains, emphasizing its W3C standards, cost structure, open-source nature, and support for enterprise use cases.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Digital identifiers that can be authenticated and verified, implemented via the W3C standard in Privado ID.  
- **W3C Standards**: The foundation for Privado ID’s credential system, ensuring interoperability and adoption in the enterprise sector.  
- **EVM-Compatible Chains**: Blockchain platforms (e.g., Polygon Testnet, PoS Mainnet) where Privado ID’s smart contracts are deployed.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated protocols for managing credentials, fees, and user data.  
- **Fee Structure**: Charges for credential reuse, one-time fees for cloud wallet services, and potential revenue from infrastructure/services.  
- **Open-Source**: Privado ID is free to use but plans to monetize additional services.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Deployment**: Smart contracts are currently on Polygon Testnet (Amoy) and PoS Mainnet but could be migrated to any EVM-compatible chain.  
- **Fee Models**: Verifiers (e.g., applications) pay fees for credential reuse, while Privado ID collects a percentage of transactions.  
- **Cloud Wallet**: A one-time fee per user onboarded covers storage and key custody services.  
- **Enterprise Support**: Tailored services for private infrastructure (e.g., government or corporate systems).  

### Related Topics

and is not stored on the blockchain, there are no minting or transfer costs as with NFTs. For more details about the costs of running Privado ID, see the question âWhat is the cost of Privado ID?â.-Standards: VCs are globally recognized for their adherence to W3C standards, widely embraced in the enterprise sector compared to the more specialized adoption of NFTs and SBTs within Web3.âVerifiable credentials, the W3C standard implemented in Privado ID, are the most practical technology to digitize our identities and finally allow people to prove who they are on the internet. The challenge is user adoption, and Privado ID is leading the way in the Web3 space.Join the ecosystemof projects already implementing Privado ID!

Privado ID can run on any EVM-compatible chain. At the moment, the necessary smart contracts are deployed onto Polygon Testnet (Amoy) and Polygon PoS Mainnet, but they could be deployed into any other EVM-compatible chain including any CDK-based blockchain very soon.

Privado ID is an open-source software and is free to use. However, Privado ID plans to generate revenue by offering additional infrastructure and services.

This structure allows Privado ID to support a wide range of use cases while maintaining its foundational open-source principles

- Credentials: Fees are charged for the use and reuse of credentials. Verifiers (e.g., Applications) will pay these fees to the issuers via a payment rails infrastructure, and Privado ID will collect a percentage of each transaction.
- Identity Cloud Wallet:Privado ID might charge charge a one-time fee to the verifier (e.g., Application) for each new user onboarded. This fee covers necessary services for the cloud wallet, such as storage and key custody.
- Enterprise Support:Privado ID provides tailored support and development services for systems requiring private infrastructure, such as those operated by governments or corporations.
