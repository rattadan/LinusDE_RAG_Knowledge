## 📝 AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to go through each message and identify what's important.

Starting with faneatiku's message at 17:58:53. They mention a Twitter poll and provide a link. The key point here is the poll, so I should note that there's a poll to vote on. The link is probably to the poll, so I'll include that.

Next, rcjulin_ForkDAO says "Hi All the cosmos" with some emojis. That's just a greeting, not much to summarize here. Maybe mention the greeting but it's not a key decision or point.

Antropocosmist talks about the ATOM Hacker House in 7 days with 20 speakers and a packed agenda. There's a link to an event page. So the main points are the event details: date (7 days to go), number of speakers, and the event page link. Also, the user might want to highlight the event as important.

Then there's two messages from wlkatja with links to Warden Protocol tweets. These seem like they're just sharing external content, no specific decisions or key points from the text itself. So maybe just note that they shared these links but not much else.

SparcoGx has an AMA Part 1 blog post about Planq Network. They mention transparency, community questions about $PLQ, Delta Swap, Castrum. The blog link is provided. The key here is the AMA session and the topics covered. Also, they want people to like and share the tweet, but that's more of an action item for promotion.

adr868 gives more details about the ATOM Hacker House, listing speakers and the event page. This reinforces the event's importance with a lineup and agenda. The Notion link is another resource for the event. So this adds to the previous info about the Hacker House.

SparcoGx's GM message is a motivational post for Planqonauts, wishing a productive week. Not a key decision, just a community update.

Asa332 shares a link to Cosmos Ecosystem's tweet, but again, without the content of that tweet, it's just a reference. Then they mention the $ELYS airdrop snapshot on November 29 at 6:30 PM UTC

## 🔍 Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify what they're talking about.

Starting with faneatiku's message, they mention a Twitter poll. The URL is there, but the main topic here is the poll itself. So I'll note "Twitter poll" as one topic.

Next, rcjulin_ForkDAO says "Hi All the cosmos 🌐🧉👌💡". The word "cosmos" here might refer to the Cosmos ecosystem or network, given the context of other messages. The emoji includes a globe and some symbols, but the key term is "cosmos," so that's another topic.

Then Antropocosmist talks about the ATOM Hacker House in 7 days with 20 speakers and a packed agenda. ATOM is the native token of the Cosmos Hub, so this is related to the Cosmos ecosystem. The main topics here are "ATOM Hacker House" and "Barcelona hackathon" since the event is in Barcelona as mentioned later by adr868.

Looking at wlkatja's two messages, both are URLs pointing to Warden Protocol tweets. Warden Protocol is a Cosmos-based project, so "Warden Protocol" should be included. The URLs are specific tweets, but the main topic is the protocol itself.

SparcoGx has a message about a Planq Network AMA (Ask Me Anything) and mentions $PLQ, Delta Swap, Castrum. The AMA is part of Planq Network's activities, so "Planq Network AMA" and "Delta Swap" are topics. They also mention "Castrum," which might be a project or product related to Planq.

adr868's message expands on the ATOM Hacker House, specifying it's in Barcelona with a list of speakers and an event page. So "Barcelona hackathon" is already covered, but also "CosmWasm," "Neutron," "Injective," "Abstract," "Binary Builders," "Polygon," "AADAO," "Hacken," "CryptoVista," "Youbi Capital," "Poshuman," "3x Capital," "Octoplace," "dRPC," "Juno," "Seedify" – these are all projects or companies represented by the speakers. However, the user asked for main topics, so maybe just

## 😊 Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of the given text. Let me start by reading through each message carefully. 

First message from faneatiku: They're mentioning a Twitter poll and providing a link. The text is "Let's see some votes on this twitter poll." That sounds neutral. They're just inviting people to vote, not expressing a strong positive or negative emotion.

Next, rcjulin_ForkDAO says "Hi All the cosmos 🌐🧉👌💡". The greeting is friendly, and the emojis are positive. Cosmos is probably referring to the blockchain project, so this is a positive message showing enthusiasm.

Antropocosmist talks about the ATOM Hacker House with 7 days to go, using 🥁 emojis and mentioning 20 speakers and a packed agenda. Definitely positive and excited about the upcoming event.

wlkatja has two messages, both just sharing links. No text except the URLs. Since there's no explicit sentiment expressed, those should be neutral.

SparcoGx's message starts with "Planq Network AMA - Part 1" and mentions transparency being key to trust. Then they talk about addressing challenges and shaping the future. The words like "transparency," "progress," and "future" are positive. Also, the emojis like 🗝 and 📲 might add a positive tone. The next message from SparcoGx is "GM Planqonauts 🌟 New day, new chance to chase our dreams..." with emojis and encouraging words. Definitely positive here as well.

adr868 lists speakers for the ATOM Hacker House event, mentions 7 days left, and provides links. The use of emojis 🥁 and the excitement about the event lineup makes this positive. They're promoting the event, so positive sentiment.

Asa332 shares a link and then mentions the $ELYS airdrop snapshot date. The airdrop info is factual but usually airdrops are seen as positive by the community because they can be beneficial. However, just stating the date might be neutral unless there's an emotional cue. Since it's a straightforward announcement, maybe neutral. But sometimes airdrops are exciting, so could be positive. Hmm, need to decide. The first Asa332 message is a link, neutral. The second is the airdrop snapshot, which is positive because it's an announcement of an event that holders would be interested

## ✅ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully.

Starting with faneatiku's message at 17:58: They're asking the community to vote on a Twitter poll. The link is provided, so the action item here is to participate in the poll. That's straightforward.

Next, rcjulin_ForkDAO's message at 16:02: It's a greeting with some emojis. No action needed here, just a hello. So nothing to extract.

Antropocosmist at 15:12: Talks about the ATOM Hacker House event in 7 days, mentioning speakers and agenda. The link is to a Twitter post. The next step here might be to check the event details or attend it. But since the user is looking for explicit actions, maybe just noting the event reminder and the link.

wlkatja has two messages, both sharing Twitter links. They don't include specific actions beyond sharing, so unless there's a call to action in the message, which there isn't, those might not contribute anything.

SparcoGx at 13:30: This is about a Planq Network AMA Part 1. They mention transparency and link a blog and a tweet to like/share. The action items here are to read the blog and engage with the tweet by liking and sharing. So that's two actions.

adr868 at 12:52: Announces the ATOM Hacker House & Hackathon in Barcelona in 7 days. Lists speakers and provides links to a thread and event page. The next steps here are to check the event page for details and participate in the event. Since the event is in 7 days, the user might need to register or prepare. But the message itself doesn't say "register now" or anything, just the announcement. However, the links are actionable.

SparcoGx at 12:13: Another message with a good morning, no specific action items, just motivational.

Asa332 at 6:40 and 4:07: Both share links, but the second one mentions the $ELYS airdrop snapshot on November 29 at 6:30 PM UTC. Here, the action item is for NFT holders
