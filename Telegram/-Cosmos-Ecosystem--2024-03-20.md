## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary request. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I need to go through the text and identify the main interactions.

Starting with VladimirSmirnov1995 asking how to start learning about the Cosmos ecosystem. Asa332 responds by suggesting the Cosmos Zealy campaign link. Then Vladimir thanks them. There's some back and forth about deleted messages between Asa332 and Arman_231. Arman apologizes for deleting messages, mentions there are a lot of scams. Asa332 says it's okay and mentions applying scam prevention. Also, Asa332 shares the Zealy link again.

Key points: Vladimir's question, Asa332's recommendation of Zealy campaign, Arman deleting messages and the apology, mention of scam prevention. Decisions here might be Asa332's choice to share the link again and the application of scam prevention measures. Also, Arman acknowledging his mistake.

I need to make sure the summary includes the main question, the recommendation, the deletion issue with the apology, and the scam prevention. Keep it concise, so avoid redundant details. Maybe structure it as: Vladimir asks about starting to learn Cosmos. Asa332 suggests Zealy link. Arman deletes messages, apologizes, cites scams. Asa332 accepts apology, reiterates Zealy link and scam prevention.

Check for clarity and that all main points are covered without extra info. Use proper grammar and flow.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. The text consists of several chat messages with timestamps and usernames. Each message is separated by a line with three dashes. The content includes discussions about the Cosmos ecosystem, Zealy campaigns, scam prevention, and some apologies for deleting messages.

Looking at the messages, the first one from Asa332 mentions "Cosmos ecosystem Zealy campaign" and a link. Then another message from Asa332 talks about starting with the Zealy campaign link. VladimirSmirnov1995 asks how to start learning about the Cosmos ecosystem. Asa332 responds by suggesting the Zealy campaign again. There's an apology from Arman_231 about deleting messages, and Asa332 mentions scam prevention. Another message from Arman_231 says they deleted messages because of scams, and Asa332 refers to a scam prevention link again.

So the key topics here are "Cosmos ecosystem" and "Zealy campaign" since they're mentioned multiple times in the context of starting to learn about the ecosystem. Then there's "scam prevention" which comes up twice when discussing why messages were deleted. The deletion of messages by Arman_231 is also a point, but the main topics seem to be the ecosystem, the Zealy campaign, and scam prevention. I should check if there are any other recurring themes. The user's question is about starting to learn, so Zealy campaign is a method suggested. Scam prevention is related to the deletion of messages. 

I need to make sure not to include usernames or specific links, just the topics. So the main topics are Cosmos ecosystem, Zealy campaign, and scam prevention. Let me verify if these are the most prominent. Yes, the user's initial question is about learning Cosmos, Asa332's response is about Zealy, and the subsequent messages involve scam prevention and message deletion. The Zealy link is shared twice, so that's a key topic. Scam prevention is mentioned twice as well. 

Therefore, the comma-separated list should be Cosmos ecosystem, Zealy campaign, scam prevention.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to analyze the sentiment of the provided chat messages. The sentiment categories are positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with the earliest timestamp:

1. **Asa332 at 13:32:09**: They mention that their messages were deleted by Arman_231 and ask for a reason, noting that most messages are from the Cosmos ecosystem Twitter. This seems like a complaint or concern, so maybe negative or neutral. The mention of deletion could imply frustration, leaning towards negative.

2. **VladimirSmirnov1995 at 13:34:18**: Asks how to start learning about the Cosmos ecosystem. This is a question seeking information, so neutral. No clear positive or negative emotion here.

3. **Asa332 at 13:36:30**: Recommends starting with the Cosmos ecosystem Zealy campaign to learn about projects. This is helpful advice, so positive.

4. **VladimirSmirnov1995 at 13:38:13**: Says "thank you so much!" which is clearly positive.

5. **Asa332 at 13:38:44**: Asks to wait a second while they share a link. Neutral, as it's a simple request without emotional language.

6. **Arman_231 at 13:41:35**: Apologizes for deleting messages, acknowledges being wrong, and mentions there are many scams. The apology and admission of fault suggest a negative sentiment due to the deletion issue, but the context about scams might add some nuance. However, the main emotion here is regret, so possibly negative.

7. **Asa332 at 13:46:16**: Says "its okey" (probably a typo for "okay"), asks to check next time, and mentions applying scam prevention. The typo might not affect sentiment. They're responding to the apology, so maybe neutral or slightly positive because they're offering understanding but also caution.

8. **Asa332 at 13:46:42**: Shares a Zealy link. Neutral, as it's just a link without any emotional words.

Now, considering the overall conversation.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, and next steps from this chat text. First, I need to read through the messages carefully to understand the context.

Starting with the first message from Asa332 at 13:46:42, they shared a link to a Zealy campaign. Then another message from Asa332 at 13:46:16 says "apply the scam prevention" with some emojis. That seems like an action item because they're telling someone to take a specific action.

Looking at Arman_231's message at 13:41:35, they apologize for deleting messages and mention there are a lot of scams. This might indicate a decision they made to delete messages to prevent scams, but since it's an apology, maybe the action item is more about applying scam prevention in the future.

Asa332's message at 13:38:44 says they'll share the Zealy link in a second. Then VladimirSmirnov1995 thanks them at 13:38:13. The next message from Asa332 at 13:36:30 suggests starting with the Cosmos ecosystem Zealy campaign to learn about projects. Vladimir asks how to start learning about Cosmos at 13:34:18.

So, the main action items would be:
1. Asa332 needs to share the Zealy campaign link, which they did later. But since the first message already has the link, maybe the action is to check that link.
2. Applying scam prevention measures, as mentioned by Asa332.
3. Vladimir should start with the Cosmos ecosystem Zealy campaign as a next step to learn.

I should make sure not to include the apology from Arman as an action item unless there's a specific next step mentioned, which there isn't. The decisions here might be Arman deleting messages (past action) but the next step is to apply scam prevention. Also, the suggestion from Asa332 to Vladimir is a next step. Need to present these clearly without the timestamps or usernames, just the actions, decisions, or next steps.
</think>

**Action Items, Decisions, or Next Steps Extracted:**  

1. **Check the Cosmos ecosystem Zealy campaign link** shared by As
