Putting tweets in context of intentions:
The account appears to be promoting a hackathon event series focused on web3 privacy solutions. They're trying to build credibility by mentioning real-world events (Berlin) and associating with well-known figures in the space (Vitalik Buterin). The reference to cypherpunk philosophy and human rights framing suggests they're positioning themselves within a broader ideological movement in blockchain technology. The "secret mentorship session" and other cryptic elements seem designed to create exclusivity and FOMO (fear of missing out) to drive interest in their events.
