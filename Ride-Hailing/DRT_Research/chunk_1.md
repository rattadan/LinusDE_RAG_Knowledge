User cost for DRT includes waiting for pick-up, travel time, and schedule penalty. •
Total cost minimized by changing capacity, waiting users, and demand distribution. •
User equilibrium, system optimum, and demand management strategies are identified.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The provided text appears to be a research article or study on demand responsive transit systems (DRT) with time-dependent demand. Here's a summary of the main points:

**Introduction**

* Demand responsive transit systems are designed to manage demand in real-time to provide efficient and effective public transportation.
* Time-dependent demand, where demand changes over time, is a key factor in designing these systems.

**Key Concepts**

* **Agency cost**: The cost incurred by the agency (transit system) due to various factors such as operating costs, maintenance expenses, and regulatory requirements.
* **User cost**: The cost incurred by individual users, including waiting for pick-up, travel time, and schedule penalty.
* **Total cost minimization**: Finding a balance between minimizing agency costs and maximizing user satisfaction.

**Analytical Model**

* An analytical model is developed to analyze the behavior of DRT operations in terms of agency costs, user costs, and total costs.
* The model takes into account factors such as capacity, waiting users, and demand distribution.

**Key Findings**

* **User equilibrium**: A state where the sum of user costs equals the sum of agency costs, resulting in a stable and efficient operation.
* **System optimum**: A state where the system is operating at its optimal level of efficiency, minimizing both agency and user costs.
* **Demand management strategies**: Strategies to manage demand effectively, including changing capacity, waiting users, and demand distribution.

**Conclusion**

The article highlights the importance of understanding the complexities of DRT operations with time-dependent demand. By developing an analytical model and identifying key findings on user equilibrium, system optimum, and demand management strategies, researchers can better design and operate effective DRT systems that balance agency costs and user satisfaction.
