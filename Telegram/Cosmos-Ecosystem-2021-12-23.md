## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully to understand the key points. The text consists of several chat messages and tweets from different users related to the Cosmos Ecosystem.

First, there's a tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem on December 23, 2021, mentioning their new roadmap. The main points here are IBC integration and Osmosiszone listing, three new useful apps, developers funding, and other upcoming updates. They also tagged Fetch_ai and FET. I need to note these elements as part of their strategic developments.

Next, Raul_SRE announces that their PRESTASHOP plugins for paying with Cosmos coins are now in production, starting with BCNA. They plan to release and maintain e-commerce plugins for Cosmos chains. This seems important for expanding Cosmos' usability in real-world applications, especially e-commerce.

Another tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem introduces NetaMoney and mentions more VC money projects coming soon, along with some user tags. Then there's a message from leonoorcosmos about BitCanna being used at Zamnesia, which they claim is a first in the ecosystem. The link provided is to a Twitter post from BitCannaGlobal.

Putting this together, the key points are the roadmap updates (IBC, Osmosis listing, new apps, developer funding), the e-commerce plugins for Cosmos coins, the introduction of NetaMoney, and the BitCanna integration with Zamnesia. The decisions here include strategic partnerships, product launches, and funding initiatives.

I should make sure the summary is concise, highlighting each main point without extra details. Focus on the roadmap elements, the plugins, new projects like NetaMoney, and the BitCanna use case. Avoid mentioning the individual users beyond their contributions, and keep it structured so each key decision or update is clear.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user provided a series of chat messages or tweets related to the Cosmos ecosystem. My task is to go through each message and identify the key topics, then list them separated by commas.

First, looking at the first tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem. They mention IBC integration and Osmosis listing. IBC is a big thing in Cosmos for interoperability, so that's a main topic. Osmosis is a DEX in the Cosmos space, so listing there is important. Then they mention three new apps, which are useful. Developers funding and more other stuff. Also tagged Fetch.ai and $FET. So possible topics here: IBC integration, Osmosis listing, new apps, developer funding, Fetch.ai.

Next message from Raul_SRE talks about PrestaShop plugins for paying with Cosmos coins, specifically BCNA. They're starting with BitCanna but plan to do more for Cosmos chains. So topics here: PrestaShop plugins, Cosmos coins payment, BitCanna.

Third message again from Cosmos Ecosystem mentions JunoNetwork ecosystem development and NetaMoney. They also note it's a 0 VC money project. So topics: JunoNetwork ecosystem, NetaMoney, 0 VC money projects.

The last message from leonoorcosmos talks about paying at Zamnesia with BitCanna. It's highlighted as a new thing in the ecosystem. So topics: Zamnesia payment, BitCanna.

Now I need to compile all these topics without duplicates. Let me list them again:

- IBC integration
- Osmosis listing
- New apps (maybe specify they're Cosmos-related? But the tweet says "3 new apps (very useful)")
- Developers funding
- Fetch.ai
- PrestaShop plugins
- Cosmos coins payment
- BitCanna
- JunoNetwork ecosystem
- NetaMoney
- 0 VC money projects
- Zamnesia payment

Wait, some might be duplicates or related. For example, BitCanna is mentioned in two messages. But each mention is a different topic: one is about PrestaShop plugins, the other about Zamnesia payment. So they should be separate. Also, "new apps" is a general term, but in the context of the Cosmos ecosystem, so maybe just "new apps" is okay. Similarly, "developers funding" is clear in

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a few messages from different users on the same day. I need to go through each one and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, looking at the combot message from Cosmos Ecosystem. They mention a new roadmap with IBC integration and Osmosis listing, three new apps, developer funding, and "and more other!" The emojis used are calm and rocket, which usually indicate excitement or positive movement. Words like "clearly," "opened-community," "very useful," and "üöÄ" all seem positive. So that's a positive sentiment.

Next, Raul_SRE's message about PrestaShop plugins being in production. They're excited, using emojis like ü§úü§õ which are fists bumping, showing enthusiasm. The phrase "NOW ON PRODUCTION" and exclamation points suggest a positive update. Definitely positive.

Another combot message from Cosmos Ecosystem again. They talk about being glad to oversee JunoNetwork's ecosystem, introducing NetaMoney, and mention "0 VC money projects" with a üòé emoji. The words "glad," "üî•" emojis, and the announcement of new projects indicate positivity. So positive again.

Lastly, leonoorcosmos's message. They use "goeeee" with multiple üî• emojis, mention paying at Zamnesia with BitCanna, and note it's something new in the ecosystem. The exclamation points and phrases like "pretty hot" and "hasn‚Äôt been done before" show excitement. This is also positive.

Putting it all together, all the messages are positive. The user might want a summary of each, but the main task is to determine the overall sentiment. Since each part is positive, the overall sentiment is positive. I should mention each section's sentiment and then conclude the overall.
</think>

The sentiment of the provided text is **positive**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Cosmos Ecosystem (combot)**:  
   - Highlights progress (IBC integration, Osmosis listing, new apps, developer funding) with emojis like üååüí´ and üöÄ.  
   - Phrases like "very useful," "üî•," and "more other!" convey excitement and optimism.  

2. **Raul_SRE**:  
   - Announces successful deployment of PRESTASHOP plugins for Cosmos coins with enthusiastic emojis (ü§úü§õ) and exclamation

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the given text. The text includes several chat messages, mostly tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem and others. Let me go through each message one by one.

First message from Cosmos Ecosystem on 2021-12-23 at 15:31: They mention a new roadmap with IBC integration and Osmosiszone listing. Then there's 3 new apps, developers funding, and more. The action items here might be the IBC integration, listing on Osmosiszone, developing the 3 apps, and funding developers. 

Next, Raul_SRE at 15:22: They released PrestaShop plugins for paying with Cosmos coins, starting with BCNA and plan to release more for other Cosmos chains. So the action items here are releasing and maintaining e-commerce plugins for Cosmos chains.

Third message from Cosmos Ecosystem again at 15:14: They talk about supporting JunoNetwork ecosystem, introducing NetaMoney, and more VC money projects coming. The action items here could be overseeing JunoNetwork's development, introducing NetaMoney, and preparing more VC-related projects.

Lastly, leonoorcosmos at 15:10: Mentions that you can now pay at Zamnesia with BitCanna, which is a first in the ecosystem. The action item here is the implementation of BitCanna payments on Zamnesia.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any specific next steps or decisions. Each of these seems to be announcements, but the action items are the things they're planning to do next. For example, the plugins are already released, but they mention they will release and maintain more. The roadmap items are upcoming, so those are next steps. Also, the BitCanna integration is a completed step, but maybe the next steps are expanding this to other places. However, the user might want both completed and upcoming actions. Wait, the instruction says "extract any action items, decisions, or next steps". So both completed and planned could be included. 

Wait, but the example in the user's mind might be looking for future actions. Let me check each part again. 

First tweet: new roadmap includes IBC integration and Osmosis listing. So those are next steps. 3 new apps, developers funding.
