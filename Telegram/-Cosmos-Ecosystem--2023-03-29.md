## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to go through each message and pick out the important information.

Starting with citizenweb3's message. They're looking for a community manager for Citizen Cosmos. Important points: English proficiency is a must, remote work, payment in crypto. They mention they're an ecosystem developer working on education, infrastructure, content, partnerships, and development. They want someone with a free schedule but able to work full-time, not a moderator or SMM person. They prefer in-house candidates familiar with Cosmos and Ethereum. Also, they ask people to DM them with a few lines about themselves and experience, not to send a CV first.

Next, leonoorcosmos posted a dev update from March 2023. Key points: chain upgrade and a new web wallet. They provide links to Medium and Twitter for more info.

miyoga811 is asking about the results of the last Crew3 event. They want to know when the results will be released.

YouTube4SEO just says hello. Probably not important for the summary unless there's context I'm missing, but since it's a greeting, maybe it's just noise here.

So the main elements are the job posting and the dev update. The job requires specific skills: English, crypto, Cosmos/Ethereum familiarity. The dev update mentions chain upgrade and web wallet. The other messages are either a question about event results and a greeting. The greeting can be omitted unless needed, but the question about Crew3 is a key point as well.

Wait, the user said to focus on key points and decisions. So the decisions here are Citizen Cosmos hiring a community manager, BitCanna releasing a dev update with chain upgrade and web wallet, and miyoga811 asking about Crew3 results. The greeting from YouTube4SEO doesn't add much, so maybe leave that out.

Putting it all together: Citizen Cosmos is hiring a full-time remote community manager with English and blockchain expertise (Cosmos/Ethereum). They emphasize it's not a moderation role. BitCanna announced their March dev update with chain upgrade and web wallet, linking Medium and Twitter. Miyoga811 is inquiring about Crew3 event results. Payment in crypto for the job, and they want applicants to DM without sending a CV first.

I need to make sure

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key topics.

Starting with the first message from citizenweb3. They're hiring a community manager for Citizen Cosmos. The main points here are the job position (Community Manager), the requirement for English proficiency, remote work, crypto rewards, their focus areas like education, infrastructure, content, partnerships, and development. They also specify they're not looking for a moderator or SMM person, and prefer someone familiar with Cosmos and Ethereum. So topics here would be Community Manager, Remote Work, Crypto Rewards, Ecosystem Development, Education, Infrastructure, Content, Partnerships, Blockchain Development, Cosmos, Ethereum.

Next, leonoorcosmos's message is about a dev update release for March 2023. They mention a chain upgrade and a new web wallet. The links are to Medium and Twitter. Topics here: Dev Update, March 2023, BitCanna Project, Chain Upgrade, Web Wallet, Medium Page, Twitter Announcement.

Then miyoga811 is asking about the results of a Crew3 event. The topic here is Crew3 Event Results.

Lastly, YouTube4SEO's message is just a greeting, so maybe YouTube Channel or SEO, but since it's a simple hello, perhaps the main topic is just a greeting. But the user might consider the username as part of the topic? Wait, the username is part of the text, but the instruction says "main topics from this text". The text from YouTube4SEO is "Hello guysüôÇ". Since the username is YouTube4SEO, maybe the topic is related to their YouTube channel. But the message itself is just a greeting. However, considering the context of the other messages which are about job postings and project updates, maybe the user wants to capture the intent. But this one is just a greeting. Maybe the main topic here is "Greeting" or "YouTube Channel Promotion". Hmm, but the message is very short. The username might indicate the person's role, but the text is just a hello. So perhaps only "Greeting" is relevant here.

Now compiling all these topics into a list. Need to ensure they are distinct and relevant. Let me check again:

1. Citizen Cosmos Community Manager Hiring
2. Remote Work
3. Crypto Rewards
4.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of each of these texts. Starting with the first one from citizenweb3. They're looking to hire a community manager for Citizen Cosmos. The message is pretty straightforward, listing requirements and what they're not looking for. Words like "must", "important", and "preferably" might indicate some urgency or specific needs, but overall it's a job posting. There's no negative language here, just informative. So I'd say neutral because it's a factual announcement.

Next, leonoorcosmos posted about a dev update release. They mention new features like a chain upgrade and a web wallet, and direct people to their Medium and Twitter. The emojis üåøüöÄ and the exclamation mark suggest enthusiasm. Positive words like "latest news" and "released" show excitement. Definitely positive sentiment here because they're sharing progress and achievements.

Then there's miyoga811 asking about the results of a Crew3 event. The question is direct, but there's a bit of impatience implied with "when will" and the lack of a question mark. They might be frustrated or eager for an update. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but the tone seems a bit negative, maybe expecting a delay or not getting the info they wanted. So neutral leaning towards negative, but since it's just a question, maybe neutral.

Lastly, YouTube4SEO says "Hello guysüôÇ". The smiley emoji adds a friendly touch. It's a greeting, so positive. The sentiment here is positive because it's welcoming and friendly.

Wait, but miyoga811's message might be more negative if they're annoyed about the delay. But since it's just a question without explicit negative words, maybe neutral is safer. The others are clear: job post neutral, dev update positive, greeting positive. I should check each again to confirm.

Here's the sentiment analysis for each message:

1. **citizenweb3**: **Neutral**  
   - The text is a factual job posting with requirements and instructions. While professional, it lacks overt positive/negative language, focusing on information dissemination.

2. **leonoorcosmos**: **Positive**  
   - Emojis (üåøüöÄ), exclamation marks, and phrases like "just released" and "latest news" convey enthusiasm about project updates.

3. **miyoga811**: **Neutral (
