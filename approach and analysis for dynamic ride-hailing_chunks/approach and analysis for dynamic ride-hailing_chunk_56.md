I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

Since this strategy creates (overlapping) zones
around each existing parking lot, we consider meaningful, problemrelated zones that explicitly integrate the information about the parking
lot locations as well as the available time to respond to a request. By
doing so, contrary to the other approaches, we also overcome potential
discretization issues during zone creation. Preliminaries. The key element of the strategy is to determine how
important or valuable an additional vehicle for a given parking lot
would be. For that, we first determine the expected short-term future
demand 𝑑 in the respective parking lot zone as well as the supply
𝑠 in this zone. Then, an undersupply probability for that lot zone is
computed using a Poisson distribution:
𝑝undersupply =

∞
∑
𝑑 𝑘 𝑒−𝑑
𝑘! 𝑘=𝑠+1

(7)

Formula (7) gives the probability of more incoming requests in the
short-term future than available vehicles in this lot zone. The higher
this probability, the better it is to send an additional vehicle to this
parking lot.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section explains the technical details and parameters for creating zones around each existing parking lot in a ride-hailing system, which is part of dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies.

1. The exact technical details: 
The key element of the strategy involves determining the expected short-term future demand (𝑑) and supply (𝑠) in each parking lot zone.
2. Parameters:
- Expected short-term future demand (𝑑): This is a crucial input parameter for determining the undersupply probability.
- Supply (𝑠): Represents the available number of vehicles in each parking lot zone.
3. Processes:
The calculation of the undersupply probability (Formula 7) is performed using a Poisson distribution, which models the occurrence of events (additional requests) in relation to the expected demand and supply.

Specifically:

- The Poisson distribution formula (𝑝undersupply = ∞∑𝑑 𝑘! 𝑘=𝑠+1) calculates the probability of more incoming requests than available vehicles.
- The parameters for the distribution are determined by:
  - Expected short-term future demand (𝑑)
  - Supply (𝑠)

The process is repeated for each parking lot, and the zones with higher undersupply probabilities are considered for additional vehicle allocation.

This section connects to or builds upon the surrounding context in that it provides a technical framework for dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies. The context mentions various references on the topic of simulation and modeling, dynamic dispatch and repositioning, and rebalancing strategies, which this chunk explains in detail.

To answer any specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:

- The required parameters (expected short-term future demand, supply) are not explicitly stated.
- The process involves using a Poisson distribution to calculate the undersupply probability for each parking lot zone.
- The context assumes access to simulation platforms and datasets/challenges mentioned in the provided references.
