Mitigation

Being banned from the App Store: If Apple decides that
nRide is not abiding by the App Store terms of service, they
can remove the application from the store. The foreseeable reasons why nRide would be banned from
the App Store are related to anti-money-laundering concerns
associated with the use of blockchain. nRide will implement
all the appropriate AML processes to meet Appleâ€™s
requirements.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that you're discussing a company called nRide and its potential risks and mitigation strategies, specifically related to being banned from the App Store due to anti-money-laundering (AML) concerns.

To break down this information:

* The issue is with the app's use of blockchain technology.
* Apple has set AML processes in place for its App Store.
* If nRide fails to comply with these requirements, it could be banned from selling its app on the App Store.
* To avoid this, nRide plans to implement appropriate anti-money-laundering procedures.

The risk of not being able to hire the right people is not mentioned in this specific scenario. However, if there are other risks associated with hiring staff, you may want to consider those as well when exploring mitigation strategies.
