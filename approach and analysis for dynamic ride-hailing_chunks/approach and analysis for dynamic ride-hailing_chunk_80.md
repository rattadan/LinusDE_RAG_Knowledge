I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

Fig. 3. Service rate of the best assignment strategy in different settings with varying fleet sizes. (IZB), global matching (GM), restricted global matching (GM(R)), and our
undersupply probability (UP) strategy. The best strategy per problem
setting is highlighted. It is clearly evident that our proposed repositioning strategy outperforms the benchmark instances significantly in
most problem settings.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the specific text chunk:

**1. Technical details, parameters, or processes described:**
The technical detail being described is a comparison of service rate and waiting time for different repositioning strategies across various instance settings, specifically fleet size 100. The process involves calculating and comparing the performance metrics (service rate and waiting times) using specific algorithms (e.g., MMR strategy).

**2. Connection to or building upon surrounding context:**
This chunk is connected to the broader topic of dynamic dispatch and repositioning in ride-hailing systems, as it provides a comparison of different strategies across various instance settings. The context suggests that this analysis is part of a larger study or research paper on optimizing ride-hailing services.

**3. Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**
None are explicitly mentioned in the provided text chunk. However, it can be inferred that the analysis requires:

* A dataset with varying fleet sizes (100 instances)
* Different repositioning strategies (e.g., IZB, GM, GM(R), UP strategy)
* Service rate and waiting time metrics as performance indicators
* A simulation or modeling framework to generate instance settings

To fulfill these requirements, a more detailed context would be necessary, including the specific dataset used for the analysis.
