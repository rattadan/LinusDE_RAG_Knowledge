## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 57

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Please note that for big instances, a slightly modified
version of this formula has to be used because ùëò! can grow beyond
the limits of typical datatypes. The modified formula as well as its
derivation can be found in Appendix A. This undersupply probability
idea makes it possible to explicitly balance higher repositioning costs
and increased rewards due to a higher service rate. In settings where,
instead of the number of served requests, the overall profit of the
system is the main objective (e.g., Kullman et al., 2021), it should be
calculated whether repositioning orders are worth the additional travel
costs. For that, we can estimate the expected reward per request in the
lot zone under consideration based on historical data. Since the reward
depends on the distance traveled, average requests in the city center
might have different expected rewards than requests in outer areas. Multiplying the expected reward with the undersupply probability
leads to an expected missed reward.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**
The current text chunk describes a scenario involving dynamic optimization models used for managing fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals. It mentions specific mathematical concepts, such as:

1. Dynamic optimization models
2. Real-time demand signals
3. Machine learning techniques (specifically reinforcement learning)
4. Expected reward per request

**Connection to the Surrounding Context:**
This chunk is connected to the surrounding context through its discussion of ride-hailing systems and their operations. The text highlights various studies and research papers related to autonomous taxis, shared mobility fleets, and optimization strategies for repositioning fleets.

The current text chunk specifically builds upon this background by introducing a mathematical framework for calculating expected missed rewards in dynamic optimization models. It provides a theoretical explanation for why undersupply orders might not be worth the additional travel costs, using the concept of an expected missed reward as a measure of profit.

**Requirements and Conditions:**
The requirements mentioned are:

1. The need to explicitly balance higher repositioning costs with increased rewards due to a higher service rate.
2. The use of machine learning techniques for optimizing fleet operations.

Additionally, the text assumes that there is sufficient data available to estimate expected reward per request in different regions (e.g., city center vs. outer areas), which would allow for calculating the undersupply probability and adjusting the optimization model accordingly.

Overall, this chunk provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how dynamic optimization models can be applied to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals, while considering factors like repositioning costs and rewards.
