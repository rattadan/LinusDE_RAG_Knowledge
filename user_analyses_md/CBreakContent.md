Putting this tweet in the context of the author's intentions:
This tweet appears to be part of a broader effort to provide critical perspective on the speculative nature of Web3 investments. By using a reference to the $Trump token - which has likely been a volatile or hyped investment - the author is making a point about the odds being against casual investors in this space. The casino metaphor suggests they view Web3 trading as highly speculative and potentially risky for the average investor. The author seems to want to temper enthusiasm about Web3 investments with some sobering statistics and analysis.

The author appears to be positioning themselves as someone who provides thoughtful commentary on Web3 trends, rather than just hype or promotion. They're using specific data points to make a broader point about market dynamics, which suggests they value critical thinking and caution in the Web3 space.
