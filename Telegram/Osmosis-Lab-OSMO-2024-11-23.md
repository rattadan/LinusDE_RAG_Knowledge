## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages, so I need to parse through each one and identify the main issues and updates.

First, looking at the timestamps, the messages are from different times on 2024-11-23. The main topics seem to be around Osmosis, Keplr issues, USDT routing fixes, some bridge problems, and discussions about Cosmos vs Ethereum. There's also mention of a new interface called Polaris and some pool creation issues.

Starting with the latest messages at 23:32:36 and 23:32:01. GPKwee says there's no update from the dev team, and sdraste is asking about the ETA for USDT routing fix. That's a key point: USDT routing fix is pending with no ETA.

Then dropperjack at 23:01:36 mentions using LEAP instead of Keplers, which is confusing. But earlier, at 22:58:25, he says Ethereum is broken and Cosmos is king. GPKwee responds about Cosmos not needing contracts for wallets, all L1 chains. MaLeKExc asks how to add OSMO in Keplr, and GPKwee says Osmo is automatic. So key points here: Cosmos ecosystem (Keplr) automatically includes OSMO, no contract needed. Also, issues with Ethereum, preference for Cosmos.

art_design_geek has a problem with Keplr swaps not working on iOS but Chrome is okay. WorkerBee_3 is troubleshooting, suggesting refresh, checking if it's app-related, mentions Polaris might fix. Then art_design_geek says withdrawals to Ethereum had errors, WorkerBee suggests using squid router or CCTP from Circle. So key points: iOS app issues with Keplr swaps, solutions suggested for USDC withdrawal.

Other messages include users discussing stuck transactions on the Dogechain bridge via int3face.zone, with niiipp and profesija having issues. kychuli and WorkerBee_3 mention contacting support, possible relaying issues, and suggest checking explorers. Also, some pool creation issues with high fees and needing CLI fixes. So bridge problems with Dogechain, stuck txns, pool creation issues with USDC and needing technical support.

There's

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as comma-separated values. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or subjects.

Looking at the text, there are several mentions of technical issues with the Keplr wallet, like problems adding OSMO or transaction errors. Then there's a lot of discussion around Osmosis, including its performance, pools, and the upcoming Polaris update. Cosmos ecosystem is another topic, especially comparing it to Ethereum and mentioning LEAP. 

USDT routing fixes and bridge issues come up multiple times, particularly with the Int3facechain bridge and stuck transactions. There's also talk about liquidity pools, creating them, fees, and problems with adding liquidity. 

Meme coins and market speculation are present, with users discussing price predictions and their experiences with different coins. The Int3face team's lack of communication channels like Telegram or Discord is a concern for some. 

Support and communication with the dev team is a theme, as users are asking for ETAs and updates. Ethereum's issues are mentioned, contrasting with Cosmos. Additionally, there are references to specific tools like ValueRouter.com and technical troubleshooting steps. 

I should compile all these into a list without repeating similar topics. Let me make sure each topic is distinct and captures the essence of the messages. Maybe combine related terms like "Osmosis UX issues" and "Polaris update" since they're connected. Also, check for any other minor topics I might have missed. Alright, that should cover the main points.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages carefully. The text is a series of chat messages, so I'll have to go through each one and determine the sentiment for each line.

First, the user mentioned that the sentiment should be positive, negative, or neutral. I'll look for keywords, emojis, punctuation, and the overall tone of each message. Let's break it down line by line.

1. **GPKwee at 2024-11-23T23:32:36+00:00: there are no further updates from the devs team**
   - This seems neutral. It's a statement of fact, no clear positive or negative words.

2. **sdraste at 2024-11-23T23:32:01+00:00: any eta for the usdt routing fix?**
   - Neutral. The user is asking for an ETA, which is a request for information without emotional language.

3. **dropperjack at 2024-11-23T23:01:36+00:00: Keplers sucks and confusing, use LEAP**
   - Negative. "sucks" and "confusing" are negative terms.

4. **MaLeKExc at 2024-11-23T22:59:21+00:00: found it thanks**
   - Positive. "Thanks" indicates gratitude.

5. **dropperjack at 2024-11-23T22:58:25+00:00: Ethereum is broken still, I think Cosmos is king**
   - Negative towards Ethereum ("broken still"), positive towards Cosmos ("king"). But since the user is comparing two, maybe the overall sentiment here is positive for Cosmos but negative for Ethereum. However, the message as a whole might be considered mixed, but since the user is stating their opinion, perhaps the sentiment is positive for Cosmos but the overall line might be neutral if both are balanced. Wait, but "Ethereum is broken still" is clearly negative, and "Cosmos is king" is positive. The user is expressing a negative sentiment about Ethereum and a positive about Cosmos. But the

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any tasks, decisions made, or steps that need to be taken.

Starting from the top, GPKwee says there are no further updates from the devs team. That's a status update, but not an action item. Then sdraste asks about the ETA for the USDT routing fix. WorkerBee_3 responds by suggesting using the squid router or withdrawing via Noble and using CCTP. So here, the next steps for sdraste would be to try those methods. 

Looking at dropperjack's message about Ethereum being broken and Cosmos being king. Not an action item but an opinion. MaLeKExc found something, so no action needed. GPKwee explains that Cosmos doesn't need contracts for wallets, which is info but not an action. 

MaLeKExc asks how to add OSMO in Keplr. The next step here is for MaLeKExc to follow the instructions provided, maybe check the support site. Then there's a message from niiipp asking if someone received a refund. WorkerBee_3 mentions letting the team know about an issue, so that's an action item. 

WorkerBee_3 also asks if the issue is within the app and checks if the user updated and restarted. The user vveendettaa mentions an iOS issue with Keplr swaps. So the next step for WorkerBee_3 is to inform the team about the iOS problem. 

Other messages mention Polaris, which is a project, but no specific actions. There's a support link provided multiple times, so maybe that's a recurring suggestion. 

Looking further down, there's a problem with a stuck transaction on the Int3 bridge. kychuli and JohnnyWyles87 discuss contacting the team. So the action item here is to reach out to the Int3 team or open a support ticket. 

Yayes is having issues creating pools and paying fees. kychuli advises using CLI to fix it and mentions Max helping. So next steps are to use CLI or contact Max. 

niiipp and profesija are dealing with a stuck transaction on Dogechain. They mention checking explorers and possible relay issues. The action here might be to check the explorer links provided or
