## Chunk 13

**Original Text:**

We monetize through the sale of $NRIDE tokens, which power components of the nRide protocol, and
application. Concretely, we provide open-source tools, which enable developers to integrate nRide into
their services, and $NRIDE tokens are necessary to use these tools. Additionally, we offer the nRide
mobile application, the first app to use the nRide protocol, which operates on a no-service-fee basis,

A study done by Ridster, showed that within the span of a year only 3% of drivers who signed up to
drive for Uber were still driving (https://www.ridester.com/how-many-uber-drivers-are-there/)

enabling drivers to set their own prices and riders to select the price that best suits them. Our open source
and free protocol and application creates an economy around the $NRIDE token, creating demand
because of its utility factor. Our target market includes riders and drivers looking for transparency,
flexibility and independence; ride-hailing applications looking to cut driver acquisition costs or acquire a
critical driver base; and developers in need of infrastructure to build out applications.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're providing information about the NIRD eToken (NRIDE) project, which seems to be a decentralized protocol for the ride-hailing industry. Here's a breakdown of what you've shared:

1. **Monetization**: The NRIDE tokens are used to power components of the nRide protocol and application, enabling open-source tools that allow developers to integrate the system into their services.

2. **Key Features**:
   - Open-source tools for integration
   - No-service-fee mobile application (nRide) allowing drivers to set their own prices and riders to select prices based on availability

3. **Market Potential**: The project targets a specific market segment, including:
   - Drivers looking for autonomy and flexibility in pricing
   - Riders seeking transparency, choice, and cost-effectiveness
   - Developers requiring infrastructure support for building applications

4. **Ridster Study**: A study by Ridster (https://www.ridester.com/how-many-uber-drivers-are-there/) found that only 3% of Uber drivers signed up within a year.

5. **Benefits**: The NRIDE token creates an economic mechanism, as the utility factor of the tokens is high due to their value in enabling drivers' pricing flexibility and riders' selection of prices based on availability.

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify any specific points or provide further information on this project.
