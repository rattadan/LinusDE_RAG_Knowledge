instances involving bulky baggage and passenger delays are rare, they are crucial as they
introduce substantial disruptions to service operations (Kucharski et al. 2021). The number of dwelling passengers impacts the stop time, with a high statistical significance for alighting the vehicle. Beyond the base stop time, represented by the intercept
of our models, each boarding passenger adds 8.56 s, while each alighting passenger adds
3.32 s to the stop time. Unlike studies suggesting a 10-second increment per passenger
(Lu et al. 2023; Namdarpour et al. 2024), our findings indicate a more modest increase, but
highlight the need to differentiate between boarding and alighting times per person. To address variabilities in stop times and account for occasionally extended PUDO
events, we established fitted log-logistic CDFs for a realistic distribution of boarding and

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the concept of dwell time in ride-pooling services, specifically how it relates to the number of dwelling passengers and their impacts on service operations.

Here's a detailed analysis:

**Technical details:** The chunk describes the relationship between boarding and alighting passengers and the resulting changes in stop times. Specifically, it highlights that each boarding passenger adds 8.56 seconds to the stop time, while each alighting passenger adds 3.32 seconds. This is achieved by establishing fitted log-logistic curve distributions for both boarding and alighting stop times.

**Parameters:** The parameters used are:

* Boarding passengers: 8.56 s per person
* Alighting passengers: 3.32 s per person
* Base stop time (intercept): not specified, but implied to be the minimum amount of time required before a passenger leaves the vehicle

**Processes:** The chunk describes the process by which dwell times are affected by the number of dwelling passengers:

1. Initially, with no passengers (base case), dwell times would be 0 seconds.
2. Each additional boarding passenger would increase dwell times by 8.56 s per person.
3. Similarly, each alighting passenger would decrease dwell times by 3.32 s per person.

**Connection to surrounding context:** This chunk connects to the broader discussion on ride-pooling services, which includes factors like operational aspects (e.g., traffic congestion), sustainability impacts (e.g., carbon emissions), and technological innovations (e.g., autonomous vehicles).

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

* The data used in this analysis is based on simulated ride-pooling scenarios.
* The chunk assumes a realistic distribution of boarding and alighting stop times, but does not account for variations due to other factors.
* The results may be subject to error margin (e.g., due to differences in simulated models or data quality).
* The study focuses on the operational aspects of ride-pooling services and their impact on dwell time.
