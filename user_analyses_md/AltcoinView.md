Contextualizing these tweets in terms of intentions:
These tweets appear to be part of a strategy to establish the account as a source of cryptocurrency market updates. The account owner is sharing price information with an upbeat tone to suggest they have a positive outlook on the market. The mention of letting "the market do the work for you" suggests they're promoting a passive investment approach, which could be risky advice without proper context. The combination of price updates with casual commentary seems designed to create a relatable persona while cultivating an image of market insight.

The second tweet with "We are soooo back" suggests they were referencing a market rebound after a period of decline, positioning themselves as someone who notices market trends.
