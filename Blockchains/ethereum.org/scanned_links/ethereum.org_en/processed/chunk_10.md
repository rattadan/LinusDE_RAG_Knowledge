## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
The content provides guidance on selecting Ethereum wallets, emphasizing security practices like recovery phrases, account management, and the distinction between Ethereum and Bitcoin networks.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Recovery Phrase/Seed Phrase**: A 12â€“24-word sequence used to create Ethereum accounts and recover funds.  
- **Ethereum Account**: A cryptographic key pair (private/public) used for transactions and balances.  
- **Wallet Management**: Tools that allow users to create, manage, and secure multiple Ethereum accounts.  
- **Multi-Wallet Access**: A single wallet can manage multiple accounts, and one account can be accessed by multiple wallets.  
- **Blockchain Networks**: Ethereum and Bitcoin operate on separate networks with distinct blockchains and address formats.  
- **Custodial Solutions**: Platforms like WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) act as intermediaries to bridge Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Recovery Phrase Requirements**: Must be stored securely, with word order critical for reconstructing the key.  
- **Wallet Installation**: Free downloads are recommended, with the option to create a new account or import an existing one.  
- **Multi-Wallet Integration**: Wallets can manage multiple accounts, but recovery phrases are shared across all instances.  
- **Network Separation**: Ethereum and Bitcoin are separate chains, requiring distinct tools for interoperability (e.g., WBTC).  

### Related Topics  
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: The document references external guides for further learning.  
- **Blockchain Interoperability**: Mention of WBTC highlights technical challenges in bridging Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems.  
- **Security Best Practices**: Emphasis on protecting recovery phrases and avoiding unauthorized access to funds.

to identify wallets that should include all necessary features suitable for beginners.

There are also other profile filters to cater to your needs. These are examples of commonly used wallets - you should do your own research before trusting any software.

Once you have decided on a specific wallet, visit their official website or app store, download and install it. All of them should be free.

The first time you open your new wallet you might be asked to choose between creating a new account or importing an existing one. Click on the new account creation.This is the step during which the wallet software generates your Ethereum account.

Some apps will request you to save a secret "recovery phrase" (sometimes called a "seed phrase" or a "mnemonic"). Keeping this phrase safe is extremely important! This is used to generate your Ethereum account and can be used to submit transactions.

Any person who knows the phrase can take control of all funds.Never share this with anyone. This phrase should contain 12 to 24 randomly generated words (the order of the words matters).

No. The wallet is a management tool that helps you to manage accounts. A single wallet might access several accounts, and a single account can be accessed by multiple wallets. The recovery phrase is used to create accounts and gives permission to a wallet app to manage assets.

No, you cannot. Bitcoin and ether exist on two separate networks (i.e. different blockchains), each with their own bookkeeping and address formats. There have been various attempts to bridge the two different networks, of which the most active one is currentlyWrapped Bitcoin or WBTC(opens in a new tab). This is not an endorsement, as WBTC is a custodial solution (meaning a single group of people controls certain critical functions) and is provided here for informational purposes only.
