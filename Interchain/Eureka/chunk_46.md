Help us get better! Join our Discord and select the “Skip Go Developer” role to share your questions and feedback. SVM Transactions
This document explains how to use Skip Go API and Client TypeScript Package to construct SVM transactions. ​
Intro
When a user needs to transfer or swap from an SVM chain (e.g. Solana), the Skip Go API will return an SvmTx type for the developer to pass to the user for signing
This doc is intended for CosmosSDK and EVM developers who aren’t already familiar with the concepts of transaction construction in the SVM and need to use SvmTx to help their users move from/to Solana and other SVM chains.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It looks like you're using Discord, but I'll respond as if we were having a conversation.

So, to get better at helping you, I'd love to join your Discord server (if you have one) and select the "Skip Go Developer" role to share my questions and feedback with you. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "SvmTx"? What's an SvmTx, and why do we need it in this context?
