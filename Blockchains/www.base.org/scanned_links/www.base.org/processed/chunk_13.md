# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_13.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.base.org/*

### Document Overview  
This document outlines how the Base ecosystem is built on the Base blockchain, highlighting features like wallet aggregators, hooks for interacting with smart contracts, and tools for enhancing on-chain applications.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Wallet Aggregators**: Enable seamless integration with multiple wallets (e.g., Coinbase Smart Wallet, EOAs).  
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks (e.g., `useReadContract`, `useBlockNumber`, `useWriteContract`) for managing smart contract interactions.  
- **Template Apps**: Standardized frameworks for building on-chain applications with customizable wallet connections.  
- **Blockchain Data Fetching**: Tools like `queryClient` and `useBlockNumber` to automate updates from the blockchain.  
- **User Experience Enhancements**: Features like `isLoading`, `isFetching`, and `useSimulateContract` to improve transaction feedback.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Wallet Aggregator Integration**: Adds support for Coinbase Smart Wallet and EOAs in the same app.  
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Uses `useReadContract` to fetch data (e.g., balances, addresses) and `useWriteContract` to send transactions.  
- **Template App Customization**: Adds wallet connection logic to standard templates, enabling users to connect their wallets.  
- **Hydration Error Prevention**: Implements `isMounted` to avoid errors during app rendering.  
- **Data Conversion**: Converts blockchain data (e.g., block numbers, contract values) into user-friendly displays.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses `useBlockNumber` and `queryClient` to minimize redundant data fetching and reduce gas costs.  
- **Contract Function Calls**: Configures `pure`/`view` functions with arguments and values using `useWriteContract`.  

### Related Topics  
- **Base Ecosystem**: This document is part of the broader Base ecosystem, which includes tools like RainbowKit and the Base blockchain itself.  
- **Builders Section**: The content connects to the "Builders" section of Base.org, where developers create on-chain applications using the described features.
