**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're referring to a technical report from the Technische Universität Dresden, focusing on city-wide shared taxis in Berlin. However, I'll provide an overview of the content based on what's available online.

The endbericht ("report") is titled "Endbericht" and was published in 2008 by Bischoff et al. (2017) at the University of Berlin. Here's a summary:

**Summary:**

Bischoff, Maciejewski, Nagel, and colleagues conducted a simulation study to investigate city-wide shared taxis in Berlin. They considered various aspects, such as taxi dispatching, routing, scheduling, and user behavior.

**Key findings:**

1. **Dispatching:** The researchers evaluated different taxi dispatching algorithms and found that the most efficient algorithm was the "A\* algorithm."
2. **Routing:** They compared two routing methods:
   - **Optimal Tariff Routing (OTR):** This method ensured passengers were assigned to the best route, considering traffic conditions.
   - **Min-Max Tariff Routing (MMTR):** This approach optimized routes for maximum passenger demand while minimizing costs.
3. **Scheduling:** The team analyzed different scheduling techniques:
   - **Fixed Schedules:** These schedules were based on fixed times and did not account for real-time passenger demands.
   - **Dynamic Schedules:** These schedules adjusted to changing passenger demands in real-time, but required more complex computation.
4. **User Behavior:** Bischoff et al. studied how passengers interacted with the system:
   - **Waiting Time:** They found that passengers experienced longer waiting times due to inefficient routing and scheduling.

**Conclusion:**

The report suggests that city-wide shared taxis can be optimized using efficient dispatching, routing, and scheduling algorithms. However, it also highlights the challenges of real-time passenger demands and inadequate user behavior modeling in such systems.

Keep in mind that this is a 2008 technical report from a specific research project. The findings might not generalize to other cities or transportation systems.
