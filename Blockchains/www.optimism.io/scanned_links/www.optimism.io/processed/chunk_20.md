# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_20.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.optimism.io/*

### Document Overview  
This content outlines the terms and conditions for using Optimism's Services, emphasizing that the Foundation does not own or control certain services (like OP Mainnet) and that users must use Web3 Wallets to interact with the network. It also clarifies the Foundation's liability limitations and service discontinuation policies.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Web3 Wallet**: A tool for interacting with blockchain networks, not managed by the Foundation.  
- **OP Mainnet**: A public, permissionless blockchain running on open-source smart contracts.  
- **Decentralized Network**: Services like OP Mainnet are decentralized, with no central authority controlling them.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing agreements on blockchain, used in OP Mainnet.  
- **Liability Limitations**: The Foundation is not responsible for service modifications, suspensions, or discontinuations.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Web3 Wallet Usage**: Users must authenticate via a Web3 Wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with Ethereum, OP Mainnet, or other OP Chains.  
- **Service Discontinuation**: The Foundation reserves the right to stop or suspend services without notice, and users accept all risks associated with such actions.  
- **Smart Contract Infrastructure**: OP Mainnet relies on open-source smart contracts, which are not under the Foundation's control.  

### Related Topics  
- **Optimism's Services**: The document connects to broader documentation about the platform's features (e.g., OP Mainnet, Other OP Chains).  
- **Web3 Wallet Providers**: The text references terms of service for third-party wallets, indicating dependencies on external providers.  
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: The content implies ties to DeFi ecosystems using Optimism's infrastructure.

to and governed by these Terms. Please read all of these Terms carefully, as they include legal terms, obligations, and restrictions. They cover important information about the Services, eligibility to use the Services, future changes to these Terms, disclaimers, and limitations of liability, including thatyou assume all risk associated with using the Services.

Our Services currently include:

For clarity, the Foundation does not own or control, and the Services do not include, (i) OP Mainnet, which is public, permissionless, and runs on open-source self-executing smart contracts, (ii) any Other OP Chain/Fork, (iii) the Optimism Collective, or (iv) any Web3 Wallet.

The Foundation reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue any Service (in whole or in part) without notice to you. You agree that the Foundation will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of any Service or any part thereof. The Foundation does not undertake or have any obligation to maintain any Service or provide support to you in connection with your use of any Service.

To access certain Services, you must use a Web3 Wallet, which constructs and broadcasts the data (transactions) that allows you to interact with Ethereum, OP Mainnet, or any Other OP Chain/Fork (as applicable). By using your Web3 Wallet in connection with a Service, you acknowledge and agree that you are using the Web3 Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the Web3 Wallet. No Web3 Wallet is created by, operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us. Accordingly, we do not have custody or control over the contents of your Web3 Wallet, and we have no ability to retrieve, transfer or recover its contents. Your relationship with any given Web3 Wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not these Terms.
