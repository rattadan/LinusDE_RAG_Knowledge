**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

---------------------------------------

Deployment testing ensures the feasibility and security of liquidity deployments:

Tests are conducted in the final 7 days of the round. Bidders must provide support, including queries and configurations. Issues must be resolved within 7 days after the round ends. ## What are the consequences if issues are not resolved? -----------------------------------------------------

If issues are unresolved:

The bid may be forfeited, and the project will lose its opportunity to deploy liquidity. In specific cases, the Hydro committee may approve a 30-day deployment extension if sufficient capital is available. ## How are tributes handled? -------------------------

Tributes are managed through the Hydro smart contract:

Tributes are locked during the bid and distributed after the round to voters of successful bids. If the bid fails, tributes are refunded. ## What accountability measures do projects need to follow?

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis**

1. **Exact technical details, parameters, or processes:**
   - Deployment testing involves conducting tests in the final 7 days of the round.
   - Bidders are required to provide support, including queries and configurations, during this period.
   - Issues must be resolved within 7 days after the round ends.
   - Untimely issues resolution may lead to the bid being forfeited.
   - In exceptional cases, the Hydro committee may grant a 30-day deployment extension if sufficient capital is available.
   - Tribute distribution is automated through the Hydro smart contract.
   - Refunds for tributes are automatically triggered if the bid fails.

2. **Connection to surrounding context:**
   - This section is part of the "Key Components and Processes" section, which describes various processes and metrics implemented in the Hydro system.
   - It complements the information provided in the "Bid Submissions" and "Lockups and Voting Power" sections.

3. **Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:**
   - The bid must be submitted before the deployment testing phase.
   - The Hydro committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
   - Bidders must follow the guidelines set by the Hydro committee.
   - The deployment duration is typically up to 3 months, but an extension of up to 30 days may be granted in certain cases.
   - Cap on maximum liquidity rerouted to Hydro is 2.5M ATOM, with pilot rounds starting at 200K native ATOM.

4. **Ambiguity:**
   - Some phrases, such as "sufficient capital is available" for granting deployment extensions, lack specific detail.
   - The section could benefit from providing further clarification on the specific conditions and details that the Hydro committee considers when deciding on an extension.
