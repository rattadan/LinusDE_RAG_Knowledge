This creates a seamless and frictionless transaction process, as the $NRIDE
token serves as the base currency for transaction fees on the OneApp platform. This integration benefits
both parties by placing demand on the $NRIDE token for its utility factor, while simultaneously allowing
OneApp to accrue value through a geographically agnostic form of payment. Additionally, by leveraging
the $NRIDE token for transactions, businesses can benefit from reduced transaction costs and simplified
payment processes, creating a more efficient and cost-effective way to access and use the OneApp
platform. MARKETING & SALES
