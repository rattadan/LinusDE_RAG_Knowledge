**Original Text:**

The costs associated with matches
containing one fictitious element are set to a sufficiently large value. The problem can easily be solved to optimality in a very short time,
even for very large instances, due to its polynomial solution time. Depending on the specific problem under consideration, variants can be
found with additional constraints for sharing applications (Alonso-Mora
et al., 2017) or heterogeneous fleets (Gao et al., 2016). In our study, we compare different matching approach variants that
differ in the following characteristics:
• Cost calculation: The costs 𝑐𝑖𝑗 of a matching (𝑖, 𝑗) are either the
travel time of the vehicle 𝑗 to the pickup location of request 𝑖 or
the total waiting time of the customer once the vehicle arrives
at the respective pickup location. Therefore, the second version
also includes the time the customer is already waiting. In cases
where fairness towards customers is not a concern, two additional
cost calculations could be used.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the provided text chunk:

1. **Technical details and parameters:**
   - The cost calculation in the problem can be broken down into two components:
     1. Travel time to the pickup location (𝑗 to 𝑖)
     2. Total waiting time after arrival at the pickup location
   - These are used as potential costs for matching (𝑖, 𝑗)

2. **Contextual connection and building upon surrounding context:**
   - The problem is framed within a broader discussion of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.
   - It builds upon the references provided, which discuss simulation and modeling approaches to solving problems related to autonomous taxis, shared AV fleets, vehicle rebalancing strategies, demand forecasting, and matching algorithms.

3. **Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**
   - The problem specifically mentions two variants of cost calculation methods:
     1. One uses travel time only (𝑖 to 𝑗)
     2. Another includes the waiting time for customers
   - These variants are designed to take into account different concerns or requirements, such as fairness towards customers in cases where it is not a concern.

By analyzing this specific section, we can understand that it provides detailed technical information about the cost calculation method being explored and how it differs from other potential approaches. This analysis will help readers better comprehend the context and scope of the problem discussed in the surrounding references.
