-80.5 times their initial deposit. •

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I can help you understand the scenario.

This appears to be a description of a scenario where two parties are involved in an e-commerce or online transaction process. Here's a breakdown of what I've identified:

1. The first part of the output mentions "Cancel(A) & Approve(B, secret_a)" and states that it is symmetrical to output 2.

This suggests that when one party cancels (or withdraws their funds), they will receive the same amount as when the other party receives a withdrawal.

2. The next part describes two scenarios: "Cancel(A) and Cancel(B)" where both parties actively cancel, but neither can submit their secret code. In this case, both parties get penalized the same amount (in this case, $80.50), and funds go to the treasury.

3. The third scenario is more interesting: "Cancel(A) AND T1(B)" where Party B never funded their account after the initial transaction. As a result, Party A can withdraw their full deposit.

This suggests that there's a mechanism in place that allows for cancellation of an order when one party has not fulfilled their obligation to the other party (in this case, not funding their account).
