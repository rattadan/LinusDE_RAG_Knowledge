## ICS - Chunk 21

**Document Summary:**

The development of Interchain Security (ICS) for the Cosmos ecosystem represents a significant milestone that paves the way for greater interoperability, security, and economic growth among blockchain networks. Here are some key points summarizing the current state and future outlook:

### Key Achievements:
1. **Replicated Security Launch:**
   - The first consumer chains have successfully launched with replicated security, sharing the validator set of the Cosmos Hub.
   - This model ensures that any attack on a consumer chain would impact the entire ecosystem as much as it would affect the Cosmos Hub itself.

2. **Opt-in Security Development:**
   - Informal Systems and other contributors are working to develop opt-in security, allowing validators to choose which chains they wish to secure independently.
   
3. **Subset Problem Resolution:**
   - The "subset problem" has been identified and is being addressed through the design of new governance proposals, like slash proposals, to mitigate potential attacks.

4. **Mesh Security Research:**
   - Ongoing research into mesh security aims to create a network of interdependent blockchains where validators can participate in multiple chains without compromising security.

### Upcoming Steps:
1. **Opt-in Security Implementation:**
   - Finalizing and deploying opt-in security will provide more flexibility for validators, allowing them to distribute their staked ATOM across different consumer zones.

2. **Mesh Security Design:**
   - Continuing the research and development of mesh security to ensure a robust and secure network of interconnected blockchains.
   
3. **Economic Zone Development:**
   - The ATOM Economic Zone is expected to bring innovative economic opportunities for its members, such as shared validator sets and enhanced inter-IBC functionalities.

4. **Interoperability Enhancements:**
   - Improving IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) functionality, including synchronous IBC, atomic IBC, and packet forwarding, to enhance user experience and security across the ecosystem.

### Long-term Vision:
1. **Sustainable Ecosystem Growth:**
   - By sharing the same validator set, consumer chains can benefit from increased security without needing their own validators, reducing costs and improving overall network resilience.
   
2. **Increased Adoption and Innovation:**
   - The interdependent nature of these blockchain networks is expected to drive innovation and adoption, as developers can leverage the combined strengths of multiple blockchains.

3. **Economic Opportunities:**
   - ATOM holders and validators will have more avenues for earning transaction fees and MEV (Miner Extracted Value) rewards across various zones.
   
### Conclusion:
The launch of Interchain Security marks a significant advancement in the interoperability landscape, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure blockchain ecosystem. As development continues, the Cosmos ecosystem is poised to offer new opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration among its members.

**Original Text:**

Using this model, we can get an objective view of the security that various configurations of replicated and mesh security provide. We've also turned the model into an app that you can use to explore these scenarios yourself. We'll go over a few scenarios below, but you can also click on the links to experiment with them yourself. Replicated Security from the Hub

Let's look at replicated security first. This is what will go live in January 2023. A consumer chain using replicated security has the same cost to censor or control as its provider chain, in this case the Cosmos Hub. The Cosmos Hub grants a very high level of security. Mesh security with a 10% power cap

Next is mesh security with a 10% power cap. This is what Sunny suggested in his talk on mesh security at Cosmoverse 2022. Even though there are some very large chains (including the Hub) providing security, the security is constrained by the power cap. The cost to censor is $83mm and the cost to control is $273mm.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk discusses the development of Interchain Security (ICS) for the Cosmos ecosystem, specifically focusing on two technical details: replicated security and mesh security.

1. **Replicated Security Model**: This model ensures that any attack on a consumer chain would impact the entire ecosystem as much as it would affect the Cosmos Hub itself. The key features include:
	* A shared validator set between the consumer chains and the Cosmos Hub.
	* Replication of security to prevent centralization and ensure equal access to resources.
2. **Mesh Security**: This model aims to create a network of interdependent blockchains where validators can participate in multiple chains without compromising security. Key features include:
	* A 10% power cap to mitigate potential attacks on individual chains.

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing technical details and parameters for replicated security, including the shared validator set, replication model, and security costs.
2. Introducing mesh security as a complementary solution to replicated security, highlighting its unique features and benefits.
3. Connecting this information to the broader context of Interchain Security, discussing how these technical details contribute to the overall vision of a secure, interconnected Cosmos ecosystem.

Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk include:

* Replicated security requiring equal access to resources between consumer chains and the Cosmos Hub
* Mesh security with a 10% power cap limiting potential attacks on individual chains
