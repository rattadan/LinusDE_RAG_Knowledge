## Chunk 14

**Original Text:**

Since demand tends to peak during certain times of the day, an effective demand management strategy that can spread the demand uniformly over time has a key role in optimizing the operations of a DRT system. The objective of this paper is to model the dynamics of DRT scheduling and operations and to identify a management strategy to incentivize users to adapt their request times to be more uniform over time. A dynamic pricing policy can be implemented as an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of the DRT system by forming a uniform distribution of the demand and avoiding the underutilization of the optimal capacity during off-peak times. As a result, the total cost of the agency and users can be minimized by choosing optimal values for the system capacity and the number of waiting requests. Meanwhile an appropriate demand management strategy that can make the demand uniform is required to keep the system optimized over time.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you've provided a passage about Demand Response (DRT) systems, specifically highlighting the importance of managing demand in a way that spreads it uniformly across time and optimizing operations.

To break down this information:

- The passage mentions how demand tends to peak during specific times of the day, necessitating an effective strategy for spreading out demand over time.
- It emphasizes the role of dynamic pricing as a tool to manage demand by creating a uniform distribution over time, thereby minimizing underutilization and maximizing efficiency in DRT systems.
- This strategy is tied to minimizing agency costs and user-related expenses.
- The passage concludes that an appropriate demand management approach is essential for keeping the system optimized across its operational lifecycle.
