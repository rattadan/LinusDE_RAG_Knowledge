The language style is informal, witty, and self-deprecating. The author is using metaphor (comparing themselves to a royal jester) and irony (making being a jester sound prestigious) to create humor. The tone is lighthearted and playful.

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
I don't have enough context to determine if the author is legitimate or not, or if they're claiming to be something they're not. The tweet itself seems authentic in its expression of humor and playfulness. The use of "royal invitation" is likely metaphorical rather than literal.
