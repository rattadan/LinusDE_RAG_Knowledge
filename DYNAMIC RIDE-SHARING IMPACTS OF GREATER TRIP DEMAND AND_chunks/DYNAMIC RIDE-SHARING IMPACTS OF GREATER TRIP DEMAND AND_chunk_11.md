## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 11

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Increased demand for
SAVs in the future, coupled with issues like eVMT and curbside congestion, warrants thorough
study of PUDO zone use, and its influence on SAV operations. This work studies SAV operations and network benefits from use of PUDO “stops” or zones to
aggregate person-trip ends (much like bus stops). The Bloomington, Illinois network is used with
a variety of trip-making intensities (or land use densities), PUDO spacing, and fleet operational
attributes (like single-occupant and shared rides). The next section discusses the simulation
assumptions used, the algorithm behind PUDO locations, and an overview of fleet
characteristics. This is followed by discussion of results and inferences gleaned from this work. MODELING IN POLARIS
A large-scale agent-based modeling suite called POLARIS (Auld et al., 2016) is used in this
study.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis:**

This chunk provides specific technical details about the simulation approach, algorithm, and modeling suite used in the study:

1. **Simulation assumptions:** The text mentions that "a variety of trip-making intensities (or land use densities), PUDO spacing, and fleet operational attributes" are being studied.
2. **Algorithm behind PUDO locations:** It's not explicitly stated what the algorithm is, but based on the context, it appears to be a geographic information system (GIS) or spatial analysis approach that maps out the optimal placement of PUDO zones for shared autonomous vehicles in Bloomington, Illinois.
3. **Large-scale agent-based modeling suite:** The text mentions POLARIS, which is a "large-scale agent-based modeling suite." While this is not explicitly stated, it implies that the model has advanced computational capabilities to simulate large-scale systems.

**Context:**

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context in several ways:

1. **Shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance:** The text mentions shared autonomous vehicles and their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, which sets the stage for discussing the use of PUDO zones.
2. **Congestion pricing with self-driving cars:** The mention of congestion pricing is likely related to the study's focus on optimizing ridesplitting services and managing traffic flows in urban areas.
3. **Consumer preferences:** The text mentions consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use, which implies that the study aims to investigate how shared autonomous vehicles compare to traditional vehicle ownership.
4. **Urban transportation systems:** The timeframe of 2014-2020 suggests that the study is focused on recent developments in the field of urban transportation and mobility.

**Requirements and conditions:**

None mentioned explicitly. However, the following requirements are implied:

1. **Technical expertise:** The text assumes a basic understanding of simulation approaches, geographic information systems (GIS), and agent-based modeling.
2. **Spatial analysis skills:** The study likely requires spatial analysis skills to map out optimal PUDO zone placements for shared autonomous vehicles in Bloomington, Illinois.

**Additional context:**

The text provides additional context by:

1. **Providing references:** This establishes the credibility of the study and its sources.
2. **Introducing key authors:** Mentioning specific authors (e.g., K.M. Kockelman) suggests that the study aims to build upon their work in related fields.
3. **Describing the timeframe:** The mention of a 5-year time frame captures recent developments in the field, indicating that the study is focused on capturing contemporary trends and challenges.
