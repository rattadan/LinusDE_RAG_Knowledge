## Chunk 71

**Original Text:**

To use the nRide application, users
must possess $NRIDE tokens, which interact with the escrow smart contract. nRide captures value from
selling $NRIDE tokens from the DAO and creating an economy around the $NRIDE token. The price of
$NRIDE tokens is expected to appreciate as the user base of the nRide application and the adoption of the
protocol/registry by projects continues to grow, indicating a strong demand for the token. Furthermore, the recent partnership with OneApp, a mobility supply provider company, will allow nRide
to expand its driver registry and offer a streamlined process for businesses to access and use the OneApp
platform. By integrating the $NRIDE token for transactions, businesses can benefit from reduced
transaction costs and simplified payment processes, while OneApp can accrue value through a
geographically agnostic form of payment.
