selling to. Even if they can identify the specific customer profile, itâs equally important that they have existing relationships with that type of person.Â

âAt this stage, itâs less about having a complete understanding of your customer than having a direct path to them,â says Martin. âFounders need to be able to talk to and interview the people who would be their potential customer. Otherwise, itâs not going to be a sustainable idea for a company because it will take six months for them to find the right contacts that might actually want to buy their product.âÂ

Sustainability is core to Codebaseâs philosophy as a startup incubator. The program isnât designed to simply support interesting ideas and getting founders to an MVP. Itâs designed to help founders create an enduring business that solves real customer problems. A technically excellent product isnât a viable business unless founders also have access to customers and the ability to clearly communicate its value.Â

Codebase, like the startups in the program, is constantly iterating on its approach to supporting founders building on Avalanche. The feedback from founders is used to adapt the program in real-time to their needs and the lessons from Cohort 2 will be applied to continue to enhance the program for Cohort 3.

The lessons from Codebase's second cohort highlight what it takes to build a successful Web3 startup in 2025. Founders need the courage to pivot decisively when their initial ideas aren't working, the ability to tell compelling stories about their products from day one, and direct access to their target customers. But perhaps most importantly, they need a support system that goes beyond technical guidance â one that provides comprehensive ecosystem resources while remaining nimble enough to adapt to founders' needs. As Cohort 3 prepares for launch, these insights will continue shaping how Ava Labs nurtures the next generation of builders on Avalanche.
