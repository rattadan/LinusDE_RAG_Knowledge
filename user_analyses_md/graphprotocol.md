<think>
Let me analyze these tweets from the account "graphprotocol" (The Graph protocol).

First, I'll go through each tweet:

1. "gm, web3" - This is a simple greeting to the web3 community. "gm" (good morning) is a common greeting in crypto/web3 communities.

2. "Data is the productive asset of digital economies." - This is making a broader statement about the importance of data as an asset in digital economies.

3. "1‚É£3‚É£ thousand Subgraphs are live and active on The Graph Network." - This tweet is announcing a milestone of 13,000 subgraphs being active on The Graph network. It's promotional, highlighting growth.

4. "1‚É£3‚É£ thousand Subgraphs are live and active on The Graph Network." - Same as #3.

5. "RT @GraphDevs: Fancy Features in Remix https://t.co/7wbRz5E9Uy" - This is a retweet from GraphDevs, linking to content about features in Remix (which is an Ethereum IDE). It's sharing technical content relevant to developers.

6. "RT @TalentProtocol: Happy Builders Day! ü´°\n\nOn May 1st we celebrate the ones building the new internet.\n\nThis year, we're going big: \nüßæ Laun‚Ä¶" - This is a retweet celebrating builders in the web3 space.

7-8. "ICYMI: The Graph is sponsoring sidetracks at the Solana Breakout Hackathon hosted on @SuperteamEarn!\nüõ†Ô∏è Build @Solana Substreams for AI, analytics, or @wormhole - $15k prize pool up for grabs.\n\nGet started ‚¨áÔ∏è" - These tweets are announcing sponsorship of a hackathon, specifically highlighting opportunities to build Substreams for Solana with a prize pool incentive.

Let me now address each of the requested summary elements:
