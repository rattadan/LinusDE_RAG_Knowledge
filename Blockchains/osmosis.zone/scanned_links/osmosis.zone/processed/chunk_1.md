Real users show real love for Osmosis.

People who are new to Cosmos don't truly understand the dominating crushing nature of Osmosis

User Retention
If 100 new addresses used these dexs.... how many would remain?

Here's my experience: Best support experience in whole of crypto - better than any CEX out there.

Osmosis is:
✔️ Layer-1  blockchain ecosystem
✔️ Best DEX in Cosmos
⏳ Interface for the Interchain (Asset Hub)

Osmosis is coming for EVERYTHING

Osmosis is ahead of their time. Top 5 builders in crypto…maybe higher.

The Osmosis UI is really gorgeous

ATOM is Money • Osmosis the DeFi Hub

Osmosis is the premier cross-chain DeFi hub ⚛️  As the liquidity center and primary trading venue of Cosmos, Osmosis is the access point for the world of appchains  More than 50 blockchains are currently connected, with dozens more in development— @dYdX  Chain, or  @Injective_

No doubt that  @osmosiszone  is the most dominant DEX in  @cosmos

The way Milk Tia is fully integrated into osmosis is amazing.

Osmosis is becoming the interchain App Store.
