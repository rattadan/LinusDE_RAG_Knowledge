## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text seems to be a series of chat messages from different users on March 21, 2025.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The first message from abstrct mentions "On-boarding is shaping up." That's a brief note about the progress in onboarding, maybe related to a project or platform.

Then there are two duplicate messages from unknown users celebrating the 1st and 2nd birthdays of NFT news posts. They mention specific hashtags like #DYM, #HELIX, etc., and links to Twitter posts. The key here is the anniversary celebrations and the projects involved.

Another message from wlkatja talks about a game night event for Warden Protocol. It includes details like the game being Tetr.io, the time (17:00 UTC every Friday), rules, and instructions to submit screenshots for XP points. Also, a mention of a beta testing opportunity with a riddle reveal. The important points are the event schedule, participation rules, and the beta test riddles.

Then there's a message from AnubisPhy promoting a challenge involving buying $PLQ on Osmosis, moving and staking it on Planq Network for $ANUBI rewards. They also mention a referral link for a race and hashtags related to Cosmos Ecosystem and airdrops. This seems like a promotional offer for token staking and participation.

faneatiku has a message about BZE's 3rd birthday with a Medium article update covering upgrades, DApp improvements, 2025 roadmap, AMMs, and a new supply cap. The link to the article is provided. Key points here are the anniversary and the project updates.

Other messages include a community townhall announcement on March 26th from drKate_phmn, a link shared by the same user, and some other links from Asa332 and rcjulin_ForkDAO that don't have much context.

So, the main elements to highlight are:

1. Warden Protocol's Game Night event details and beta testing.
2. Birthday celebrations for NFT news posts with specific projects mentioned.
3. AnubisPhy's token staking promotion.
4. BZE's anniversary and their status update.
5. Community Townhall on March

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify recurring themes or topics.

Looking at the text, there are multiple messages. The first one mentions "On-boarding is shaping up" from abstrct. Then there are several birthday messages for NFT News #317 and #56, each listing hashtags like #DYM, #HELIX, #NTRN, #STARS, #UX, #FET, #LAVA, #MINT, #QCK, #QUASAR, #XDEFI. These hashtags are likely topics related to specific projects or platforms in the crypto/NFT space.

Next, there's a message about a game night event for Warden Protocol, mentioning Tetr.io, Discord, Zealy quest, and rules for participation. This seems like an event announcement, so "Warden Game Night" and related terms like "Tetr.io", "Discord", "Zealy" would be topics here.

Another message refers to beta testing and a riddle reveal by Warden Protocol, so topics here might include "Beta Testing", "Riddle Reveal".

Then there's a message from AnubisPhy promoting a crypto challenge involving buying and staking tokens ($PLQ, $ANUBI), mentioning platforms like Osmosis and Planq Network, along with hashtags like #MobileFirst, #Castrum, #Web3, #CosmosEcosystem, #Airdrop. These would be financial and promotional topics.

Other messages include links to Twitter posts, a community townhall announcement, and a birthday greeting for BZE with a Medium article link. These might contribute topics like "Community Townhall", "BZE Turns 3", "Medium Article".

I need to ensure that each topic is distinct and captures the essence of the different messages. Also, the hashtags should be included as they represent specific projects or categories. I should avoid repeating the same topic multiple times even if mentioned in different messages. For example, #NFT appears in multiple birthday messages but should be listed once.

Let me list out all potential topics:

- On-boarding
- Birthday of NFT News (#317 and #56)
- Cryptocurrency projects (DYM, HELIX, NTRN, STARS, UX, FET

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- https (19 mentions)
- news (12 mentions)
- com (12 mentions)
- status (12 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by going through each message one by one.

First, there's a message from "abstrct" saying "On-boarding is shaping up." That sounds positive. "Shaping up" usually means things are improving or coming together well.

Then there are multiple "Happy Birthday" messages for #NFT News #317 and #56. They mention the news being 1 and 2 years old, with emojis like üéÇ and positive hashtags. The sentiment here is definitely positive, celebrating anniversaries.

Next, "wlkatja" writes about a game night, using phrases like "That was very great game!!!" with multiple exclamation points and emojis like ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•. They congratulate others on their roles and express happiness for their achievements, ending with a thank you. This is clearly positive and enthusiastic.

Another message from "wlkatja" announces a beta testing opportunity and riddles. They mention that previous crypto wallets failed a usability test with non-crypto friends, but now they're addressing that issue. The tone here is a bit more serious but still positive because they're promoting a solution and urgency with "last chance."

Then there's a message from "AnubisPhy" promoting a crypto challenge with words like "Ready for a bigger challenge?" and "snag 10% back instantly!" üí∞. They include a referral link and hashtags related to growth and community. This seems positive, encouraging participation.

"rcjulin_ForkDAO" starts with "Good morning all the cosmos üëåüßâüí°" which is friendly and positive, using emojis to convey a good vibe.

Lastly, "faneatiku" shares a birthday announcement for BZE, highlighting updates and a roadmap. They use emojis like üéâ and üöÄ, and phrases like "fresh Medium article" and "Thanks for being part of the journey üíú." This is positive, celebrating milestones and sharing progress.

Looking at all these messages, they're mostly announcements, celebrations, and promotions. The common elements are positive emojis, exclamation points, and words like "great," "happy," "excited," "ready," "congratulations." There's no negative language here. Even the messages that mention past failures (like crypto wallets) are framed in a positive light by showing how they're addressing those issues now.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any tasks, decisions, or upcoming events mentioned.

Starting with the first message from abstrct on March 21, 2025, at 21:01:38. It says "On-boarding is shaping up." That seems like a general update, maybe indicating progress but not a specific action item. I'll note it as a status update rather than an action.

Next, there are two identical messages from unknown at 20:14:33 and 20:14:29. They mention Happy Birthday for #NFT #News #317, which is one year old. There's a link to a Twitter post. Not sure if there's an action here, maybe just celebrating an anniversary. Similarly, the messages at 19:29:05 and 19:29:02 are duplicates for #56, two years old. Again, seems like announcements rather than actions.

Looking at wlkatja's message at 18:32:44. They congratulate on a great game, list roles assigned to users, and thank everyone. Then they mention sending screenshots to Zealy. The instruction here is to send screenshots to Zealy's quest board. That's an action item for the users who played. Also, they mention next week's event, so maybe a next step is preparing for the next game night.

Then drKate_phmn at 15:56:25 mentions a Community Townhall on March 26th. That's a clear next step or event to attend. The previous message from them at 15:54:30 is a link to a Twitter post, which might not be an action unless there's a specific instruction to check it out, but it's not stated.

Another message from wlkatja at 15:07:15 details the Warden Game Night happening every Friday, with specific time, platform (PC, Tetr.io), rules, and instructions. The action items here are: 1. Check the direct link to the private lobby before the event. 2. Use the correct Discord username. 3. Take screenshots and upload to Ze
