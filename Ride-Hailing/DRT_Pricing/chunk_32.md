**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing an approach for improving the accuracy of traffic routing in transportation systems, specifically using Dynamic Routing Theory (DRT) to better estimate travel times between different origin-destination pairs within a given time period. This is a complex problem that can be approached through various approximation methods.

The idea of improving these approximations by computing differentiated averages by time of day or origin-destination relation is an interesting one, suggesting the use of more detailed data or modeling techniques to capture variations in traffic patterns across different times of the day and between different regions. This could potentially increase the accuracy of travel time estimates.

As for publicly available code related to this topic, your reference to the DRT-speed-up program on GitHub highlights a relevant resource for studying transportation routing methods like DRT. The speed-up aspect indicates that the provided program is optimized or efficient in solving certain aspects of the traffic routing problem.

In terms of case studies and simulation experiments, choosing an area such as Greater Berlin provides a specific context to analyze and evaluate different approaches to traffic routing within this region. This could involve comparing various methods (including DRT) with different assumptions, data sets, or scenarios to identify which performs best in predicting travel times across the area.

Simulation experiments would typically involve using computational models that can simulate real-world traffic conditions, taking into account factors like road geometry, driver behavior, and weather, among others. By running these simulations against a diverse set of scenarios, researchers can better understand how different approximations (such as DRT or approximate methods) compare in their ability to accurately predict travel times within the case study area.

These comparisons could help identify areas where more detailed models like DRT provide greater accuracy and insights into real-world traffic patterns. This information is valuable for policymakers, transportation planners, and urban designers who seek to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in cities like Greater Berlin.
