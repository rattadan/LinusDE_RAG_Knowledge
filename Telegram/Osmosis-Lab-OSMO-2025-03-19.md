## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on decisions and main points.

Starting from the top: Mikebarb suggests checking out two URLs, which might be relevant for whatever services they offer. Then xcryptoempereor is asking about a bridge from ERC20 (Avax/Arb) to Cosmos/Osmo. That's a question about cross-chain interoperability. 

Kartoffelfren mentions a "Nice airdrop," so that's a positive note on an airdrop event. Hazzo12 calls something a "Ded coin" and advises not to look at it, which is a negative opinion. Osmosis_news shares an update link from the Lab, so an official update is coming. 

Dhomart comments that no one will make a new project with "cosmos EVM" because EVMOS didn't survive. BasementNodes and Mikebarb have a back-and-forth about the success rate of some asks, which might relate to project proposals or funding attempts. 

Then there's a discussion about EVMOS not being acquired by the hub, and MLIzi speculates that ATOM might acquire OSMO like they did with Evmos, leading to OSMO's downfall. BasementNodes and others debate the likelihood of that acquisition, with some skepticism. 

Other messages mention TVL (Total Value Locked) exploitation plans by ATOM, and a general bearish sentiment about various coins going to zero, except maybe OSMO being the last. 

So the main points are: the bridge question, EVMOS's struggles leading to doubt about Cosmos EVM projects, the speculation about ATOM acquiring OSMO, the bearish outlook on coins, the airdrop mention, and the Osmosis Lab update. Also, some discussions about project failures and support links.

I need to condense these into a summary without getting bogged down in the back-and-forth debates. Focus on the decisions or key opinions expressed. Maybe group similar points. For example, the bridge inquiry, the EVMOS situation and its impact on Cosmos EVM, ATOM acquisition speculation, the bearish predictions, and the official update. Also, mention the support link and the sarcastic comment about success rates. 

Make sure to note that the acquisition idea is disputed, with some saying

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes. The text has several chat messages discussing different topics. Let's break them down one by one.

The first message by mikebarb mentions two URLs: Go.skip.build and app.squidrouter.com. These look like links to tools or services, maybe related to crypto or blockchain. So the topic here could be "Skip Protocol and SquidRouter websites".

Next, xcryptoempereor is asking about a bridge from ERC20 (Avax/Arb) to Cosmos/Osmo. Bridges in crypto usually refer to cross-chain bridges. So the topic here is "Cross-chain bridges from ERC20 to Cosmos/Osmo".

Kartoffelfren says "Nice airdrop". Airdrops are distributions of cryptocurrency tokens, so that's a straightforward topic: "Airdrop".

hazzo12 calls a coin "Ded" (dead) and advises not to look at it. This is negative sentiment about a coin, so "Negative sentiment towards a cryptocurrency".

osmosis_news shares an update from the Lab with a link. The main thing here is the update announcement, so "Osmosis Lab updates" or "Osmosis project updates".

dhomart comments on Cosmos EVM projects, specifically EVMOS not surviving. Cosmos EVM refers to Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility in Cosmos projects. The topic here is "Challenges of Cosmos EVM projects".

BasementNodes and mikebarb discuss the success rate of some asks being less than 0.1%. This relates to the effectiveness or success rate of certain requests or interactions, so "Success rate of asks (less than 0.1%)".

Another message by BasementNodes mentions a project failing as a product despite recognition. This ties into project viability, so "Project viability despite recognition".

MLIzi's messages talk about ATOM acquiring OSMO and EVMOS, leading to their value dropping to zero. There's also mention of liquidity plans and TVL (Total Value Locked). The topics here are "Speculation on ATOM acquiring OSMO/EVMOS", "Liquidity plans involving ATOM and OSMO", and "TVL (Total Value Locked) in Osmo".

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages and wants them categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. First, I need to go through each message one by one.

Starting with the first one: "Mikebarb at 2025-03-19T20:06:57+00:00: I'd check out Go.skip.build or app.squidrouter.com". The user is suggesting checking out some links. It's a recommendation, so maybe positive? But it's neutral unless there's an explicit opinion.

Next: "xcryptoempereor at 2025-03-19T20:06:25+00:00: hey guys, is there a bridge from erc20 (avax/arb) to cosmos/osmo?" This is a question asking about the existence of a bridge. Neutral since it's just seeking information.

"Kartoffelfren at 2025-03-19T18:02:56+00:00: Nice airdrop". "Nice" here is positive, so that's a positive sentiment.

"hazzo12 at 2025-03-19T17:10:05+00:00: Ded coin. Don't even look at it". "Ded" is probably slang for "dead". The phrase is advising against looking at it, which sounds negative.

"osmosis_news at 2025-03-19T16:58:18+00:00: Updates from the Lab starting in a few minutes! [link]". This is an announcement about updates. Neutral unless there's an opinion expressed, but here it's just informing, so neutral.

"dhomart at 2025-03-19T16:08:34+00:00: Nobody will make a new project with "cosmos EVM", if even the original EVMOS can't survive". The user is expressing doubt about new projects because EVMOS didn't survive. Negative sentiment.

"BasementNodes at 2025-03-19T15:31:50+00:00

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's any explicit or implicit action suggested.

Starting with the first message from mikebarb at 20:06:57. He mentions checking out two URLs: Go.skip.build and app.squidrouter.com. That seems like an action item because he's suggesting looking into those links, maybe for information or use. So that's one to note.

Next, xcryptoempereor asks if there's a bridge from ERC20 (Avax/Arb) to Cosmos/Osmo. The question itself isn't an action, but it's a request for information. However, the response might lead to an action, but since there's no answer provided here, maybe just noting the question as a next step for someone else to address.

Kartoffelfren says "Nice airdrop." That's a comment, not an action. Similarly, hazzo12's "Ded coin. Don't even look at it" is an opinion, not an action. 

osmosis_news shares an update link about Lab updates starting soon. The link is provided, so maybe the action here is to attend or check the update. But the message itself is just sharing the link; the action would be for others to visit it.

dhomart comments that nobody will make a new project with "cosmos EVM" since EVMOS didn't survive. BasementNodes replies "only takes 1 idiot though." Not sure if that's an action, maybe a sarcastic remark. Not sure if actionable.

mikebarb's message about success rate of asks being less than 0.1% is a question or a thought, not an action. BasementNodes' "giving some recognition for a good project that failed" is analysis, not action.

dhomart's "It was more like a robbery than acquire" refers to a previous discussion about EVMOS. Again, opinion, not action.

osmosis_statbot provides a support site link. That's a resource, so maybe an action item for users needing help to visit the site.

MLIzi's messages about ATOM acquiring OSMO like EVMOS, and others going to zero, are speculative statements. Unless someone is planning to act on
