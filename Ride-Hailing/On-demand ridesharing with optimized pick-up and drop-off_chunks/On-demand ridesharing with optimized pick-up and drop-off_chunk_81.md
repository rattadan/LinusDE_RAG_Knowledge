**Original Text:**

Results in Table 6 reveal that in this real-life case the on-demand ridesharing system improves significantly when PUDO points are
optimized jointly with assignments and routes. In all the three scenarios, both users and operators are better-off (on average) due to the
walks. Again, the most relevant impact is on rejections, which are reduced in more than four fifths in the first two scenarios, and in
almost nine tenths in the last one. Average waiting time can increase or decrease and in small amounts, while average delay decreases. The reduction in the number of rejections and in the total delay is expected, as some relevant detours can now be eliminated, which
also induces a strong decrease in VHT (with the exception of the last scenario, in which VHT is not part of the objective function).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk focuses on discussing the results from a research study that investigated how optimizing PUDO points together with assignments and routes can improve an on-demand ridesharing system. The context provided includes:

1. **Technical details**: The reference list discusses various aspects of ridesharing systems, including rebalancing strategies, modeling and mathematical frameworks, optimization heuristics, simulation, and service design.
2. **Connection to surrounding context**: This text builds upon the existing discussion by presenting a specific research study that explores the benefits of optimizing PUDO points in conjunction with assignments and routes. The study aims to improve efficiency and user satisfaction in ridesharing systems.
3. **Specific requirements and conditions**: None mentioned, but it can be inferred that the research study was conducted on real-life cases (e.g., Table 6), which meets the stated context.

The specific chunk is explaining the results from a research study that investigated how optimizing PUDO points together with assignments and routes can improve an on-demand ridesharing system. The key takeaways are:

* The optimization of Pudo points jointly with assignments and routes can significantly reduce rejections (from 4/5 to >90%) and average waiting time.
* Reducing rejections leads to a decrease in total delay, but may cause slight increases or decreases in VHT (depending on the scenario).
* Eliminating relevant detours can induce significant improvements in VHT.
