Putting this tweet in the context of his intentions:
This tweet appears designed to establish credibility and attract attention to Devoncnp's methods for generating income quickly through online business. By making an extreme claim (starting with nothing and reaching significant income in less than a month), he's attempting to demonstrate the effectiveness of his approach while also generating interest in his content. This is typical of influencers who monetize through selling courses, coaching or consulting services, where they need to establish authority to attract paying clients.
