**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you've provided a text that is a part of a research article or a publication, specifically an abstract or introduction to the article. Here's a breakdown:

- The text begins with "This" indicating a quotation or a reference.
- It then states that it is about an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.
- The next section explains what type of article it is (open access, which means anyone can read and download the content without paying for it).
- It mentions various terms related to transportation and mobility (ride-hailing, modal shift, shared autonomous vehicles, service area design, pricing, demand responsive transit, agent-based simulation).
- The text also lists keywords associated with these topics.

The next section is an introduction or a problem statement that is not explicitly stated in the provided snippet. It seems this part of the article would outline the purpose and significance of studying these topics related to transportation and mobility.
