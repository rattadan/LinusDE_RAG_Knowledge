Personal injury protection/medical payments coverage: Known as PIP or MedPay, depending on whether you live in an at-fault or no-fault state, these coverages pay for your and your passengers’ medical bills. PIP also includes coverage for lost wages and childcare. Collision coverage: Collision insurance covers your car’s damages in either accidents you caused or accidents where the other party’s property damage coverage limits were too low to cover your car’s losses. Comprehensive coverage: This coverage pays for any damages to your car that aren’t caused by collisions, which includes theft, vandalism, inclement weather, and more. How Can I Get Rideshare Insurance? A rideshare driver can find rideshare insurance by adding a rideshare endorsement to their existing policy (assuming their current insurance provider offers it).
