### Document Overview  
This content outlines the structure of a transaction message in Solana, detailing the components such as message headers, account addresses, instructions, signatures, and related technical specifications.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Message Header**: Specifies the number of signers and read-only accounts.  
- **Account Addresses**: Array of accounts required by instructions, with 32-byte entries.  
- **Recent Blockhash**: Timestamp for the transaction, stored as 32 bytes.  
- **Instructions**: Array of instructions to execute, referencing account keys via indexes.  
- **Signatures**: 64-byte array of signatures for required signers.  
- **Program ID Index**: U8 index pointing to a programâ€™s address in the account addresses array.  
- **Account Indexes**: Array of u8 indexes referencing accounts in the instruction data.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Message Format**: The header (3 bytes) + account keys (32 bytes each) + recent blockhash (32 bytes) + instructions (variable length).  
- **Signature Encoding**: Signatures are 64 bytes each, stored as a compact-u16 array for efficiency.  
- **Instruction Data**: Includes the program ID index (u8) and account indexes (u8 array) to reference accounts.  
- **Transaction Timestamp**: Recent blockhash acts as a timestamp, preventing duplicate transactions.  
- **Signer Requirements**:  
  - **Required Signatures**: Array of account addresses signed by transaction authors.  
  - **Read-Only Accounts**: Separately listed for signers (writable) or non-signers (read-only).  
  - **Program ID Index**: Specifies the program to execute instructions.  

### Related Topics  
- **Transaction Structure**: Links to how transactions are parsed and validated in Solana.  
- **Account Addresses**: Connects to the broader topic of account management in Solana.  
- **Program Instructions**: References the role of program IDs in executing transactions.

```
array of signatures included on the transaction.
- Message:
List of instructions to be processed atomically.
- Message Header: Specifies the number
of signer and read-only account.
- Account Addresses: An
array of account addresses required by the instructions on the transaction.
- Recent Blockhash: Acts as a
timestamp for the transaction.
- Instructions: An array of
instructions to be executed.
- Signatures: 64 bytes each
- Message: Header (3 bytes), account keys (32 bytes each), recent blockhash (32
bytes), and instructions
- Required signatures
- Number of read-only signed accounts
- Number of read-only unsigned accounts
- The array length (encoded ascompact-u16)
- The array items listed one after another
- Accounts that are writable and signers
- Accounts that are read-only and signers
- Accounts that are writable and not signers
- Accounts that are read-only and not signers
- Acts as a timestamp
- Prevents duplicate transactions
- Program ID Index: An u8 index that points to the program's address in the
account addresses array. This specifies the program that will process the
instruction.
- Account Indexes: An array of u8 indexes that point to the account addresses
required for this instruction.
- Instruction Data: A byte array specifying which instruction to invoke on the
program and any additional data required by the instruction (eg. function
arguments).
- header: Specifies read/write and signer privileges for addresses in theaccountKeysarray
- accountKeys: Array of all account addresses used in the transaction's
instructions
- recentBlockhash: Blockhash used to timestamp the transaction
- instructions: Array of instructions to execute. EachaccountandprogramIdIndexin an instruction references theaccountKeysarray by
index.
- signatures: Array including signatures for all accounts required as signers
by the instructions on the transaction. A signature is created by signing the
transaction message using the corresponding private key for an account.
