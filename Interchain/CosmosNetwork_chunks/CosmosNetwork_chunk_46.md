## CosmosNetwork - Chunk 46

**Document Summary:**

This overview provides an excellent foundation for understanding Tendermint Core's architecture and its Application Binary Interface (ABCI). Let's break down the key components and their functionalities:

### 1. **Tendermint Core**
   - **Role**: Responsible for consensus, validation, and block propagation.
   - **Components**:
     - **Block Proposal**: Proposes new blocks based on transaction data.
     - **Commit Vote**: Collects votes from validators to finalize a block.
     - **Consensus Logic**: Implements BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) logic.

### 2. **ABCI Interface**
   - **Purpose**: Allows the application logic to interact with Tendermint Core.
   - **Primary Messages**:
     - **AppendTx**: Delivers transactions for validation and inclusion in blocks.
     - **CheckTx**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block (optional).
     - **Commit**: Computes cryptographic commitments of the current state.

### 3. **Application Logic**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Validate and process transactions.
     - Update application state based on transaction outcomes.
     - Respond to ABCI messages with appropriate responses.
     - Handle consensus-related tasks like reorg-proposals (if necessary).

### Detailed Breakdown

#### **AppendTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Delivers a transaction for validation and inclusion in the blockchain.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core receives a new transaction via the network.
  2. The transaction is passed to the application via `AppendTx`.
  3. Application validates the transaction against its state, protocol rules, and credentials.
  4. If valid, the application updates its internal state (e.g., UTXO database).
  5. Tendermint Core schedules the transaction for inclusion in a block.

#### **CheckTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core's mempool first checks each transaction with `CheckTx`.
  2. If the transaction passes, it is relayed to other peers for further validation.
  3. Validated transactions are then passed to application via `AppendTx` for state updates.

#### **Commit Message**
- **Purpose**: Computes a cryptographic commitment of the current application state.
- **Flow**:
  1. After processing all transactions in a block, Tendermint Core computes the commit state.
  2. This commit is signed by validators based on their voting power.
  3. The commit is then included in the next block header.

### Additional Features

#### **Validator Set Management**
- **Messages**: `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock`.
- **Purpose**:
  - `BeginBlock`: Passed to application at the start of each block, allowing it to update its state.
  - `EndBlock`: Passed after transactions have been processed, enabling finalization actions like reorg-proposal signing.

#### **Lightweight Client Support**
- **Commit Hashes**: Signed by validators, providing cryptographic proof of committed states.
- **Merkle Proofs**: Simplify verification for lightweight clients using block hashes and signed commit votes.

### Handling Byzantine Faults

1. **Forks**:
   - ≥ ⅓ Byzantine voting power can cause forks.
   - Detectable through inconsistencies in the state root, triggering social consensus mechanisms to heal the network.

2. **Censorship Attacks**:
   - > ⅔ Byzantine voting power can commit arbitrary invalid states.
   - Social consensus and legal measures are necessary for handling such failures.

3. **Reorg-Proposal Coordination**:
   - Signed by +½ of original validators, ensuring that external coordination is robust to network partitions.

### Conclusion
ABCI provides a flexible interface for integrating application logic with Tendermint Core’s consensus mechanism. By carefully validating transactions and updating state, applications can ensure consistency and reliability in blockchain operations. The ability to handle Byzantine faults through social consensus mechanisms further strengthens the overall system's resilience.

**Original Text:**

Zones can also serve as blockchain-backed versions of enterprise and government systems, where pieces of a particular service that are traditionally run by an organization or group of organizations are instead run as a ABCI application on a certain zone, which allows it to inherit the security and interoperability of the public Cosmos network without sacrificing control over the underlying service. Thus, Cosmos may offer the best of both worlds for organizations looking to utilize blockchain technology but who are wary of relinquishing control completely to a distributed third party. Network Partition Mitigation
Some claim that a major problem with consistency-favouring consensus algorithms like Tendermint is that any network partition which causes there to be no single partition with >⅔ voting power (e.g. ≥⅓ going offline) will halt consensus altogether.

**Context Connection and Building Upon:**

The current text chunk connects to the surrounding context by explaining the concept of Tendermint Core's role in consensus, validation, and block propagation within the broader framework of blockchain technology. The introduction of Zones as a blockchain-backed version of enterprise or government systems serves to expand the discussion on BFT mechanisms.

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing additional insights into the potential applications and benefits of using Zones with Tendermint Core's ABCI interface.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no explicit requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk. However, it is implied that organizations seeking to utilize blockchain technology but are wary of relinquishing control will appreciate the concept of Zones as a blockchain-backed version of their existing systems.
