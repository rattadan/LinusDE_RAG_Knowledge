## Chunk 23

**Original Text:**

Confirmation
After a passenger broadcasts an "Acceptance" message to nearby drivers, the driver whose proposal was selected will receive the message and use the provided escrow ID to check the passengerâ€™s deposit in the escrow account. If the deposit is confirmed, the driver must then send their own deposit to the same escrow
account before sending a "Confirmation" message to the passenger. This process helps to ensure that both parties have a stake in the transaction and are committed to following
through with the ride request. By requiring both the passenger and the driver to send deposits to the escrow
account, the NRIDE ecosystem ensures that there is a mutual agreement and incentive to complete the ride. Confirmation {
String id;
String source;
String acceptanceID;
}

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It looks like you've provided a snippet of code from an open-source project or documentation related to Near Ride In Demand (NRIDE). 

However, I can still help with your question about the confirmation process mentioned in the text.

Based on the given information, it seems that the confirmation process involves two steps:

1. The passenger broadcasts an "Acceptance" message to nearby drivers.
2. Each driver checks their escrow ID and if successful, sends a deposit to the same escrow account before sending a "Confirmation" message back to the passenger.

The confirmation of the ride request is handled through the escrow ID, which ensures that both parties have a stake in the transaction and are committed to following through with the ride.
