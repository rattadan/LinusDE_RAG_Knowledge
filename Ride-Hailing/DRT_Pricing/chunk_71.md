5. Conclusion and Outlook
For Berlin, the simulation results have shown that a small service area and too low prices may result in an unwanted
mode shift effect from walk and bicycle to DRT. In order to design a DRT concept which yields a reduction in car trips,
the service area should not be limited to the city-center area, and rather cover a typical commuting area. In addition,
the pricing scheme should have a relatively high minimum fee in order to make the DRT mode less attractive for shortdistance travelers who may as well walk or take the bicycle without facing any high additional costs. The simulation
experiments have also shown that even for a city-wide DRT service area and a minimum fee of 3.00 EUR, without
car tolling only 11% of the DRT users are shifted from the car mode.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you're presenting a conclusion and outlook on the simulation results related to designing a Distance-Reduced Transit (DRT) system for Berlin. Here's a summary and analysis:

**Key findings:**

1. A small service area is preferred to avoid unwanted mode shift effects from walking or cycling to DRT.
2. The pricing scheme should have a relatively high minimum fee to make the DRT mode less attractive for short-distance travelers who can walk or cycle without additional costs.

**Simulation results:**

1. Even with a city-wide DRT service area and a minimum fee of 3.00 EUR, only 11% of users are shifted from car trips.
2. Car tolling is not sufficient to reduce the mode shift effect to less than 10%.

**Conclusion and outlook:**

Based on these findings, it appears that designing a DRT system for Berlin would require:

1. A larger service area to mitigate unwanted mode shift effects.
2. A more stringent pricing scheme with higher minimum fees to make the DRT mode less attractive for short-distance travelers.

The simulation results suggest that implementing car tolling alone is not enough to reduce the mode shift effect, indicating a need for a comprehensive approach involving the design of the service area and pricing scheme.

**Future research directions:**

1. Investigating the impact of different service area sizes on the mode shift effect.
2. Examining the effectiveness of alternative pricing schemes, such as dynamic pricing or time-of-use pricing.
3. Analyzing the economic and social implications of implementing a DRT system in Berlin, including its potential benefits and drawbacks.

By exploring these research directions, researchers and policymakers can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in designing effective DRT systems and make more informed decisions about their implementation.
