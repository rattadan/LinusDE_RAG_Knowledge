Contextual analysis:
This tweet appears to be part of a pattern of sharing philosophical perspectives that position life or reality as something fluid and uncertain.

This kind of thinking aligns with scientific methodology as well as certain philosophical schools that emphasize process over fixed outcomes.

The tweet doesn't appear to be promoting anything specific, but rather sharing a worldview that frames experiences and knowledge as provisional and subject to revision. This could be intended to provoke thought in followers or to express the author's personal philosophy.
