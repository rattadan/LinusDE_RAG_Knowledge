## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 20

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

**Original Text:**

Travel times within public transport (PT) mode result from
walking times from and to the transit stop, waiting times and in-vehicle times based on the schedule. In this simulation
setup, buses and tramways do not interact with DRT vehicles, private cars or bicycles. The walk, bicycle and ride
mode are simulated in a simplified way, i.e. teleported from one activity to the next one. That is, transport users do
not interact with each other or users of other modes. For walk and bicycle, the travel times are computed based on
a mode-specific speed (walk: 4 km/h; bicycle: 12 km/h) and a trip distance resulting from the beeline distance and a
beeline distance factor (walk: 1.5; bicycle: 1.4). For ride, the travel time is computed based on the least cost network
route taking into consideration the congested car travel time. Choice dimensions. All transport users are allowed to change their transport routes, departure times and modes of
transportation. For each sub-tour, i.e.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I'd be happy to analyze this specific section of text.

**1. Technical details:**
The technical details mentioned in this chunk include:

* The use of MATSim as an agent-based transport simulation framework.
* The specific parameters and processes used:
	+ Mode-specific speed (walk: 4 km/h, bicycle: 12 km/h).
	+ Trip distance resulting from the beeline distance and a beeline distance factor.
	+ Least cost network route considering congested car travel time.

**2. Context connection:**
This chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

* Introducing MATSim as an agent-based transport simulation framework, which is likely used for simulating dynamic transport services in Berlin.
* Providing background information on shared autonomous vehicles (AVs) and ride-sharing fleets, highlighting the importance of simulating AV mobility services.

**3. Requirements and conditions:**
The specific requirements mentioned include:

* The need to simulate walk, bicycle, and ride modes within a simulation setup that doesn't interact with each other or users of other modes.
* The requirement for transport users to change their routes, departure times, and modes of transportation (e.g., walking vs. biking).
* The need to consider congested car travel time when computing the least cost network route.

These requirements are crucial for developing a realistic simulation model that accurately represents the complexities of shared autonomous vehicles in urban areas.
