## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary of all these tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem. I need to focus on key points and decisions. Hmm, first, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is about the Proto-vision of Sputnik App looking beautiful. Maybe that's a design update or a new app release. Then there's a job posting for a Fractional CFO at Regen Network. That's important for their financial strategy. 

Next, $LUNA: The Fat Octopus Protocol. Not sure what that refers to, but maybe it's a new feature or project related to LUNA. Sputnik Network's roadmap for 2021-2022 is another key point, indicating their plans. The airdrop for $LUNA holders is a direct announcement about token distribution.

The StakeDrop form for those who didn't receive it is about addressing issues with a previous airdrop. Persistence's Meme Week seems like a community engagement event. Certik's Telegram AMA with Berry Data is an upcoming event, same with the KAVA AMA. 

OmniFlixNetwork's weekly update and their 24x7 broadcast automation shows operational progress. Akash and Solana's partnership is a collaboration highlight. e-Money's changes to treasury delegations relate to governance adjustments. Secret Network's multichain privacy announcement is a technical development. 

The daily and weekly stats are regular updates. Kava's Coinbase Rosetta API integration and the giveaway are significant for their platform. $FET being featured as a top AI coin is a recognition point. The last tweet is a general positive statement about the ecosystem.

I need to group similar items and highlight the main decisions and announcements. Let me categorize them: product updates (Sputnik, OmniFlix), job postings (Regen CFO), governance (Anchor proposals, e-Money), events (AMA, Meme Week), partnerships (Akash-Solana), token-related (airdrop, StakeDrop, $FET recognition), technical developments (Kava API, Secret Network), and stats. Also, the Kava giveaway tied to the API completion.

Make sure to mention each key point without getting bogged down in details. Keep it concise. Check dates to ensure all are within the same timeframe. The user probably wants a quick overview of what's happening in the Cosmos ecosystem without reading each

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the key topics. I'll start by reading each entry carefully. 

The first tweet mentions "Proto-vision of Sputnik App" and "Looks beautiful!" So the main topic here is Sputnik App's proto-vision. 

Next, there's a tweet about Regen Network looking for a FRACTIONAL CFO. That's a job announcement, so the topic is Fractional CFO for Regen Network.

Another tweet talks about $LUNA: The Fat Octopus Protocol. The main topic here is the Fat Octopus Protocol related to LUNA.

Then, Sputnik Network's Roadmap for 2021-2022. That's straightforward‚Äîroadmap details.

There's an AirDrop for $LUNA-holders. So AirDrop for LUNA holders is a topic.

A StakeDrop form for those who haven't received it. This is about StakeDrop claims.

Persistence's Meme Week. That's a promotional event.

An AMA with Certik and Berry Data on Telegram. AMAs are common in crypto, so the topic is Telegram AMA with Certik and Berry Data.

OmniFlixNetwork's weekly update. Weekly updates are routine, but important to note.

Another AMA with KAVA's Head of Engineering, Kevin Davis. So, AMA with Kevin Davis from KAVA.

Kava integrating Coinbase Rosetta API. Integration announcements are key for partnerships.

New proposals on Anchor. Governance or project proposals.

Akash and Solana collaboration. Mentioning they're friends implies a partnership.

OmniFlix's 24x7 automated broadcast. Operational update.

e-Money changing automated treasury delegations. Policy or technical changes.

Secret Network's multichain privacy launch in 8 days. Upcoming feature.

Daily and Weekly Cosmos Stats. These are reports or analytics.

Coinbase Rosetta Completion Giveaway by Kava Labs. Promotional event.

$FET featured as top AI crypto. Recognition in a category.

Lastly, a positive statement about the Cosmos Ecosystem. This is more general, but the main topic would be appreciation for the ecosystem.

Now, I need to make sure each topic is concise

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the sentiment of a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. The possible sentiments are positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. Let me start by reading them carefully.

The first tweet mentions "Proto-vision of Sputnik App. Looks beautiful!" The phrase "looks beautiful" is clearly positive, so that one is positive. 

Next, "Regen Network look for FRACTIONAL CFO". This is a job announcement, so it's more informational. Unless there's a negative connotation in "fractional" here, which I don't think so, it's neutral. 

Then, "$LUNA: The Fat Octopus Protocol". Just a statement about a protocol, no obvious sentiment words. Neutral again. 

"Sputnik Network announce Roadmap for 2021-2022". Announcing a roadmap is a neutral event, unless the roadmap itself has positive or negative aspects, but the tweet doesn't indicate that. Neutral. 

"AirDrop for $LUNA-holders". Airdrops are usually positive for holders, but the tweet itself is just stating the event. Maybe neutral, but sometimes airdrops are seen as positive news. Hmm, but since there's no explicit positive language, maybe neutral. 

"If you believe you should have received StakeDrop, but have not, please fill in the form". This seems like a customer service message. It's addressing an issue, so it's neutral. Not negative because it's offering a solution. 

"Persistence: Meme Week begins today!" Meme weeks are typically fun and positive. The exclamation mark adds to that. Positive. 

"June 8th, 9:30AM EST Join Certik for a Telegram AMA with Berry Data". Just announcing an event, so neutral. 

"OmniFlixNetwork's weekly update is here". Informational, neutral. 

"June 10th at 15:00 UTC AMA with KAVA's Head of Engineering Kevin Davis". Another event announcement, neutral. 

"Kava completes integration of Coinbase Rosetta API". Completion of integration is a positive achievement, but the tweet is straightforward. However, the use of "completes" might imply success, so positive. 

"New proposals on Anchor". New proposals could be

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. Each tweet has a timestamp, a mention of the account, the content, and a permalink.

First, I need to understand what action items, decisions, or next steps mean in this context. Action items are usually tasks that need to be done. Decisions are choices or agreements made. Next steps are the immediate actions following a decision or event. So, I should look for any mentions of events, deadlines, proposals, job searches, or specific tasks that someone might need to do.

Looking at each tweet:

1. "Proto-vision of Sputnik App. Looks beautiful!" ‚Äì This seems like an announcement of a new vision or prototype. Not an action item, just a statement.

2. "Regen Network look for FRACTIONAL CFO" ‚Äì Here, Regen Network is seeking a fractional CFO. That's a job opening, so an action item for someone to apply or take note of.

3. "$LUNA: The Fat Octopus Protocol" ‚Äì This is a statement about LUNA, maybe a new protocol. Not an action item.

4. "Sputnik Network announce Roadmap for 2021-2022" ‚Äì Announcing a roadmap. The roadmap itself might have steps, but the tweet is an announcement. Unless there's a specific task mentioned, maybe not an action item here.

5. "AirDrop for $LUNA-holders" ‚Äì An airdrop is happening. If there's a need to claim or participate, that's an action item. But the tweet just mentions the airdrop; maybe the holders need to do something. Wait, the user might need to check if they received it or take steps to claim. But the tweet here doesn't specify actions beyond the announcement.

6. "If you believe you should have received StakeDrop, but have not, please fill in the form" ‚Äì This is a clear action item. If someone hasn't received their StakeDrop, they need to fill a form.

7. "Persistence: Meme Week begins today!" ‚Äì Announcement of an event. Maybe participants need to engage, but unless there's a specific task, not sure.

8. "June 8th, 9:30AM EST Join Certik for a
