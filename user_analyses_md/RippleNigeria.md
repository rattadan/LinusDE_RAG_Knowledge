Putting tweets in bigger context of intentions:
The account appears to be part of a coordinated effort to promote MANTRA Chain ($OM) tokens. The tweets use hype language, make bold predictions, and retweet other promoters to create a sense of momentum and inevitability about the token's price increase. The account also suggests that there might be significant developments coming (like potential mergers/acquisitions) that could dramatically increase the token's value. The use of "You have been warned" language suggests an attempt to create a sense of exclusivity and insider knowledge.

The account name "RippleNigeria" might be misleading, as the content focuses on MANTRA rather than Ripple/XRP. This could be an attempt to leverage Ripple's brand recognition to gain followers for MANTRA promotion.
