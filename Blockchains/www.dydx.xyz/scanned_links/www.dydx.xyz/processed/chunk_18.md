### Document Overview  
This content explains Ethereum 2.0’s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), highlighting improvements in scalability, transaction speed, and gas fees, along with technical details about consensus mechanisms and execution layers.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: A consensus mechanism where nodes solve complex algorithms to validate transactions (used in Bitcoin).  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism where nodes lock cryptocurrency (stake) to validate transactions and earn rewards.  
- **Merge**: The transition from PoW to PoS in Ethereum 2.0, eliminating energy consumption and improving scalability.  
- **Transaction Processing**: PoS allows transactions to be processed in 12-second intervals, compared to PoW’s 13–14-second intervals.  
- **Gas Fees**: Reduced by 93% post-Merge, reflecting efficiency gains in the PoS model.  
- **Execution Layer vs. Consensus Layer**: The Ethereum Foundation prefers the execution layer (where transactions are processed) over the consensus layer (where rules are enforced).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Transaction Speed**: PoS enables 12-second transaction batches, significantly faster than PoW’s 13–14 seconds.  
- **Gas Fee Reduction**: Average Ethereum gas fees dropped by 93% between May and September 2022, demonstrating PoS’s efficiency.  
- **Staking Requirements**: Nodes lock ETH (stake) to validate transactions, with rewards tied to stake size.  
- **Execution Layer**: The PoS model is designed to scale further with software applications, enhancing flexibility for future upgrades.  

### Related Topics

Ethereum has had many upgrades throughout its history, but Ethereum 2.0âwhich began with âthe Mergeâ in 2022âfundamentally changes the blockchainâs core consensus mechanism. Think of the consensus mechanism as a set of rules computers must follow to process transactions and record data. Earlier, Ethereum used a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin. On PoW blockchains, computers (or nodes) solve complex algorithms every few minutes to post new transactions on the cryptocurrencyâs payment ledger and receive crypto rewards. The first milestone in the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap began with âthe Merge.â The Merge moved Ethereum from a PoW consensus mechanism to a Proof of Stake (Pos) consensus mechanism. Unlike PoW blockchains, a PoS systemâs nodes lock (or stake) cryptocurrency on the main blockchain to validate transactions and collect ETH as compensation.

Ethereum made this change primarily for scalability. Leading Ethereum developers such as Vitalik Buterin believe thePoS consensus model addresses issuessuch as slow transaction speeds, network congestion, and high gas fees on Ethereumâs blockchain. Reports on the average transaction costs following Ethereumâs transition to PoS suggest itâs already impacting ETH gas fees. For example, data from YCharts found the averageEthereum gas fees dipped by 93%between May and September 2022. The PoS Ethereum blockchain also confirms new batches of transactions in12-second intervalsversus the 13â14-second intervals of the older blockchain. The development team at the Ethereum Foundation believesPoS provides a better templateto enhance these efficiency benefits with further software applications.

Note:Although most publications use Ethereum 1.0 versus Ethereum 2.0 to describe the switch from PoW to PoS, theEthereum Foundationprefers the âexecution layerâ versus the âconsensus layer.
