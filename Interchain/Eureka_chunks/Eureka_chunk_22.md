## Eureka - Chunk 22

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

As a part of providing good user experiences for everyone using the API, we don’t enable users to bridge assets to new chains where no one has previously bridged that asset. (Often times, for ordinary users, taking an existing token to a chain it doesn’t exist leaves them stuck on that new chain with a useless token). That’s why we need to “warm start” channels — to enable recommending them as bridging routes. ​
3. Wait up to 24 hours and verify
Skip’s intelligent route detection should automatically detect new routes for all assets and chains that meet the above requirements in 4-8 hours. This will not happen immediately. Please ensure you wait the necessary amount of time. After you’ve let enough time pass, you can verify that Skip Go API supports the new routes you’ve configured using the /v2/fungible/recommend_assets endpoint.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the current text chunk:

**1. Technical details and parameters:**

* The IBC protocol is mentioned with specific rules for potential timeouts or slippage, as well as tokens being sent back to the source chain if issues arise.
* Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol) is also discussed, including potential slow relaying from Axelar and similar issues.
* Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP) relies on Circle's attestation service, which can lead to funds being inaccessible due to a service outage. Users will need to wait until the outage recovers before their funds are available.

**2. Contextual connection:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by explaining potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, highlighting common issues that may arise when bridging assets across different blockchain chains.

Specifically, this chunk is connected to the broader context of providing a comprehensive overview of key points and insights for users, developers, and administrators working with cross-chain applications. It underscores the importance of understanding potential risks and pitfalls in order to ensure user experiences are seamless and secure.

**3. Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

* The text mentions waiting up to 24 hours before verifying recommended channels using Skip's intelligent route detection.
* Ensuring users wait the necessary amount of time is emphasized as a critical step.
* Users will need to verify that their configured routes meet specific requirements and are supported by Skip Go API after waiting enough time.

Overall, this chunk provides technical details about potential issues in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, emphasizing the importance of understanding and mitigating risks associated with these applications.
