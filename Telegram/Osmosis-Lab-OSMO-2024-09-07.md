## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key points and decisions. The user wants a concise summary focusing on those.

Starting from the bottom, Cryptofantasista asks if Osmosis will save the cycle, with some emojis. Then user_7164487109 mentions Osmosis going far and seeing India on YouTube. There's a support link from osmosis_statbot. 

Businessbooster has questions about creating an account with Ledger, connecting hardware wallets, and using Keplr. Khuwarzmi provides links and info about Keplr and gas fees. 

mctokendegen is looking for a Telegram bot to track wallet transactions. GPKwee suggests cosmos_whalecat. Then there's a discussion about APY and APR calculations between GPKwee and northgs. 

IBCHERO asks about bridging SOL from Osmosis to Solana. BasementNodes and WorkerBee_3 discuss bridge options like Picasso, Wormhole, Composable, and portalbridge. They mention issues with liquidity and reliability. Martyvb talks about using alloyed pools for swaps and bridging with USDT. 

Other messages mention name changes, the Picasso bridge's performance, and some frustrations with bridge experiences. There's also a mention of a limit order and liquidity issues from profesija and kychuli.

So the key points are: support links, wallet setup with Ledger and Keplr, bridge options between Osmosis and Solana (Picasso, Wormhole, Composable), issues with liquidity and bridge reliability, APY/APR calculations, and the use of alloyed pools for better routes. Decisions or recommendations include using portalbridge despite issues, Picasso for SOL bridging, and cosmos_whalecat for transaction tracking. Also, needing alloy to be stable before certain actions.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, grouping similar topics together. Avoid mentioning every user's message but highlight the main discussions and resolutions.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user provided a list of chat messages from Osmosis, and they want the main topics as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to read through each message and identify recurring themes or subjects. Let me start by going through each line one by one.

The first line is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's about support resources. Then WorkerBee_3 mentions Picasso and name changes. Picasso here might be a project or a bridge. The chain name change is another point.

BasementNodes talks about changing the chain name and mentions low liquidity bridge tokens. WorkerBee_3 again refers to composable, which might be Composable Finance, a blockchain project. Martyvb discusses the Picasso bridge to SOL, alloyed pools, USDT.sol.pica, SOL.pica, and mentions wBTC.wh in BTC alloy. So bridging between chains, specific tokens, and alloyed pools are topics here.

WorkerBee_3 asks for a URL related to composable. Martyvb talks about bridging SOL via Picasso, which takes 7 minutes and is free. BasementNodes mentions liquidity issues, different bridges, and the problems with PortalBridge and Wormhole. They also discuss the experience with these bridges being frustrating.

IBCHERO asks about bridging SOL from Osmosis to Solana and the bridge not working. Then there's a discussion about using Ledger with Keplr, gas tokens (ATOM or OSMO), and creating accounts with Ledger. Khuwarzmi provides links to Keplr and explains gas payment in any token.

Profesija and kychuli talk about limit orders on Osmosis Dex, partial fills, and APR vs APY calculations. GPKwee explains APR and APY, and suggests a Telegram bot for transaction notifications.

Other messages include user_7164487109's cryptic messages with emojis and mentions of India on YouTube, which might be less relevant. Cryptofantasista asks if OSMO will save the cycle, which is a token-related question.

Putting this together, the main topics seem to be:

- Blockchain bridges (Picasso bridge, PortalBridge, Wormhole, Composable, IBC)
- Token swaps and liquidity (alloyed pools, USDT.sol.pica, SOL.pica, wBTC.wh)
- Wallet

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from Osmosis and other related channels. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's a positive, negative, or neutral tone.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's just a helpful message, so neutral. Then WorkerBee_3 says "because Picasso" and another message about name changes. Not sure if that's positive or negative yet. Maybe neutral?

BasementNodes mentions chain name changes. Again, neutral unless there's context. Then there's a discussion between martyvb and WorkerBee_3 about the Picasso bridge working well and being free. Words like "really well" and "cool" seem positive. So that part is positive.

WorkerBee_3 wonders if alloy will help liquidity. That's a question, so maybe neutral. Another message says "not till we have alloy running smooth" ‚Äì so maybe a bit negative about the current state? BasementNodes talks about low liquidity on bridge tokens, which is negative. 

Then there's a part where BasementNodes and WorkerBee_3 discuss Portalbridge and Wormhole. BasementNodes says Portalbridge is frustrating, fails often, but eventually works. That's negative. They also mention Wormhole app isn't good, which is negative. WorkerBee_3 suggests trying ibc.fun, but IBCHERO says the bridge doesn't work. Definitely negative.

Khuwarzmi and Businessbooster are talking about wallet support and setup. Khuwarzmi provides help, Businessbooster thanks them. That's positive. Then profesija and kychuli discuss limit orders and liquidity issues. kychuli mentions orders being filled at spot price and partial fills, which might be neutral or slightly negative. 

GPKwee and northgs talk about APR and APY calculations. GPKwee states total APR is less than 0.1%, which is negative if expecting higher returns. northgs seems confused about finding APY, which could be neutral. 

The last few messages from user_7164487109 and Cryptofantasista seem optimistic about Osmosis's future, using phrases like "I know osmosis can go far" and asking if Osmo will save the cycle with emojis. Those are positive.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any that indicate a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a next step in a process.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's more of an informational message, not an action item. Then WorkerBee_3 mentions Picasso, which might be a reference to a bridge or platform. Looking further, BasementNodes talks about chain name changes and liquidity issues. 

Martyvb suggests using alloyed pools for swapping and mentions adding wBTC.wh to the BTC alloy. That sounds like a next step or action item. WorkerBee_3 says they'll add a URL to their list, which is an action item. Martyvb also mentions the Picasso bridge working well, which could be a decision to use that bridge.

WorkerBee_3 wonders if alloy will catalyze liquidity movement, which is a consideration, not an action. BasementNodes and WorkerBee_3 discuss using portalbridge.com and wormhole, with BasementNodes indicating portalbridge is the go-to despite issues. That's a decision to use portalbridge. 

IBCHERO asks about bridging SOL, and BasementNodes mentions wormhole or composable, but not ideal. WorkerBee_3 suggests trying ibc.fun. Then there's a question about a Telegram bot for wallet tracking, and GPKwee recommends cosmos_whalecat. That's an action item to check that bot.

Businessbooster asks about creating an account with Ledger, and Khuwarzmi provides steps, which are action items. Also, Khuwarzmi mentions paying gas in any token on Osmosis, which is a decision point for users. 

Profesija and kychuli discuss limit orders and partial fills, which is more about understanding the system rather than an action. Northgs asks about APY calculation, and GPKwee explains APR vs APY, which is informational but not an action.

I need to compile all these. Action items would be things like "Visit support site", "Add specific URLs to list", "Consider adding tokens to alloys", "Use portalbridge", "Check Telegram bot", and "Steps for Ledger integration". Decisions include using Picasso bridge, portalbridge as
