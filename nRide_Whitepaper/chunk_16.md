## Chunk 16

**Original Text:**

If a driver receives a ride request with an "acceptedProposalID" field that does not match their own ID, it means that another driver has
already accepted the request, and the driver should disregard the request and wait for another one. RequestCancellation {
String id;
String source;
String requestID;
String acceptedProposalID;
}

2.2.3. Proposal
When a driver receives a ride request from a passenger, they have the option to send a "Proposal" back to
the sender of the request. The proposal typically includes information about the driver’s position, a proposed price for the ride, and the driver’s NRIDE address for setting up the escrow account. The NRIDE address is associated with a cryptocurrency wallet on the JUNO blockchain, which drivers use to send and receive NRIDE tokens when participating in the escrow mechanism for a ride request.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that if a driver receives a ride request with an "acceptedProposalID" field that does not match their own ID, it means that another driver has already accepted the request and is now proposing the ride.

This suggests that there might be some kind of proposal or bid system in place for accepting ride requests on your platform. When a driver accepts a request, they should typically receive a Proposal that includes information about the driver's position, proposed price, and their NRIDE address. The acceptedProposalID field would likely match the one assigned to them.

To implement this, you could modify the RequestCancellation class as follows:

```java
public class RequestCancellation {
    // existing fields...
    
    private String proposalId; // This should match the acceptedProposalID

    public void rejectRequest() {
        if (proposalId != null && proposalId.equals(acceptedProposalID)) {
            // The request has been cancelled, so discard it and continue processing other requests
            System.out.println("Request cancelled by driver with proposal ID: " + proposalId);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Error cancelling request: Proposal ID mismatch");
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation assumes that the acceptedProposalID field is unique to each driver, which might not be the case. If that's not the case, you would need to implement a more complex solution to match proposal IDs across drivers.

Additionally, you should also consider implementing a check to ensure that a driver has accepted multiple requests with different ProposalIDs before cancelling a request. This could prevent incorrect cancellations and maintain the integrity of your system.
