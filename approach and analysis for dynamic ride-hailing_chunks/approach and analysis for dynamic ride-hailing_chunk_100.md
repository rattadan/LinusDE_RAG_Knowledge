I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

We can rearrange that formula to keep the intermediate results as small
as necessary:

With these results and observations, researchers and fleet operators
can now better evaluate which solution approaches might be suitable
for their specific scenario. Therefore, we help to advance the study
of ride-hailing problems as well as contribute to the improvement of
real-world mobility-on-demand services. 14

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining a formula or mathematical equation used in dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.

The technical details mentioned are:

* The formula represents the approximate supply of vehicles (𝑠) that can be supplied at any given time, considering factors like demand (𝑑), vehicle capacity (k), and fuel efficiency (e−𝑑).
* The equation uses a series expansion to keep intermediate results as small as possible.

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by providing a mathematical framework for understanding dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems. It's also connected to the broader topic of simulation, modeling, and rebalancing strategies mentioned earlier.

The specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned are:

* The equation assumes a certain level of fuel efficiency (e−𝑑) and vehicle capacity (k), which may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
* The calculation involves summing up the product of demand (𝑑⋅𝑒 𝑘) over all possible values of k, which may not accurately represent the relationship between demand and supply in complex systems.
* The equation uses a series expansion to approximate the solution, but does not provide clear guidelines for its use or interpretation.
