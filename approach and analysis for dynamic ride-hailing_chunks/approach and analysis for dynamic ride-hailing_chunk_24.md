I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

We describe each state as a tuple 𝑠 = (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑠𝑟 , 𝑠𝑣 ). Here, 𝑠𝑡 is the current
time in seconds since the beginning of the current episode. Moreover,
𝑠𝑟 is a tuple containing the pending requests. Each entry corresponds to
one single pending request and holds the data about the request time,
the pickup and drop-off locations as well as the reward, as described
above. Lastly, 𝑠𝑣 is a tuple where each entry holds the data of one single
vehicle. Each vehicle has a current location, a state, and a set of already
scheduled jobs. The vehicle state is one of the following:

In the context of the MDP formulation, performing an action 𝑎 in
state 𝑠 leads to a reward 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎). Different objectives are considered
in the literature and in practical applications (see Table 1), with the
most common being maximizing the service rate or number of served
requests, minimizing customer waiting time, and maximizing overall
profit.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section appears to be describing the technical details of a model or simulation framework used for dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.

**Context:**

The surrounding text is discussing various references on the topic of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, including simulation and modeling, dynamic dispatch and repositioning, and rebalancing strategies. The current text chunk appears to be building upon this context by providing more detailed technical information about a specific model or framework.

**Technical details:**

The following are the exact technical details mentioned in this chunk:

* `𝑠 = (𝑠𝡔 , 𝑠𝞐 , 𝑠𝓎 )`: This is describing the state of each vehicle, which consists of:
	+ `𝑠𝡔`: Current time in seconds since the beginning of the current episode.
	+ `𝑠𝞐`: Pending requests (a tuple containing data about the request time, pickup and drop-off locations, and reward).
	+ `𝑠𝓎`: Vehicle state, which can be one of the following:
		- `In`: The vehicle is in a certain state.
* `𝑢 = (𝑦𝡔 , 𝑢𝞐 )`: This describes the objective or action taken by the model. In this context, the only action considered is a reward, which can be one of:
	+ `Maximize service rate`
	+ `Maximize served requests`
	+ `Minimize customer waiting time`
	+ `Maximize overall profit`

**Building upon the surrounding context:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding text by providing more technical information about a specific model or framework used for dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems. The references mentioned (e.g., Bischoff & Maciejewski, Braverman et al.) are likely related to simulation and modeling techniques that can be adapted for real-world applications.

**Requirements and conditions:**

There are no specific requirements or conditions mentioned in this chunk. However, the context suggests that the model or framework being described is suitable for use in ride-hailing systems with uncertain demand, which may require considerations such as robustness and adaptability to changing traffic patterns and other external factors.
