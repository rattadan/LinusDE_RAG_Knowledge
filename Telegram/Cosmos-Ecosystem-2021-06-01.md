## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user provided a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem on June 1, 2021, and some spam alerts. I need to focus on the key points and decisions.

First, looking at the tweets. The earliest ones are from 00:08 to 00:31. The main announcements here are about the Gravity Bridge deployment, which seems important because it's mentioned multiple times. Josh Lee is excited about it, so that's a highlight. Then there's the swap bridge for $FET tokens being back online, with a limit of 120 million to swap. Also, the Cosmos Ecosystem is giving away 1 $AKT each to two users who commented, which is a promotional or community engagement move.

Next, the Kava Swap as a liquidity hub bridging DeFi, blockchains, and financial services. That's a key partnership or product launch. Then, Starname's plan to burn $IOV tokens, requiring delegators and validators to prepare to vote. Burning tokens usually affects supply, so that's a significant decision.

Other mentions include OmniFlix Network enabling Telegram groups with SOL/SPL tokens, $XPRT listed on Live Coin Watch, a podcast episode on Akash, and a CoLearn product overview. The daily Cosmos Outpost from May 31 is a recurring update. Keplr helping with voting is about governance participation.

The later tweets (21:31 to 22:02) are more or less the same topics but maybe reiterating. Also, there are spam alerts for two users, which the user might want to note as security advisories.

I need to group these by themes. The main points are Gravity Bridge launch, FET token swap, AKT giveaway, Kava Swap, IOV token burn, other updates (OmniFlix, XPRT listing, Akash podcast, CoLearn), the daily outpost, and spam alerts. The decisions here are the token swap, the burn vote, the giveaways, and the spammer alerts. Also, Gravity Bridge deployment is a major event.

I should make sure to mention the key projects involved: Sifchain, Akash, Kava, Starname, Gravity Bridge, OmniFlix, XPRT, CoLearn. The dates might not be necessary unless the user wants to note the timeline, but the focus is on key points

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated list. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the key topics. Let me start by reading each one carefully.

The first tweet mentions Sifchain and Akash being friends. So the main topic here is the collaboration or partnership between Sifchain and Akash.

Next, there's a tweet about swapping $FET-erc20 to $FET-native. The key topic here is the token swap, specifically FET tokens from ERC20 to native.

Another tweet talks about Kava Swap as a liquidity hub bridging DeFi, blockchains, and financial services. So Kava Swap and its role in connecting different areas is a main topic.

Then there's a tweet about the deployment of Gravity Bridge on the Cosmos Hub. Gravity Bridge and its deployment are important here.

Josh Lee's tweet also mentions Gravity Bridge, indicating it's a significant announcement. So that's another mention of Gravity Bridge.

The Daily Cosmos Outpost from May 31st UTC seems to be a regular update or event, so that's a topic.

Keplr helping users vote points to governance participation, so Keplr and voting/governance.

A thank you message with a small gift from Cosmos Ecosystem might relate to community engagement or rewards, but maybe not a main topic unless it's recurring. But since it's mentioned once, perhaps just the gift as a topic.

There are alerts about spammers, but those are probably not part of the main topics related to Cosmos Ecosystem's projects. Unless the user wants to include them, but given the context, they might be irrelevant here.

Another tweet mentions sending 1 $AKT to those who commented on a specific post. This is about airdrops or rewards for participation, so $AKT airdrop.

Starname burning $IOV tokens and asking delegators and validators to vote. So token burning and governance for Starname.

A link to Episode 15 about Akash, which is likely part of an educational series. So Akash educational content or Akash series.

OmniFlix Network enabling Telegram token-gated groups with SOL/SPL tokens. The main topic here is OmniFlix Network's new feature.

$XPRT listed on Live Coin Watch, so new

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a bunch of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. Let me start by reading them carefully.

The first tweet says "Sifchain and Akash are friends!" That sounds friendly and positive. Maybe they're announcing a partnership or collaboration. The use of an exclamation mark adds enthusiasm.

Next, "Swap your $FET-erc20 to $FET-native". This is a call to action. It's neutral in tone but promoting a service. Not clearly positive or negative, just informative.

Third tweet: "Kava Swap - A Liquidity Hub Bridging DeFi, Blockchains, and Financial Services". Again, informative. It's stating what Kava Swap is, so neutral. But maybe the mention of bridging different areas could be seen as positive development.

Fourth: "Deployment of Gravity Bridge on the Cosmos Hub". Deployment of a new feature or project is generally a positive event, showing progress. But the tweet itself is factual, so maybe neutral, but the context implies positive.

Fifth: "Josh Lee: The moment we've all been waiting for is here - Gravity Bridge". The phrase "moment we've all been waiting for" is definitely positive, indicating excitement and anticipation.

Then, "Daily Cosmos Outpost May 31 UTC" ‚Äì this seems like a regular update, so neutral. 

"Keplr helps you to vote!" ‚Äì Encouraging participation, which is positive. It's empowering users, so likely positive.

"Thank you for your attention! This is small gift from the Cosmos Ecosystem to you)" ‚Äì Thank you messages and gifts are positive. The exclamation mark and the gesture of a gift convey appreciation.

The following tweets are alerts about spammers. Those are negative, as they warn about potential threats or issues.

Other tweets mention technical problems but keeping a promise, offering $AKT to commenters. The technical problem is negative, but compensating with a token gift is positive. The overall sentiment here might balance out, but the mention of remembering their promise after issues could be positive.

Another tweet about burning $IOV tokens. Burning tokens can be seen as positive because it often reduces supply, which might increase value. But the tweet is a call to action for voting, so maybe neutral with a

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text consists of multiple tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account on June 1, 2021. 

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. Starting with the most recent ones since they might have the latest updates. The first tweet mentions Sifchain and Akash being friends. That's probably just a promotional message, no action item there.

Next, there's a tweet about swapping $FET-erc20 to $FET-native. Another one says the bridge is working again and urges people to hurry because there's a limited amount to swap. So here, the action item is to swap tokens before the limit is reached. I need to note that.

Then there's a Kava Swap tweet, but it's described as a liquidity hub. Maybe that's an announcement rather than an action item. The Gravity Bridge deployment is mentioned, but again, unless there's a call to action, it's just info. However, another tweet says Josh Lee mentions Gravity Bridge, which might be the same thing. 

The Daily Cosmos Outpost and Keplr helping to vote could be reminders. The gift link might not require action unless recipients need to claim it, but the text doesn't specify steps beyond clicking a link. 

Looking further back, there's an alert about spammers. The action here is to ban them, but that's for the group admins, not general users. 

Another tweet mentions Starname burning $IOV tokens and asking delegators and validators to prepare to vote. That's a clear action item: prepare stake to vote. 

The $XPRT listing on Live Coin Watch is an announcement. The OmniFlix Network's Telegram token-gated groups with SOL/SPL tokens might require users to join, but the tweet doesn't explicitly say to do something. 

The CoLearn product suite overview and the Kava Labs (L)earn tweet might be informational. 

Wait, the tweet from 00:31:51 mentions sending 1 $AKT to those who commented on a specific post. AdrianStarr108 and akkumare are mentioned and told to send their akash addresses. So the action items here are for those two users to provide their addresses to receive the AKT. 

Also, the tweet from 00:
