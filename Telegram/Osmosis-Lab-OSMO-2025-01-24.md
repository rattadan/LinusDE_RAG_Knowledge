## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages.

First, I'll scan through the text to identify important information. The osmosis_statbot and osmosis_news messages seem to be about official links and support. There's a mention of a scam involving Astrovault with a phishing link, and users are warned not to click on it. BasementNodes and Svansy have some casual banter, which might not be crucial. 

Then, there's a user asking about earning interest on USDC with dapps, specifically Mars protocol or Nolus. Another part is about Keplr app issues on Android and checking if blocklists work on mobile. Domashno reports a dust attack with specific URLs, and mikebarb suggests mentioning it to Keplr. 

KaiArne90 had an issue with an unexpected transaction approval, and others are discussing EVs and crypto payments. I need to make sure the summary includes the scams, official links, dapp inquiries, and technical issues with Keplr. Also, note the governance and community links provided by the bot.

I should structure the summary to highlight the main points: scams/phishing warnings, official resources, user inquiries about dapps, technical issues reported, and the discussion on security measures. Avoid the casual chat unless it's relevant. Make sure each key point is clear and decisions like not clicking links, visiting support sites, or checking blocklists are emphasized.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Scams/Phishing Alerts:**  
   - Users warned about fake Astrovault airdrops (transactions with 0.000001 OSMO and malicious memos linking to *astrovault.network* and *astrovault.ink*). Advised **not to click the links**.  
   - Domashno requests blocking these URLs in Keplr; mikebarb suggests reporting to Keplr.  

2. **Official Resources:**  
   - Osmosis provides support via [support.osmosis.zone](https://support.osmosis.zone) and a Discord server ([discord.gg/osmosis](https://discord.gg/osmosis)).  
   - Keplr blocklist functionality is confirmed for desktop but questioned for mobile apps (jasbanza).  

3. **User Inquiries:**

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user provided a list of chat messages from various users, mostly related to Osmosis, a blockchain platform. My task is to go through these messages and identify the main topics, then list them separated by commas.

First, I'll start by reading through each message to understand the context. The first few messages are from osmosis_statbot and BasementNodes. The statbot mentions visiting the support site and providing official links. BasementNodes says "just like #links" and another message about a chat bleach command. Then there's a message from Svansy greeting the SEI CEO. 

Looking at the official links, they include links to the app, docs, support, social media, Discord, Telegram groups, GitHub, and wallet providers like Keplr. So maybe "Official Links" is a topic here. Also, the support site is mentioned multiple times, so "Support Resources" could be another.

Then there's a user asking about Mars protocol or Nolus, and another about dapps to earn interest on USDC. These seem related to "DApps and Protocols" and "Earning Interest on USDC". 

Another user, jasbanza, talks about using Google Pay with crypto, EVs, and questions about Keplr's blocklist. So topics here might be "Crypto Payment Integration" and "Keplr Wallet Security". There's also a mention of a phishing site and blocklist in Keplr, which ties into security concerns.

There's a message about an airdrop scam involving Astrovault, which is a phishing attempt. So "Airdrop Scams and Phishing" would be a topic. Another user mentions a dust attack with specific URLs, so "Dust Attacks and Security Threats" as well.

The conversation also includes discussions about joining the Discord community, so "Community Engagement" could be a topic. Additionally, there's a mention of governance forums and GitHub repositories, which might relate to "Governance and Development".

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other topics. Let me go through each message again. 

- osmosis_statbot: Support site and official links. So "Support Resources" and "Official Links".
- BasementNodes: #links, bleach command. Maybe "Community Channels" or "Discord Commands".
- Svansy: Greeting SEI CEO.

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- https (24 mentions)
- osmosis (14 mentions)
- support (12 mentions)
- com (11 mentions)
- keplr (9 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from Osmosis, and they want me to determine the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. First, I need to go through each message and see what the tone is.

Starting with the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot telling people to visit the support site. That's straightforward and neutral. Then another statbot message about official links. Definitely neutral as well. Then BasementNodes says "seiloooooooor lol" which seems like a casual, maybe positive comment with the "lol" indicating humor. Svansy responds with "oh hello SEI CEO ü§ó" ‚Äì the emoji here is friendly, so positive.

Next, another statbot message with links again, neutral. The_liquidator115 asks for the official Discord, and statbot provides it. Neutral. Then jasbanza has a series of messages. He mentions an EV, being a tester, and says "Sweet. Nice to see they're still doing things." The word "sweet" and "nice" are positive. He also talks about checking a pinned message, which is neutral. Later, he warns about a phishing site and a scam transaction. That's a negative point because it's a security concern. 

Kamal_Maquina says the in-app browser works, which is positive. Then there's a discussion about Keplr's blocklist and whether it works on mobile. The user is asking questions, so neutral. Domashno reports a dust attack with phishing links, which is negative. mikebarb and KaiArne90 discuss a transaction that might be a scam. KaiArne90 says he approved a small transaction accidentally, which is a negative event. mikebarb offers help, which is positive.

Looking at the overall, there are several neutral messages from the bots providing links. The user interactions have a mix: some positive like welcoming, offering help, and acknowledging updates. But there's also negative sentiment around scams, phishing, and security issues. The negative parts are more concerning because they involve potential harm to users. However, the positive and neutral messages are also present. 

I need to weigh these. The negative messages are from users reporting problems and warnings. The positive ones are from users engaging with the community and support. Since there are multiple instances of security warnings and scams mentioned, which are serious,

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat log. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see if there's anything that requires action or is a decision made.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot at 21:59:17. It's just a support link, so maybe not an action item unless someone needs to visit it. But since it's a bot message, maybe it's a reminder or a standard response. Not sure if that's an action item.

Next, osmosis_news at 21:20:58 shares a link. That's probably just a news update, not an action item. Then BasementNodes at 21:02:46 says "seiloooooooor lol" ‚Äì seems like a casual message, no action here. Svansy at 21:02:16 responds with a greeting to SEI CEO, which is also just a comment.

Looking at the osmosis_statbot message at 21:01:53. It lists a bunch of official links. Again, this might be information but unless someone is told to do something with these links, maybe not an action item. The user BasementNodes mentions "just like #links" ‚Äì maybe they're referring to a previous channel or topic, but not a next step.

Then there's a message about a chat bleach command. Not sure what that is, but maybe a user is asking about a command. Svansy apologizes for the "great wall of command" ‚Äì perhaps indicating they sent a lot of text, but not an action item. BasementNodes asks who told them about the command, which is a question but not an action step.

The osmosis_news earlier at 19:49:45 shares another link. Khuwarzmi at 18:36:08 shares a link to a tweet. Yusungsang at 18:35:53 says they pressed confirm, maybe confirming something but not clear what. xandrejjason at 18:34:25 asks if anyone on Android Keplr had an issue, so maybe a support request.

User_5684546241 at 13:58:25 asks about Mars protocol or N
