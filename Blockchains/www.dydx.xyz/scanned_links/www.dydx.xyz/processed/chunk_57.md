as crypto price charts may appear, traders use them daily to place orders in the crypto market. They use technical tools to reveal critical price levels and patterns in their target cryptocurrencyâs chart.

Here are the basic tools for reading crypto charts to predict future prices, manage risk, and make informed decisions. But first, letâs understand a crypto price chartâs fundamentals.

A crypto price chart is a graph with detailed information on a cryptocurrencyâs past and present trading activity. And most have time frames (such as hours, days, or weeks) on the horizontal axis and prices (typically quoted in U.S. dollars) on the vertical axis. There are two primary ways charts represent a cryptocurrencyâs average price:

Of these two patterns, line graphs are more intuitive to read, while candlestick charts include more details.

Crypto traders access more data points by adjusting the average times on candlestick charts and analyzing each block of trading history. Because candlesticks give traders a clearer glimpse into trading activity on multiple time frames, crypto traders prefer these over line charts when analyzing the marketplace.

Price charts help traders visualize the historical and current asset price activity, such as cryptocurrencies. Although analyzing past trading data canât guarantee future price performance, short-term traders use these charts to develop trading strategies, set indicators, and open or close their positions.

In fact, thereâs an entire field of market research called technical analysis dedicated to studying chart data. Unlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis relies on chart patterns, statistics, and trendlines to predict future prices and set up trades. While a fundamental crypto analyst researches a coinâs history, network activity, and circulating supply, technical analysts use charting tools to pinpoint the best prices to enter and exit a trade.
