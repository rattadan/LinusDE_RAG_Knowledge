## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the key points. The main issues seem to be around Picasso assets and the Solana bridge. Users are having problems with high slippage when trying to swap DOT tokens on Osmosis, and they can't move them back to Axelar. The question is whether the Picasso issue is resolved, but from the messages, it looks like it hasn't been fixed yet.

Then there's the part about the team not having a plan for alloys before deprecating Picasso assets. That's a decision point they should have considered. Also, mentions of needing to contact support via Discord and the official support site. Scam proposals on Keplr are another concern, with someone falling victim. The users are asking about raising the minimum deposit to combat scams and the timing of the next token burning event (thirdening). Testnet faucet info and a Telegram link are provided for support.

I should structure the summary to highlight the ongoing problems with Picasso and the bridge, the lack of a team plan, the high slippage issue, scam proposals, support measures like the support site and Telegram, and the questions about minimum deposits and thirdening. Keep it concise, bullet points maybe, focusing on key issues and decisions mentioned.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Picasso Asset Issues**: Users report ongoing problems with Picasso assets, including high slippage preventing swaps (e.g., DOT tokens on Osmosis) and inability to revert assets to Axelar. The issue remains unresolved.  
2. **Solana Bridge Concerns**: Nostradamus411 notes frequent issues with the Picasso Solana bridge requiring Discord support intervention.  
3. **Team Planning Critique**: Nostradamus411 criticizes the team for lacking a plan before deprecating Picasso assets, complicating user transitions.  
4. **Scam Proposals**: Multiple users highlight scams on Keplr (e.g., fake Osmosis voting notifications) and malicious URLs. Cosmosrescue mentions 4 scams in a week and suggests raising minimum deposit requirements to mitigate such risks.  
5. **Support Resources**: Osmosis support directs users to their official site (support.osmosis.zone) and a Telegram faucet link (t.me/+sq8mti4SgfwzYzU1).  
6. **Thirdening Timing**: A

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided chat messages as a comma-separated list.

First, I'll read through each message to understand the context. The messages mention Picasso, Solana bridge issues, Axelar, Osmosis, DOT tokens, high slippage, thirdening, testnet faucet, scam URLs, Keplr notifications, and minimum deposit for proposals.

Looking at the first few messages, the main issue seems to be problems with Picasso's Solana bridge, causing users to face issues and seek help on Discord. Then there's a mention of moving DOT tokens to Osmosis and not being able to swap or move back due to high slippage. The user asks if the problem with Picasso assets is solved, so that's another topic.

Other messages include questions about the next thirdening, which I think refers to a token event. Testnet faucet is mentioned with a command and a Telegram link. Scam URLs and proposals are discussed, with users noting difficulty in keeping up with scams and raising the minimum deposit. Keplr browser notifications and their annoyance are also a point. There's a support site link and some mentions of team planning regarding alloys and asset deprecation.

I need to group these into distinct topics. Picasso's issues, Solana bridge problems, Axelar and Osmosis token movement, high slippage, thirdening event, testnet faucet, scam URLs and proposals, minimum deposit considerations, Keplr notifications, and support site. Also, the manual handling of scam proposals and the team's planning might be part of the topics.

Wait, some messages are about the same topic. For example, Picasso's deprecation and the team's plan. Maybe combine those. Also, Osmosis testnet tokens and the faucet are related. Scam URLs and scam proposals are similar but might need to be separate. The support site is a resource, not a topic. Thirdening is a specific event. High slippage is a problem when swapping. The Keplr notifications and the manual intervention point are separate but related to user experience.

So the main topics would be: Picasso asset issues, Solana bridge problems, Axelar token movement, Osmosis testnet tokens, high slippage, thirdening event, testnet faucet, scam URLs, scam proposals, minimum deposit increase, Keplr notifications, and team planning for alloys. Let me check if any of these can be merged

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a series of chat messages and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with the latest one from BasementNodes: "I think it's that Picasso doesn't work great yeah." The key phrase here is "doesn't work great," which sounds negative. They're probably talking about some issues with Picasso.

Next, Nostradamus411's two messages. The first one asks if something on Picasso's side triggered problems and mentions needing to go to Discord for issues with the Solana bridge. That's negative because they're having trouble and needing support. The second message talks about the team not having a plan for alloys before deprecating Picasso assets. Again, pointing out a lack of planning, which is a negative sentiment.

Then there's kychuli saying "it has not been corrected yet." That's neutral in tone but the context is about an unresolved issue, so maybe leaning negative. 

zzxzzzzzzjdk's message is about moving DOT tokens to Osmosis, converting them, but facing high slippage and can't move back to Axelar. They end with a question about if the problem is solved. This is definitely negative because they're stuck with issues.

hleb_albau's message is a question about whether the user is talking about Osmo's price or stake rewards. That seems neutral since it's just asking for clarification.

user_2138087871 asks about the next thirdening. Neutral, just a factual question.

jasbanza provides a command and a Telegram link. Neutral as well, just sharing information.

infams asks how to get testnet tokens after trying Discord without luck. The mention of "no luck" adds a slight negative, but the main request is neutral.

VexxVakan's "Unfortunately yes" is negative. The context before was about something bad happening, so this confirms the negative sentiment.

cosmosrescue's message about the same URL as a hidden scam and difficulty keeping up with scam URLs. Negative because they're discussing scams.

osmosis_statbot shares an official support link. Neutral, just providing help.

VexxVakan's question about when a proposal is considered harmful. The user is probably frustrated, so maybe negative.

cosmosrescue mentions browser notifications being annoying

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me start by reading through the provided chat messages carefully. The goal is to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps mentioned by the users. 

First, looking at the messages from BasementNodes and Nostradamus411, they mention issues with Picasso's Solana bridge requiring Discord support. Nostradamus411 also points out that the team should have had a plan before deprecating Picasso assets. This suggests a possible action item about planning for asset deprecation.

Then, zzxzzzzzzjdk asks if the problem with Picasso assets is solved. The response from kychuli says it hasn't been corrected yet. So the next step here might be to fix that issue.

User_2138087871 asks about the next thirdening, which seems like a scheduled event. That's a decision or next step related to timing.

Jasbanza mentions a testnet faucet command and shares a Telegram link. Infams asks how to get Osmosis testnet tokens after trying Discord without luck. This indicates a need to provide information or assistance regarding testnet tokens.

VexxVakan and cosmosrescue discuss Keplr notifications and scam URLs. Cosmosrescue mentions someone fell for a scam and asks if raising the minimum deposit is being considered. This implies possible action items like updating URL blacklists or adjusting deposit requirements.

Osmsosis_statbot provides a support link, which is a next step for users needing help.

Putting this all together, the main points are issues with Picasso assets needing resolution, planning for deprecation, handling scams (manual URL blocking, minimum deposit adjustment), testnet faucet assistance, and the next thirdening date. I need to list these clearly as action items, decisions, or next steps without including unrelated messages.
