## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify what's important.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's just a standard support notice, so maybe mention it briefly. Then there's kychuli saying they don't know the timeline and that Portal's messaging hasn't changed. That's about delays or uncertainty in updates. 

Next, chetcvale13 is asking about Wormhole Portal integration with Osmosis. So the key point here is the question about Wormhole's status. Then osmosis_news shares a Twitter link, but without the content, it's hard to say more. Maybe note that there's a shared link but details aren't provided here.

SasoLithops thanks someone, and kychuli mentions a fix being pushed to the main page soon, with a link to a pool. The correction and upcoming deployment are important here. Also, SasoLithops had an error with liquidity out of range, asking if it's a Ledger issue. The scammer warning is there too, but maybe that's just a side note.

Looking at the osmogovbot messages, there's a proposal to add quote denoms to the permissioned list. The user should know that there's a proposal in progress, and the assets involved. Another proposal about lending USDC on Mars Protocol, depositing 1M USDC to earn APY. That's a financial decision, so definitely key.

Then there's some casual messages about the autumn equinox and positive sentiments, which probably aren't important for a summary focused on key points and decisions. The BasementNodes message about surviving is vague, maybe part of a conversation not relevant here.

So, the main points are the support link, Wormhole Portal inquiry, the two proposals (adding quote assets and lending USDC), the fix for the pool page, and the scammer warning. Need to structure this concisely, grouping similar topics. Also, note the pending implementation of Proposal 819 related to removing quote asset requirements. Make sure to mention the specific assets and the interim addition. For the Mars Protocol, the deposit amount and APY are important. The pool correction and scammer warning should be included as recent developments. The other messages are either too

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's about directing users to the official support site. So the topic here is "official support site". Then there are a few messages from kychuli and chetcvale13 discussing Wormhole Portal's integration with Osmosis, mentioning timelines and the same messaging from Portal. That seems like a recurring topic, so "Wormhole Portal integration" and "timeline for feature addition" would be relevant.

Next, osmosis_news shares a Twitter link. Without the content of the tweet, maybe the topic is just "social media updates" or "Twitter announcement", but since other messages mention specific proposals, maybe it's related to governance. However, the exact text isn't here, so I might need to check if other entries have more context. The following messages from SasoLithops and kychuli talk about a liquidity error and a fix being pushed to the main page. The link provided is a Vercel app, so maybe "liquidity pool issue" and "frontend update deployment".

Then there's another osmogovbot message about adding quote denoms to the permissioned list, referencing a proposal. That's clearly about "adding quote assets to permissioned list" and "governance proposals". Another osmogovbot message mentions lending USDC on Mars Protocol, so topics here could be "lending USDC on Mars Protocol" and "community pool management".

The messages from Sandro20212 and JGnft_is_me are about token migration and a raffle. So "token migration" and "raffle announcement". The rest from eunoia_wellspring and AnonZuk mention the autumn equinox and some sentiments, which might be "seasonal events" and "community sentiment discussion". BasementNodes' message "Well, I survived" is vague, but maybe part of community sentiment or a specific event reference.

I need to ensure that each topic is distinct and captures the essence without overlapping. Also, check for any other mentions like APY, economic activity, or specific tokens like $LAB. But the user wants main topics, so maybe "APY on USDC deposits"

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- osmosis (10 mentions)
- https (8 mentions)
- pool (7 mentions)
- usdc (7 mentions)
- just (5 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start by reading through all the texts carefully.

The first message is from osmosis_statbot providing a support link. That's straightforward and helpful, so probably positive. The user is offering assistance, which is a good thing.

Next, kychuli says, "not sure on a timeline at all." The uncertainty here might lean negative because they're expressing a lack of clear information, which can be frustrating.

Another message from kychuli mentions Portal's repeated "we will add it soon" messaging. This sounds negative too, as it indicates impatience or dissatisfaction with delays.

chetcvale13 is asking about Wormhole Portal integration. It's a question without clear emotion, so neutral. They might be seeking information but not expressing a strong sentiment yet.

osmosis_news shares a link. Since there's no additional text, it's hard to gauge sentiment. Neutral unless the link content is known, but as per the text given, neutral.

SasoLithops says "Awesome thank youüèÜ" which is clearly positive. The emoji and exclamation mark reinforce that.

kychuli again mentions pushing something to the main page and Vercel links looking weird. The first part might be neutral or positive, but the second part about the links looking weird could be slightly negative. However, the main point here is that a correction was made and it's being pushed, so maybe positive? Wait, the message says "should be pushed" and "those vercel links look weird." The correction being pushed is positive, but the comment on the links is negative. Hmm, but the overall message is about a fix being implemented, so maybe neutral with a mix of both. But the user is informing others, so the sentiment might be neutral.

Another kychuli message: "this has been corrected, will be pushed to main shortly." Definitely positive because it's resolving an issue. The part about editing the pool number shows a solution, so positive.

SasoLithops reports an error with liquidity out of range and asks if it's a ledger issue. Then there's a part about scammers which is negative. The error mention is negative, the scammer part is also negative. So overall negative.

osmogovbot's message is about a proposal, factual and informative. Neutral

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's anything that requires someone to do something, a decision made, or a next step mentioned.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot: it's a link to the support site. Maybe not an action item unless someone needs to visit it, but since it's just providing help, maybe no action here.

Then kychuli at 21:17:23 says "not sure on a timeline at all" and another message "nothing new, just the same 'we will add it soon' messaging from Portal." So that's about Portal not having updates, but no specific action item here. Maybe the fact that Portal is supposed to add something soon, but no timeline given.

Next, chetcvale13 asks, "Any word on Wormhole Portal working with Osmosis." That's a question, but the previous messages indicate there's no timeline. So maybe no action item here unless someone needs to respond.

osmosis_news shares a link. Not an action item unless the link contains news that requires action, but the user hasn't provided the content of the link, so I can't assume that.

SasoLithops says "Awesome thank youüèÜ" which is a reaction, not an action.

Then kychuli messages: "should be pushed to the main page soon ik those vercel links look weird" and "this has been corrected, will be pushed to main shortly. you can edit the pool number here [link]." So here, there's an action item: pushing a correction to the main page, and a next step of editing the pool number via the provided link. Also, the mention of Vercel links looking weird might be a note, but not an action item unless someone needs to address that.

SasoLithops again mentions an error with liquidity out of range and asks if it's a ledger issue. The part about scammers is just a warning, so maybe someone needs to check if the liquidity error is specific to Ledger, but it's phrased as a question. So perhaps the next step is to investigate whether that's a Ledger-only issue.

osmogovbot has a message from JohnnyWyles about a proposal to add quote denoms to the permissioned list. The proposal
