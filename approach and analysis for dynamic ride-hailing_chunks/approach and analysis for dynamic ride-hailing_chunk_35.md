**Original Text:**

The reason for that is that the strategy allows delayed responses, and
matching-based approaches are expected to always provide superior
results when the response may be delayed. The strategy can, however,
be useful in very large practical applications where it is not possible
to calculate the full distance matrix for the matching approaches in a
reasonable amount of time (Maciejewski et al., 2016). If we do not require an immediate response, matching-based approaches are typically used in the literature. They gather incoming
requests and available vehicles over a short timeframe ùõøùëÄ to then
solve a matching problem, which assigns the open requests to the
available vehicles. Because multiple assignments are made together (in
contrast to the nearest strategy), the resulting solution is usually of
higher quality. In most cases, the problem is formulated as a linear
cost-minimum matching problem on a bipartite graph.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the provided text chunk:

**Technical details and parameters:**

1. The technique being discussed is dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.
2. The approach involves delayed responses, which can be useful in large practical applications where calculating the full distance matrix for matching-based approaches would take too long.

**Connection to or building upon surrounding context:**

This chunk builds upon the discussion of simulation and modeling techniques (e.g., Bischoff & Maciejewski's work on autonomous taxi deployment) by introducing the concept of dynamic dispatch and real-time management. It also expands on the idea of matching-based approaches, which are expected to provide superior results when responses are delayed.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

1. The delay in response time.
2. In practical applications where large-scale computations (e.g., calculating full distance matrices) would be inefficient.
3. The need for high-quality solutions, particularly when multiple assignments are made together.
4. The formulation of the problem as a linear cost-minimum matching problem on a bipartite graph.

Overall, this chunk provides context and technical details on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, building upon existing knowledge and expanding on new ideas.
