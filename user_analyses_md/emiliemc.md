Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the tweets from a specific account and provide a summary with several sections. They also want five keywords/tags for post-processing. 

First, I need to look at the provided tweets. The first one is a retweet from @APompliano about Coinbase joining the S&P 500. The second is a retweet from @scottshapiro about leaving Google for Coinbase and the common question about crypto dying. 

Main topics: The user is discussing Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 and their career move from Google to Coinbase. The themes are career transition, crypto, and financial markets.
