**Original Text:**

8â€“10 (the average delay, waiting
time and walking time for the requests departing/arriving in each node), and also with respect to the percentage of rejected requests. All correlations are negative, meaning that requests that begin or finish close to the center face a worse quality of service, which is
particularly true for requests whose origin is there. The fact that rejections present the lowest correlations can be explained because
most of the nodes present no rejections at all. 4. Conclusions
Departing from existing methods to assign vehicles to sets of requests in large instances of a SMoD, we have included the chance of
walking the first or last legs in order to avoid extra detours that might increase traveling times and the chances of being rejected. We
theoretically discussed why walking could improve ridesharing systems, and we showed that doing so might reduce the flexibility of
the system to reassign.
