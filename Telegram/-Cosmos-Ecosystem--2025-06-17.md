## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I need to go through each message and extract the important information.

Starting with Asa332's message on June 17 at 14:20 UTC. They mention that Namada ($NAM) will be listed on Kucoin on June 19th at 10:00 UTC. Also, it'll be on major DEXs like Osmosis once IBC transfers are enabled this Friday, referencing a governance proposal. That's a key point about the token listings and dates.

Then Criptoruim responds at 13:59 UTC, saying they asked in the Telegram chat and will add it to Cosmic Agenda if there's a live stream link. They need the stream link for notifications. The next message from unknown at 13:58 says there's no info on streaming yet but they'll record all sessions. So the decision here is that even if there's no live stream, recordings will be available.

Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot at 13:55 UTC talks about the InterChain Summit agenda having public sessions and networking events, but no livestream details. They suggest checking the official Berlin event page or Cosmos Twitter. Also, a technical mention of H3 geospatial engine for node participation. But maybe the key here is the lack of livestream details and the recommended resources.

Criptoruim again at 13:55 UTC asks if it's livestreamed. Then unknown at 12:53 UTC mentions the agenda is for two days, updated on June 17. Another message from unknown at 12:53 UTC same as above. 

Earlier, unknown at 12:42 UTC provides details about the event in Berlin on June 20-21, free registration, new speakers Chris from soonami.io and Paul from KYVE, part of Berlin Blockchain Week. They mention 31 speakers over two days. Links to Twitter, Telegram, and the summit site.

Asa332's messages at 11:06 and 07:58 UTC are just links to Twitter posts, which might not be needed in the summary unless the content of those links is described, but since the user provided the text, maybe they are just references.

Putting this together

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key points.

Starting with Asa332's message at 14:20:10. They mention that NAM will be listed on Kucoin on June 19th, 2025, and also on major DEXs like Osmosis once IBC transfers are enabled. The links are probably important, but the user just wants topics, so maybe the main points here are the Kucoin listing, DEX listings, and IBC transfers activation.

Next, Criptoruim's message at 13:59:59 talks about adding to Cosmic Agenda and asking for a live stream link. So the topics here might be Cosmic Agenda inclusion and inquiry about live stream.

Then, an unknown user at 13:58:48 says they don't know about online streaming but will record sessions. That adds uncertainty about live streaming and mentions session recordings.

Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot's message at 13:55:32 refers to the InterChain Summit agenda with public sessions and networking events, but no livestream details. They suggest checking official pages and mention H3 geospatial engine for node participation. So topics here are the summit agenda, public sessions, networking events, H3 geospatial engine application.

Criptoruim again at 13:55:08 asks if it's livestreamed, so that's another mention of livestream inquiry.

The unknown user at 12:53:11 and 12:53:01 both mention the 2-day agenda updated on June 17th. Then the message at 12:42:36 gives details about the summit in Berlin on June 20-21, free registration, new speakers like Chris from soonami.io and Paul from KYVE, being part of Berlin Blockchain Week. So topics here include the summit location (Berlin), dates (June 20-21), free registration, new speakers, Berlin Blockchain Week.

Asa332's later messages at 11:06:20 and 07:58:20 are just links, but the user might not need the links themselves

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a series of chat messages and wants to know the overall sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral. First, I need to read through each message carefully and understand the context.

Starting with the first message from Asa332: "Wait is over, Namada [$NAM will be listed on Kucoin]... trading will starts at 10.00 UTC, 19th June 2025." Then there's another part about $NAM on DEXs like Osmosis after IBC transfers are enabled. The mention of a government proposal link. The words "Wait is over" and the listing on a major exchange usually indicate positive news. People often get excited about new listings because it can mean increased visibility and potential value for the token. The use of "will be listed" and "we will see" suggests anticipation and optimism. So this part is positive.

Next, Criptoruim at 13:59:59 says, "ok cool. Just asked in the TG chat. will put it on Cosmic Agenda either way if there is a live stream link please let me know..." The phrase "ok cool" is a positive reaction. They're offering to add the live stream link to the agenda, showing helpfulness and eagerness. Positive again.

Then unknown at 13:58:48 mentions not knowing about online streaming but will record sessions. Neutral here because it's just stating a fact without clear positive or negative emotion. They might be a bit uncertain but not unhappy.

Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot at 13:55:32 provides information about the summit agenda and suggests checking official sources. It also mentions a technical solution for mapping node participation. The tone is informative and helpful, so positive. The bot is assisting users, which is a positive contribution.

Criptoruim at 13:55:08 asks if it's going to be livestreamed. This is a neutral question seeking information. No sentiment here yet.

Unknown at 12:53:11 and 12:53:01 repeats "Agenda for 2 days" with the last update date. Neutral, just stating facts.

Unknown at 12:42:36 talks about the InterChain Summit in Berlin, mentions free registration, new speakers

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, and next steps from this text. First, I'll read through each message carefully to understand the context.

Starting with Asa332's message at 2025-06-17T14:20:10+00:00. They mention that $NAM will be listed on Kucoin on June 19th at 10:00 UTC. Also, they say it will be on major DEXs like Osmosis once IBC transfers are enabled on Friday, based on a governance proposal. So here, the action items might be the listing on Kucoin and DEXs. The decision is the listing dates and platforms, and next steps could be enabling IBC transfers.

Then Criptoruim at 2025-06-17T13:59:59+00:00 says they asked in the TG chat and will put it on Cosmic Agenda regardless. They also request a live stream link if available. So next steps here include adding to Cosmic Agenda and checking for a live stream link.

Unknown at 2025-06-17T13:58:48+00:00 mentions not knowing about online streaming but will record all sessions. So decision here is that sessions will be recorded, but no confirmation on live streaming yet.

Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot at 2025-06-17T13:55:32+00:00 talks about the InterChain Summit agenda having public sessions and networking events, but no livestream details. They suggest checking the official Berlin event page or Cosmos Ecosystem's Twitter. Also, if someone is technical, they can use their H3 geospatial engine for node participation mapping. So next steps here are checking the official sources for livestream info and possibly using the H3 engine for decentralized streaming.

Criptoruim at 2025-06-17T13:55:08+00:00 asks if it's going to be livestreamed. That's a question, so maybe not an action item but a point to address.
