## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 27

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

scenarios apart from the base case mentioned above maintained the SAV availability (SAV
vehicles proportional to SAV trips) with each SAV serving about 70 person-trips per SAV per
day. Figure 2 shows the average mode shares observed across all scenarios for Bloomington
when DRS was used. The impact of walking to a PUDO zone is likely to affect travelers’
willingness to choose SAVs, and was iteratively fed back into the mode choice, so the results
presented are for a converged run of travelers’ choice preferences. Compared to the base case
without DRS, percent eVMT dropped significantly, by about 12%, thanks to bundling rides
together, and the greater availability of SAVs to serve requests. Overall response times dropped
marginally when using DRS, likely owing to traveler pickups along existing trips. The response
times fall more with increasing trip density.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**
The text chunk describes a scenario involving scenarios (SAVs - Self-Driving Vehicles) and their interactions with pedestrian zones (PUDO - Public Parking Zone). Specifically:

* SAVs are proportional to SAV trips, maintaining the availability of vehicles as per the base case.
* The use of Disruption Reduction System (DRS) affects mode shares across all scenarios, including the comparison between the base case and the converged run.

**Context Connection:**
This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Establishing that this text is a reference list discussing shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), which is mentioned in the broader document title.
* Providing an overview of the scope and range of topics covered, including potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**
The requirements mentioned include:

* Need for specific information extracted from references
* Ability to analyze trends across papers

However, it's essential to note that these conditions are implicit in the text rather than being explicitly stated. The analysis is based on the understanding of the surrounding context and the provided technical details.

**Focused Analysis:**
This chunk explains how the use of DRS (Disruption Reduction System) affects mode shares and response times for SAVs (Self-Driving Vehicles) when compared to a base case without DRS, primarily in scenarios involving pedestrian zones. The analysis demonstrates the impact of bundling rides together and increasing vehicle availability on response times, highlighting the potential benefits of DRS in optimizing shared autonomous vehicles' performance in urban environments.
