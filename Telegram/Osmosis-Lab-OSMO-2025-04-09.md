## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key points and decisions. The user wants a concise summary focusing on those.

Starting from the bottom, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's a standard support notice, so maybe just mention it as a reference.

Then Criptoruim mentions starting a Twitter Space with Bitmosis and Babylonlabs. Mikebarb and Rekt_Zerker respond positively. That's an event announcement, so note that as an upcoming event.

Citizenweb3 is asking about docs for endpoints and sharing theirs. Mikebarb says to visit the official support site. So the key point here is the request for documentation and the response pointing to the support site.

Looking up, there's a discussion about listing $baby tokens on Osmosis. User_7123017101 asks when they can buy, and mikebarb mentions it'll be listed after Babylon initiates IBC, with a Twitter update. Then user_7123017101 says they'll buy a lot, and Mrtiahou tells them not to FOMO. So key points here: $baby token listing timing tied to Babylon's IBC, announcement via Twitter, and a user's intention to buy large.

Then halifa_xyz tries to initiate a private chat with mikebarb about an opportunity. Mikebarb asks what type, and halifa_xyz offers a DM. Mikebarb suggests the forum instead. So here, the key is the potential collaboration/private discussion being redirected to the forum.

Mrtiahou asks about native perps on Osmosis (non-Levana), and davidjgoosey says there are no concrete plans. So that's a decision point: no current plans for native perpetuals.

I need to structure this concisely. Maybe group related messages. Start with the main decisions: no native perps atm, redirecting collaboration to forum, $baby token listing after Babylon IBC. Then mention the Twitter Space event, and the support doc reference. Also note the user's FOMO warning.

Check if any details are missing. The user_7123017101 is asking about buying $baby, and the response links to Babylon's IBC. Then they express intent to buy, and Mrtiahou tells

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify what each one is discussing.

Starting with the first message from davidjgoosey: "No concrete plans for native perps atm". So, "native perps" (perpetual contracts) on Osmosis is a topic here. Then Mrtiahou asks about launching a native perps market on Osmosis, not involving Levana. That reinforces the topic of native perps on Osmosis. 

Next, mikebarb mentions reaching out to davidjgoosey but not being interested in OTC stuff. OTC (over-the-counter trading) is another topic. Then halifa_xyz wants to send a DM for a discussion, which relates to private discussions or DMs. 

halifa_xyz also talks about a valuable opportunity, so that's a potential topic. Mrtiahou tells someone not to FOMO (fear of missing out), which is a common term in crypto communities. 

user_7123017101 mentions buying $baby tokens and stability of the project. So topics here are $baby token and project stability. They also ask about listing $baby on Osmosis, so that's another point. 

mikebarb mentions Babylon initiating IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) and Twitter updates. IBC protocol and Babylon chain are technical topics. The user also asks about the genesis event, which is another term in blockchain for the initial launch phase. 

Criptoruim talks about philosophical bots, which might be a niche interest. Then there's a mention of aggregating Cosmos ecosystem spaces under one roof for searchability, so Cosmos ecosystem and space aggregation. 

Rekt_Zerker thanks for amplifying spaces, which relates to promoting or supporting community spaces. 

mikebarb shares a link to cosmos.directory/osmosis, which is about Osmosis-related resources. 

citizenweb3 is looking for docs on public endpoints, snapshots, etc., so Osmosis documentation and technical resources. 

Another message from mikebarb about troubleshooting by opening a ticket, which points to support or technical issues. 

Criptoruim mentions a Twitter Space hosted by madscientists_x about Bitmosis with babylonlabs_io, so Twitter Spaces and

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The conversation seems to be around Osmosis, a blockchain or DeFi platform, discussing things like native perpetuals, token listings, and technical support.

Starting with the first message: "No concrete plans for native perps atm" ‚Äì that's from Davidjgoosey. The user is asking about plans, and the response is that there's nothing concrete. This seems neutral because it's just stating a fact without expressing strong positive or negative emotions.

Next, Mrtiahou asks about launching a native perps market. The question itself is neutral, just inquiring about plans. Then Mikebarb says if it's OTC stuff, they aren't interested. "We aren't interested" sounds negative, especially since they mention OTC, which might be a sensitive topic. So that's negative.

Halifa_xyz asks to send a DM, and Mikebarb directs them to the forum. The exchange here is about moving the conversation to a specific platform, so both are neutral. Halifa_xyz suggests discussing privately, and Mikebarb gives a suggestion. Neutral again.

Mrtiahou says "Don‚Äôt Fomo please" ‚Äì Fomo is Fear of Missing Out. Telling someone not to Fomo could be a neutral statement, maybe calming them down. But sometimes "don't" can have a negative connotation, but in context, it's more about not panicking, so neutral.

User_7123017101 is excited about buying $baby tokens, thinks the project is stable. Definitely positive. Mikebarb mentions listing tokens after Babylon's IBC, "exciting launch" ‚Äì positive. Then user asks about when they can buy $baby, which is a neutral question. The user introduces themselves as a newbie, which is neutral.

Criptoruim says "i <3 philosophical bots" ‚Äì love heart, so positive. Then talks about the goal to amplify Cosmos spaces, which is positive. Rekt_Zerker thanks them, so positive. Mikebarb shares a link, calling it a solid list ‚Äì positive. Citizenweb3 asks about docs, which is neutral. Mikebarb offers help with an issue ‚Äì neutral. Criptoruim promotes a space with a rocket emoji ‚Äì positive. Osmosis_statbot gives a support

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message one by one and see if there's anything that requires action or is a decision.

Starting with the latest message from davidjgoosey: "No concrete plans for native perps atm." That's a decision or a current status. So the action item here is that there are no current plans for native perpetual markets on Osmosis, other than Levana. Maybe note that as a decision or a status update.

Then Mrtiahou asked if there's a plan for launching native perps. The response from davidjgoosey already answers that, so maybe that's just confirming the status. 

Looking at mikebarb's message: He tells someone to reach out to davidjgoosey but mentions they aren't interested in OTC stuff. So the action item here is that Osmosis isn't interested in OTC opportunities. That's a decision.

Next, halifa_xyz wants to send a DM. The conversation here seems to be about discussing something privately. The next step might be halifa_xyz sending a DM, but since it's not confirmed, maybe just note that he asked to send a DM and the response was to use the forum. 

mikebarb suggests using forum.osmosis.zone. So the next step for halifa_xyz is to use the forum instead of DM. Also, when halifa_xyz asked to discuss privately, mikebarb's reply was to ask what type of opportunity, so maybe that's a pending action for halifa_xyz to provide more details.

Other messages about $baby tokens: user_7123017101 asks when they can buy on Osmosis. mikebarb says it should be listed after Babylon initiates IBC, so the next step is waiting for Babylon to start IBC, and then listing. Also, he mentions posting Twitter updates, so that's an action item to announce on Twitter.

Another user asks where to find docs for public endpoints, etc. mikebarb says to open a ticket if there's an issue. So the next step there is for the user to open a ticket if they need help, and the team will troubleshoot.

There's a mention of a space hosted by Criptoruim and madscientists_x. Maybe that's
