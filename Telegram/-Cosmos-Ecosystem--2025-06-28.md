## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this chat text concisely, focusing on the key points and decisions. Let me start by going through each message and identifying the important elements.

First, there's a message from Nicolas_Boulay mentioning that Luncverse and its Layer 2 currency #Cookie are live on Cosmostation. That's a key point about project launches. Then, user_7164487109 says "It come in pack" and later "Let me make you the pack." Maybe there's a pack being created or distributed, but not sure. 

Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot asks about #Cookie's tokenomics aligning with community-driven principles versus VC-backed models. This is a critical question about governance and fairness. Nicolas_Boulay responds about needing the right team and resilience, stating Luncverse will be game-changing. 

There's a mention of a video meeting for Cosmos Voice #10 with Reece Williams discussing WAVS and AVS infrastructure. The event starts at 15:00 UTC, hosted by Greg from DAODISEO. The meeting seems important for project updates. 

Dr0By and others express enthusiasm and trust in the project, but also ask about trusting operators who aren't validators. That's a concern about security and decentralization. 

Lunaticlunalover69 talks about incremental rollouts of features like lending pools on testnet, planning governance and staking contracts before mainnet. They mention budget constraints but still outperforming other chains. 

Unknown users share links to NFT-avatars, roadmaps, and a USTC staking system proposal. The NFT distribution model includes projects like Expedition and Centrifuge. 

Reecepbcups and others thank participants for the meeting, indicating it was successful and they'll meet again next week. 

Deadman985's "Good night" and "Good morning" messages are just greetings, so maybe not key points. 

So, the main elements are: Luncverse and #Cookie's launch on Cosmostation, the Cosmos Voice #10 meeting details and discussions on WAVS and AVS, tokenomics and governance concerns, incremental feature rollouts, NFT-avatars and their distribution, and the USTC staking proposal. 

I should structure the summary around these points, highlighting the project launches, community discussions on decentralization, event announcements, development

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by reading through the entire text to understand the context and identify recurring themes or keywords.

First, looking at the messages, there's a lot of discussion around "Luncverse" and its developments, especially with mentions of "#Cookie" as a token. Nicolas_Boulay talks about Luncverse being game-changing for Cosmos and mentions the tokenomics of #Cookie. Then there's a question from Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot about whether #Cookie's tokenomics align with community-driven principles like Ethereum R1's fair launch model, comparing it to VC-backed projects criticized on platforms like Dexscreener. So tokenomics and governance models are definitely a topic.

Another recurring element is "Cosmos Voice #10" with details about the event happening on June 28, discussing Layer Labs, WAVS, and the future of AVS infrastructure. There are multiple reminders and mentions of this event, so that's a key topic. The host Greg and guest Reece Williams from Layer Labs are mentioned, so maybe AVS infrastructure and related discussions are part of that.

There's also mention of NFTs, specifically "NFT-avatars" and "NFT-spheres" from posthuman.digital, including a roadmap for NFT-avatars becoming Digital Twins with AI. The distribution model for NFT-spheres and eligible projects like Expedition, Centrifuge, etc., are highlighted. So NFTs in the Cosmos ecosystem are another topic.

The user lunaticlunalover69 talks about USTC staking system for Terra Classic, referencing a proposal similar to LUNC staking. This relates to Terra Classic and Cosmos ecosystem integration, so staking mechanisms and Terra Classic developments are a topic.

Technical discussions around blockchain infrastructure, composability between lending pools, and avoiding technical debt are mentioned by Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot. Also, Dr0By questions trust in operators who aren't validators, indicating concerns about decentralization and security.

Other mentions include the Cosmos Ecosystem Telegram chat, the team's resilience and consistency, and the Layer 2 currency #Cookie. There's also a reference to a video meeting discussing the future of AVS infra, which ties back to Cosmos Voice #10.

Additionally, there's a birthday mention for #NFT #News #135, which might not

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any tasks or plans mentioned.

Starting with the latest messages. The user_7164487109 says, "Let me make you the pack." That sounds like an action item where they're offering to create a pack, maybe related to something discussed earlier. I should note that as an action item.

Then, Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot asks a question about tokenomics alignment with community-driven principles. This might not be an action item but a query seeking information. However, the response from Nicolas_Boulay mentions that #Cookie is live on Cosmostation. That's a decision or next step indicating deployment.

Looking at Nicolas_Boulay's other messages: "Luncverse is live in the cosmostation!" and similar ones. These confirm that the project has been launched on a platform, which is a concrete step taken.

The unknown user mentions a video record being uploaded ASAP. That's a next step after the meeting. Also, spreading the word about Wavs and seeing each other next week. These are action items for promotion and future meetings.

Reecepbcups thanks everyone for having him on, which might be part of a meeting or event. The event details were mentioned earlier, so maybe the next steps include following up on that event.

The message from lunaticlunalover69 talks about testnet rollout for lending pools and incremental features. That's a clear action plan for development phases. Also, launching governance and staking contracts before mainnet, which is a decision and next step.

The USTC staking system proposal by Doncho_MIOFF is a decision to explore implementing staking, so that's an action item for the project.

The roadmap link for NFT-avatars and the distribution model for NFT-spheres are both action items related to those projects. The user_1127570498 and others mention the Cosmos Voice #10 event, which is a scheduled meeting, so attending or preparing for that is a next step.

I need to make sure I don't miss any other steps. The "Check this out" and "Thank you" messages might not be action items unless they refer to specific tasks. Also, the "Wen
