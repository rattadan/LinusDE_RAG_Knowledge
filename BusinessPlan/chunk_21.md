App Store when “ride-hailing” is searched with relevant filters. 223 applications appear when
“ride-hailing” is searched in the Play Store, and 202 appear when “rideshare” is searched. With this search
information, we approximate 200+ relevant ride-hailing applications to exist, however, we view this
number as closer to 500+ when accounting for applications that haven’t acquired a critical user base
(addressable customers). We consider applications that haven’t acquired a critical user base as part of our
addressable market because we can partner with them to help them grow their driver user base. Global Market Share

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you're discussing the development and management of ride-hailing applications, specifically highlighting some statistics from mobile app stores.

The text provides some interesting insights into how search terms can influence app store visibility. Here are the key points:

1. When searching for "ride-hailing" on the App Store, 184 apps appear in the results. This suggests that a significant number of ride-hailing applications are available in the app store.
2. In contrast, when searching for "rideshare", 223 apps appear. This implies that there may be more ride-hailing applications than traditional ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft.
3. When searching for "ride-hailing" on the Play Store, approximately 202 apps appear. This suggests that there are even more ride-hailing applications available in the Google Play Store.

These statistics suggest that there is a significant number of ride-hailing applications out there, but not all of them may be actively using these apps or have acquired a critical user base. The developer community mentioned at the end indicates that many developers create and distribute ride-hailing applications across various platforms, including iOS and Android.

Overall, it appears that the concept of an "addressable market" is relevant here, as you're looking to partner with underperforming apps to help them grow their user base.
