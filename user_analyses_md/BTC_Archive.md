Putting tweets in the context of the author's intentions:
The BTC_Archive account appears to be intentionally curating and highlighting news that demonstrates Bitcoin's growing legitimacy, adoption, and value appreciation. By sharing stories about institutional investors buying Bitcoin, celebrities endorsing it, and governments implementing Bitcoin-related infrastructure, the account is building a narrative that Bitcoin is inevitable as a financial revolution. The focus on Wall Street adoption, celebrity endorsements, and government initiatives suggests the author is trying to position Bitcoin as both a grassroots movement and an institutional asset class simultaneously.

The account's emphasis on dramatic price movements, missed opportunities (like the German government selling Bitcoin), and future price predictions (from Standard Chartered) indicates the author is trying to create a sense of urgency and FOMO (fear of missing out) among potential investors.
