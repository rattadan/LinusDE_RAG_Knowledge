## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. The text is a series of chat messages.

First, there's a message from wlkatja about a community call this Friday on Discord with Kesha and Jon. They mention a Special Edition with Alpha and a glimpse of the Warden App. The call is for Q&A and discussing AI, Blockchain, and Warden spaces. The details are the Discord link and time (every Friday, 10 AM UTC). Also, a request to share the event.

Then Asa332 shares a link from CosmosEcosystem on April 16th. Not sure what the link is about, but maybe just note the mention.

drKate_phmn has a few messages: one about an interview with JP Mullin, another linking to Cito_Zone's tweet, and another linking to JunoNetwork's tweet. These might be related to collaborations or discussions in the community, but without the content of the tweets, I can't elaborate much.

Asa332 again mentions Union becoming an early canonical interop provider for Babylon ecosystem. Their BTC app is live, connecting Babylon, corn, BOB, and Ethereum. There's a speculation about a possible future Union Airdrop. Links provided.

Criptoruim says they can add something to the agenda if someone lets them know. Maybe indicating they're organizing a meeting or event.

So the key points are the Community Call details, Union's new role with their BTC app, and the mentions of interviews and other social media links. The decisions might be around attending the call, checking Union's app, and possibly considering the airdrop speculation. Need to present this concisely without extra details.

**Summary:**  
- **Community Call:** This Friday (18.04) at 10 AM UTC on Discord with Kesha and special guest Jon, featuring updates on the Warden App, Alpha developments, and Q&A on AI, blockchain, and Warden Protocol.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user wants a comma-separated list, so I need to identify the key subjects discussed in the messages provided.

First, looking at the first message from wlkatja: It mentions a Community Call on Discord, a Special Edition with Jon, Alpha and Warden App, and discussions about AI, Blockchain, and Warden spaces. So possible topics here are Community Call, Discord Server, Special Edition, Jon, Alpha, Warden App, AI, Blockchain, Warden.

Then there's a link to share on X (Twitter), which might relate to Social Media or Promotion, but maybe that's not a main topic. The other messages are from different users. Asa332 shares a link about Union becoming a canonical interop provider for Babylon ecosystem, connecting BTC app with several networks. So topics here could be Union, Babylon Ecosystem, Interop Providers, BTC App, Ethereum Networks, and maybe Airdrop speculation.

Next, drKate_phmn has an interview with JP Mullin, so that's an Interview. Then there are links from drKate_phmn and Asa332, but they might not be topics themselves unless the links refer to specific projects. The last message from Criptoruim talks about adding something to the agenda, but it's unclear what, so maybe not a main topic.

Putting it all together, the main topics seem to be Community Call, Discord Server, Special Edition, Jon, Alpha, Warden App, AI, Blockchain, Warden, Union, Babylon Ecosystem, BTC App, Ethereum Networks, Airdrop speculation, Interview with JP Mullin. Wait, but some of these might be too specific or part of the same context. For example, Warden App and Warden Protocol are related. Also, the initial message mentions discussing what's ongoing in AI, Blockchain, and Warden spaces, so those three are probably main topics. The Special Edition with Jon is a key event, so that's a topic. The Union and Babylon connection involves Union, Babylon Ecosystem, BTC App, and maybe Ethereum. The Airdrop speculation is part of that message. The interview with JP Mullin is another topic. The dates and links might not be necessary unless they're part of the topic, but the user probably wants the subjects discussed, not the metadata.

So final list should include: Community Call, Discord Server

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a series of chat messages from different people. I need to determine the overall sentiment of the entire text, but maybe also check each part since they're from different users.

Starting with the first message by wlkatja. It's an announcement about a Community Call on Discord. Words like "Join us," "Special Edition," "Alpha," "glimpse," and "answer all your questions" seem positive. Emojis like üëæ and üëÄ add a playful or excited tone. The links and details about where and when are neutral, but the overall intent is to engage the community, so probably positive.

Next, Asa332 shares a link. No text, just a URL. That's neutral because there's no sentiment expressed here. Maybe they're sharing a post or article, but without context, it's hard to say. Neutral.

Then drKate_phmn has an interview mention with JP Mullin. The text is just "Interview with JP Mullin" and some other links. Again, factual, no clear positive or negative words. Neutral.

Another drKate_phmn message with a link. Same as above, just sharing content. Neutral.

Another link from drKate_phmn. Still neutral.

Asa332 again talks about Union becoming an interop provider for Babylon ecosystem. Mentions "BTC app is now live" and connects several networks. Words like "now live" and "connecting" might indicate progress, which is positive. There's a speculation about a potential airdrop, which could be exciting for some, but the user adds "(speculation)" so they're cautious. The sentiment here is a mix, but since it's announcing a new development, probably positive.

Criptoruim says, "please let me know, see if I can add it to the agenda in some way." This sounds like a request for input, maybe trying to be helpful. The tone isn't negative, but it's also not overly positive. It's more neutral or slightly positive if they're showing interest in collaboration.

Putting it all together: The main message from wlkatja is positive. The other messages are mostly neutral except for Asa332's second message which is positive. The overall sentiment seems positive because the primary content is promoting an event and sharing project updates, which are generally seen as positive in community contexts. The other links and mentions don't

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, and next steps from this text. First, I need to read through the provided messages carefully. 

The first message is from wlkatja. It's about a Community Call happening this Friday. They mention joining on Discord on the 18th of April with Kesha, and Jon will be there for a Special Edition with Alpha and a glimpse of the Warden App. The call is at 10 AM UTC every Friday. There's a link to the Discord server and a prompt to share and love the event. So, the main action items here might be joining the call, preparing questions, and possibly sharing the event on social media.

Then there are several messages from Asa332 and drKate_phmn. Asa332's message about Union becoming a canonical interop provider for Babylon ecosystem mentions connecting several networks and a speculation about a possible airdrop. The link provided could be for further information. However, this seems more like an update rather than an action item. 

drKate_phmn has a message about an interview with JP Mullin and another about adding something to the agenda. The last message from Criptoruim says, "please let me know, see if I can add it to the agenda in some way." That sounds like a request or a next step to follow up on adding something to the agenda.

So, putting this together, the key points are:

1. The Community Call on Friday, 18th April at 10 AM UTC on Discord. Action item: Join the call, prepare questions, and share the event.
2. Jon's Special Edition part might involve looking into Alpha and the Warden App, so maybe preparing for that if relevant.
3. Criptoruim's message suggests that someone needs to follow up or provide information to add an item to the agenda.

I should check if there are any other mentions of decisions or next steps. The other messages from drKate_phmn and Asa332 are links or retweets, which might not be action items unless specified. The main next steps are related to the community call and the agenda addition request.
