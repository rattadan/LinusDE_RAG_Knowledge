   - Matches presidential communication pattern on development issues

Positioning as both continental climate leader (via AGII advocacy) and hands-on domestic reformer (addressing Nairobi's electrical safety crises) creates strategic legitimacy across scales. The allocation announcement demonstrates prioritization of marginalized communities while maintaining bureaucratic formality.
