# User Analysis: CetusProtocol

## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants an analysis of the provided tweets from a Twitter account. They need a summary with five keywords/tags for postprocessing. 

First, I need to look at the tweets. Both are from the same account, Curious, and they talk about Sui native swaps on Binance Wallet. The main topics are the launch of the swaps, the ecosystem, and the connection with Binance. The language is enthusiastic, using emojis and hashtags like #Sui, #Cetus, and #Binance. The tone is positive and excited, celebrating the new feature.

Key characteristics of communication: the author is likely a promoter or representative of the Sui ecosystem. They use emojis to make the message engaging. The communication is structured with key points, maybe using bullet points or clear sections. The account is promoting the Sui ecosystem, so the ecosystem here is the Sui project itself.

Psychological evaluation: The person might be a motivator for the Sui community, driven by a desire to connect and grow the ecosystem. They value community and innovation. Their emotions are positive, excited, and enthusiastic. They might make decisions based on community growth and innovation.

For the keywords, the main ones would be Sui ecosystem, Binance Wallet, native swaps, community growth, and innovation. These capture the main topics, the ecosystem, the specific features, the goals, and the values.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and focused on the most distinctive patterns. The keywords should be relevant and help in postprocessing. Also, the user wants the response to be in a specific format, so I need to structure it properly.
