## Original Text
```
to the costs of litigation, Offchain Labs will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue to apply.

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, Offchain Labs agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Offchain Labs written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
