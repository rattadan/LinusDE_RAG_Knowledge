## Chunk 24

**Original Text:**

(Often times, for ordinary users, taking an existing token to a chain it doesn’t exist leaves them stuck on that new chain with a useless token). That’s why we need to “warm start” channels — to enable recommending them as bridging routes. ​
3. Wait up to 24 hours and verify
Skip’s intelligent route detection should automatically detect new routes for all assets and chains that meet the above requirements in 4-8 hours. This will not happen immediately.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you're discussing a process for warming start channels on a blockchain network, specifically Ethereum, where existing tokens are being bridged to new chains without proper guidance. The key points you've highlighted include:

1. The current process can leave users stuck with useless or non-existent token bridges.
2. Warming start channels are needed to enable recommending them as suitable bridge routes for new assets and chains.
3. A delay of up to 24 hours is required before intelligent route detection occurs, which will automatically identify new routes for bridging that meet certain criteria within a shorter timeframe.

It appears you're working on a project or proposal related to improving the process for launching new blockchain bridges, possibly with the goal of increasing adoption and reducing barriers for users.
