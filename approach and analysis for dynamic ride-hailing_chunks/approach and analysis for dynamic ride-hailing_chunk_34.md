**Original Text:**

We consider this optional variation only
in settings without a maximum waiting time restriction, as we
have to ensure that all ùëõ requests will actually be matched. available vehicles. They assume that open requests will be queued
in a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) fashion until they are answered. In
this case, the next assignment will happen whenever the next vehicle
becomes available for assignment. However, assigning this vehicle to
the longest-waiting customer will most likely lead to bad assignments in
terms of distance or travel time. To prevent this, they propose to switch
from request-based to vehicle-based assignments and assign the nearest
request to the first available vehicle. With that, the first-come-firstserve principle is disregarded (which can lead to fairness concerns),
but the efficiency of the fleet is increased due to better assignments. This proves to be successful because efficiency is key in times of undersupply. Nevertheless, we do not consider this strategy in our study.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section provides detailed technical details regarding dynamic dispatch and vehicle-based assignment strategies for ride-hailing systems.

**1. Exact technical details:**

* Dynamic dispatch refers to the process of assigning vehicles to customer requests based on their availability and preferences.
* Vehicle-based assignments involve switching from request-based to vehicle-based scheduling, where each request is matched with the nearest available vehicle instead of the first one in line (FCFS).
* The nearest request to be assigned is determined by calculating distances or travel times between vehicles.

**2. Connecting to or building upon the surrounding context:**

This chunk connects to the broader discussion on ride-hailing systems, real-time management, and simulation techniques. By discussing dynamic dispatch strategies, it highlights the importance of efficient and fair assignment methods in these systems, especially during times of undersupply. The text assumes a basic understanding of simulation models, particularly those used for demand forecasting and modeling.

**3. Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

* The chunk does not mention specific parameters or parameters that must be specified or calculated (e.g., vehicle capacities, distances between locations).
* It also does not impose any particular condition on the system or the data (e.g., maximum waiting time restrictions, availability of vehicles).

Overall, this section provides technical details and context for dynamic dispatch strategies in ride-hailing systems, emphasizing efficiency and fairness in assignment methods.
