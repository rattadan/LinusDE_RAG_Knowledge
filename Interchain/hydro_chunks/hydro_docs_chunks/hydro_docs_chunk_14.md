**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

To vote for bids with longer bid durations, you must extend your ATOM lockup to meet or exceed the required duration. Navigate to the Lockups page Choose the “Edit Lockup” option Confirm the transaction in your wallet

By aligning your lockup duration with bid durations, you can participate in the governance process and support the projects you believe in. ## Tribute
-------

Tribute are distributed at the end of each voting round based on the amount of voting power locked in support of each project by each user. Here’s how the process works:

A project posts a tribute to incentivize users Users lock-Up & vote Tribute is distributed based on the voting power

The more voting power you lock, the higher your voting power and the greater your share of the tribute. Tributes are financial rewards and can include tokens, liquidity, or other incentives based on the project’s offering. You may not receive tribute if:

The bid fails to meet the minimum vote threshold. The bid does not meet the minimum tribute floor.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the text chunk:

1. **Technical details and parameters:**
   - The section explains the voting mechanism in Hydro, specifically the requirement for users to extend their ATOM lockup duration to support bids with longer durations.
   - The user must navigate to the Lockups page, select "Edit Lockup," and confirm the transaction in their wallet.
   - The section also explains the process for distributing tributes, which are financial rewards paid to users based on their voting power.
   - The tribute process involves a project posting a tribute, users locking up and voting, and the distribution of tribute based on voting power.

2. **Connection to surrounding context:**
   - The section builds upon the previously explained components of Hydro, such as the voting mechanism, bid submissions, and reward distribution.
   - The text assumes the reader is familiar with the basics of Hydro and its components, focusing on the specifics of the voting process and tribute distribution.
   - The section is closely related to the "APRs and Rewards" section, where it discusses the financial incentives provided by Hydro to users.

3. **Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**
   - The user must have an existing lockup to extend or create a new one to support bids with longer durations.
   - The user must lock up and vote to receive tribute.
   - The bid must meet the minimum vote threshold and the minimum tribute floor to receive tribute.
   - The project must post a tribute and meet specific requirements for the bid to be eligible for tribute distribution.

Overall, the text chunk explains the process of voting for bids with longer durations and earning tribute rewards in the Hydro platform.
