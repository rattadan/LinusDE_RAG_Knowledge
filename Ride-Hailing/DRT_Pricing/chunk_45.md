## Chunk 45

**Original Text:**

During choice set generation (first 400 iterations), in each
iteration the share of agents who change their mode, route and departure time (innovative strategies) is set to 5% per
choice dimension. In the final 100 iterations, all agents select from their choice sets based on a multinomial logit
model. Utility parameters for the different modes are set similar to [9]. Simulation experiments. In different simulation experiments, the DRT mode is added as an additional mode of transportation as described in Sec.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're describing a process related to route choice modeling, specifically during the generation of choice sets for a decision-driven traffic routing (DRT) system. Here's a summary of what I understand from your description:

1. **Choice Set Generation**: This is the initial phase where agents' preferences are generated based on their previous choices. In this case, it involves setting a specific percentage (5% per choice dimension) for changing their mode, route, and departure time as innovative strategies.

2. **Final Iterations - Multinomial Logit Model**: After the initial generation of choice sets, agents select from these sets using a multinomial logit model to determine their next move. This is where the actual decision-making process comes into play, taking into account various factors that influence transportation decisions.

3. **Simulation Experiments with DRT Mode Addition**: The text mentions adding an additional mode of transportation (DRT) as another option during certain iterations of choice set generation. However, it does not specify what changes were made in the simulation experiments regarding this addition.

Given the detailed information provided, here's a possible summary of how these steps could be implemented:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize the choice sets with each agent having multiple routes and modes.
  - Randomly select an innovative strategy for each agent during the first 400 iterations to begin generating new choices.
  
- **Choice Set Generation** (400 iterations):
  - For each iteration, set a 5% change probability for agents' mode, route, and departure time as innovatives strategies.
  - Re-generate choice sets based on these updated parameters.

- **Final Iterations - Multinomial Logit Model**:
  - Use the multinomial logit model to predict which transportation option an agent should choose next based on their past choices.
  - The utility of each mode or route is determined similarly to [9].

- **Simulation Experiments with DRT Mode Addition**:
  - Add the DRT mode as another choice dimension during certain iterations of choice set generation (e.g., every iteration, depending on a parameter).
  - In these experiments, agents' decisions are modeled using the multinomial logit model, and the DRT mode's utility is also considered.

This summary captures the main elements involved in generating choice sets for transportation options with an added dimension of route choices. However, without further details on specific parameters (like the probability of switching between modes), it's challenging to provide a more detailed implementation plan or outcomes from these simulations.
