**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

neutrond q wasm contract-state smart $HYDRO_CONTRACT_ADDR '{"current_round": {}}' --node [NEUTRON_NODE_RPC]

Then, use the round and tranche IDs to query the proposals:

## Tribute Additions
-----------------

Projects can incentivize users to vote for their proposals by adding tributes to the bid they’ve submitted to the Hydro smart contract. Multiple tributes can be added to the same bid. Tributes are sent as any token amount that the Project is willing to pay to the proposal voters. These tokens will be locked in the tribute smart contract until the current round ends. If a bid is among the top N by voted power, the entire tribute becomes available for the voters to claim. Each user’s portion of the tribute is proportional to their voting power relative to the total voted power for that proposal. The tribute is refunded if a bid is not among the top N.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Processes**

1.  The command `neutrond q wasm contract-state smart $HYDRO_CONTRACT_ADDR '{"current_round": {}}' --node [NEUTRON_NODE_RPC]` is used to query the state of the Hydro smart contract.
    *   This command calls the `contract-state` function on the `wasm` module of the `neutrond` node.
    *   It queries the state of the contract at the specified address `$HYDRO_CONTRACT_ADDR` and retrieves the `current_round` variable.
    *   The output is likely to be the current round number, which is used in the subsequent steps.
2.  The query of proposals uses the round and tranche IDs.
    *   This suggests that the proposals are organized in a way that is tied to specific rounds and tranches.
    *   The exact structure of the proposals and how they are associated with rounds and tranches is not specified here.
3.  The described process of adding tributes to a bid involves:
    *   Sending tokens to the tribute smart contract, which are locked until the current round ends.
    *   If the bid is among the top N by voted power, the entire tribute becomes available for voters to claim.
    *   Each user receives a proportionate amount of the tribute based on their voting power relative to the total voted power for that proposal.
    *   Refunding the tribute if the bid is not among the top N.

**Connection to Surrounding Context**

The current text chunk builds upon the context by:

1.  Further developing the concept of tributes within the Hydro platform.
2.  Providing a specific example of how tributes work, including how they are added to bids and how they are claimed by voters.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints**

Based on the current text chunk, the following requirements, conditions, or constraints are mentioned:

1.  Tokens sent to the tribute smart contract must be locked until the current round ends.
2.  For a bid to be eligible for tributes, it must be among the top N by voted power.
3.  The amount of tokens received by a user from tributes is proportionate to their voted power relative to the total voted power for that proposal.

The chunk mentions that an "entire tribute is made available for voters to claim if a bid is among the top N results." However, "The tribute is refunded if a bid is not among the top N." which seems ambiguous. It would be clearer to state whether the refund is partial or not.
