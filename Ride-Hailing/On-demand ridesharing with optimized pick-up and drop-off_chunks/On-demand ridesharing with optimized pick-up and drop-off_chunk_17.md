**Original Text:**

As this is a dynamic problem (future requests are not known beforehand but affect the efficiency of the solutions), several
techniques have been proposed to include future expectations into current assignment decisions (Wallar et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2017;
van Engelen et al., 2018; Alonso-Mora et al., 2017). However, the literature that deals with users that move towards on-demand vehicles is not so extensive. Such papers can be
classified into two groups: those that integrate this idea into a general Mobility on-Demand (MoD) system that includes some
assignment model, and those that study simpler problems to obtain theoretical insights. Walking users have been integrated into non-shared MoD systems by Zhao et al. (2018), using time–space windows to model
feasible solutions. Meeting points, in which several users board or exit the system, have been proposed for “flex-route” systems, i.e.,
traditional transit lines with some flexibility to adjust their routes on-demand (Zheng et al., 2019; Pei et al., 2019).
