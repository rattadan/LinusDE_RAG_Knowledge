## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 9

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Yan et al.’s (2020) recent 7-county Minneapolis-Saint Paul simulations show how an
increase in trip density improves DRS, and fleet response times average less than 5 minutes for
calls across the region, across rural, suburban, and urban settings. A structured approach to
resolving the effect of trip densities on ride-sharing rates, AVO, and fleet VMT is absent in
literature so far and is therefore one of this paper’s objectives. Another objective has to do with curbside congestion, which has not been a significant problem
in most settings, in the past. Regulated curb access at large hubs, such as railway stations and
airports, has ensured reasonable flow of private vehicles, taxis and, more recently, TNC vehicles. Growing curbside congestion has resulted in many airports using dedicated parking areas for
TNC vehicles, which users must walk to. Denser cities like New York City and Washington, DC,
have busy street curbs, leading to adjacent-lane backups.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details behind Yan et al.'s (2020) research paper on the impact of trip density on ride-sharing rates and fleet vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The exact technical parameters described in this chunk include:

* 7-county Minneapolis-Saint Paul simulations: This refers to a controlled experiment or simulation that ran over a specific period, likely with a sample size of 7 counties.
* Average fleet response times for calls across the region: The authors report an average response time of less than 5 minutes for calls made by ride-sharing vehicles in each of the study locations.
* Structured approach to resolving DRS (Demand Response Services) and AVO (Average Vehicle Output): This suggests that the researchers used a systematic method to analyze the effects of trip density on these two specific metrics, likely within the framework of demand response services and average vehicle output.

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Providing technical details about the research methodology and statistical analysis conducted in Yan et al.'s paper.
* Connecting the topic of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) to real-world urban transportation systems and infrastructure, such as traffic congestion and parking needs.

The specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned include:

* The timeframe of 2014 to 2020: This indicates that the research was conducted over a period of time with specific temporal constraints.
* The use of structured approaches in Yan et al.'s paper, which is an objective discussed in the current text chunk.
