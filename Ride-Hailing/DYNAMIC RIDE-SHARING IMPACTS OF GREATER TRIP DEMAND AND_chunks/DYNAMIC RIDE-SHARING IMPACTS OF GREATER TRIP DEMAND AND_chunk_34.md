## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 34

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Benefits of aggregation is offset by serving half as many
trips. Smaller fleets have lower idle time and skew average travel times high by likely trying to
bundle and serve more trips. This result may be specific to the small region of Bloomington with
relatively short trip distances of 4 mi compared to the NHTSâ€™ 12 mi U.S. average. Larger regions
may not have trips ready to be bundled at all times of day or in all directions of travel. Figure 4 Changes in Total Vehicle-Miles Traveled and SAV Vehicle-Miles Traveled

Stops and demand-density improve AVO over an average travel day, but the significance of
stop-based aggregation of trips is best highlighted in the first subplot of Figure 5. Even a quartermile stop spacing increases aggregation during the mid-day off-peak, with hourly distanceweighted AVO increasing from 0.90 to 1.10, and is likely the dominant contributor to higher
daily AVO in a given scenario.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section provides technical details on two aspects of shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) fleet performance:

1. **Benefits of aggregation**: The text explains that the benefits of serving half as many trips with SAVs are offset by the fact that smaller fleets have lower idle time and skew average travel times high. This suggests that small regions or areas may not be able to serve all trips efficiently due to limited capacity.
2. **Stop-based aggregation of trips**: The text highlights the significance of stop-based aggregation of trips, particularly when using a quarter-mile stop spacing. It explains how even a small increase in stop spacing can lead to significant increases in Average Vehicle-Miles Traveled (AVOM) and Daily Average Volume (DAV).

In terms of context, this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding text by:

* Providing technical details on the benefits of aggregation and stop-based aggregation
* Discussing specific parameters such as trip distances, idle time, and average travel times
* Explaining how these factors can impact daily Average Volume (DAV) in SAV fleets

The requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk are:

* The availability of a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance
* The need for specific information extraction or analysis of particular studies
* The consideration of trends across the papers and their implications for SAV fleet performance.

Overall, this section aims to provide technical insights into the benefits and challenges of aggregation in SAV fleets, highlighting how stop-based aggregation can impact DAV.
