# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_3.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://polygon.technology/*

### Document Overview  
This content covers blockchain technologies and identity solutions from Polygon and Privado ID, emphasizing decentralized infrastructure, smart contracts, and open-source frameworks.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on Polygon’s blockchain, enabling automated processes.  
- **Avg. Cost per Txn**: Metrics for transaction efficiency in blockchain networks.  
- **Digital Identity**: Open-source infrastructure for secure, interoperable user verification.  
- **SSI (Self-Service Identity)**: Principles for decentralized, user-controlled identity management.  
- **Interoperability**: Support for cross-chain trust and credential sharing.  
- **Web Wallet**: No-code tools for managing credentials across devices.  
- **MIT/Apache Licenses**: Open-source software licensing models.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Smart Contracts**: Polygon’s ecosystem supports tens of thousands of dApps via modular frameworks.  
- **Privado ID Web Wallet**: Uses authenticators for secure credential access across devices without downloads.  
- **Open Source**: MIT/Apache licenses for code, with adherence to W3C and DIF standards for interoperability.  
- **Credential Reusability**: Users can reuse credentials in multiple applications, reducing friction.  

### Related Topics  
- **Blockchain Infrastructure**: Both documents discuss decentralized systems, connecting Polygon’s smart contracts with Privado ID’s identity solutions.  
- **Open Source Development**: Privado ID emphasizes open-source principles, aligning with Polygon’s modular framework.  
- **Interoperable Ecosystems**: Both emphasize cross-chain trust and credential sharing, though through different architectures.

Users can reuse their credentials in different applications. Reduce friction with best user experience for identity verification.

With Privado ID Web Wallet, your credentials are accessible across multiple devices using just an authenticator. No downloads, no installations.

Privado ID is an open source project under MIT/Apache licenses. We follow the SSI principles and implement W3C and DIF standards.

Why to choose one credential provider if you can benefit from an entire ecosystem of providers? Choose your trusted providers and accept credentials from all of them.
