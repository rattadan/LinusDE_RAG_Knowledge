## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different users on Osmosis.

First, Money_Printer888 starts with a holiday greeting and some emojis. That's probably just a friendly message, maybe not crucial for the summary unless the key points include community interactions. But the user wants key points and decisions, so maybe just mention the greeting briefly.

Then, Osmosis_statbot provides a support link. That's important because it's official support info. Should include that in the summary.

jasbanza mentions #safetytips. Not much detail here, but the tag itself is a key point about security tips.

griffin_web3 shares a Ledger support article link. Since there's a discussion about cold wallets later, this might be related. Also, xXWanderingMonkXx talks about hot wallets being safe if used diligently but prefers cold wallets. They mention using hot wallets for connecting to sites but keeping private keys on paper and using burner wallets for DeFi. That's a key point about wallet security practices.

griffin_web3 and BasementNodes mention Ledger, Keystone, and Trezor as compatible with Keplr. war_7z asks about cold wallets for Osmosis, and others recommend Ledger Nano X. So the decisions here are using cold wallets like Ledger for security, and specific wallet recommendations.

Discussions about not storing funds on CEXs, preferring cold wallets, and skepticism about rumors of exchange collapses. war_7z mentions Coinbase being rumored to collapse, but griffin_web3 compares it to Binance, highlighting caution with CEXs. The point here is about self-custody and avoiding risks with centralized exchanges.

war_7z asks which wallet to use between Leap and Keplr. griffin_web3 lists the top Cosmos wallets: Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation. So the decision here is recommending those wallets for new users.

Another support link from osmosis_news and a user asking about projects related to dApp, AI, automation, tg miniapp. Also, jasbanza has a Russian-looking message which translates to "Happy New Year 2024!" but might be a typo. The user kychuli tells someone to check the link above for support.

Putting this all together, the key points are:

- Holiday greetings from community members.
- Recommendations for cold

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the main topics from this text. The user wants a comma-separated list, so I need to identify the key themes or subjects discussed here.

First, looking at the messages, there's a lot of talk about wallets, especially cold wallets and hot wallets. People are discussing using Ledger, Keystone, Trezor, and mentioning Keplr, Leap, and Cosmostation as Cosmos wallets. There's a question about which wallet to use for Osmosis, so crypto wallets and their security are definitely a main topic.

Then, there's a mention of Coinbase and rumors about it being the next exchange to collapse. The discussion around CEX (centralized exchanges) and self-verification of assets comes up. So exchange security and maybe specific exchanges like Coinbase and Binance are topics here.

Osmosis itself is mentioned multiple times, including a link to Osmosis support and a tweet from Osmosis. So the Osmosis blockchain platform is a central topic. Also, there's a question about getting support, so maybe support resources or official sites are part of it.

Other things: the user "Money_Printer888" sends a holiday greeting with emojis related to Osmosis, so maybe a general holiday message, but that's probably not a main topic. There's a hashtag #safetytips, which ties into security practices. The mention of dApp, AI, and automation projects by another user might be a separate topic, but I need to see if it's connected. Since it's a single message, maybe it's a side topic but still relevant.

Putting it all together: The primary topics are crypto wallets (cold vs hot), Osmosis blockchain, exchange security (CEX risks, Coinbase, Binance), specific wallet providers (Ledger, Keystone, Trezor), and support resources. The #safetytips and discussions about asset verification also fit. The dApp/AI project mention might be a minor topic but still part of the extracted list.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. First, I'll go through each message one by one.

The first message from Money_Printer888 has a lot of holiday greetings and emojis like üéâ, üöÄ, üíπ. That seems positive, maybe they're excited about Osmosis or the holidays. The sentiment here is probably positive.

Then there's a message from osmosis_statbot providing a support link. It's straightforward and doesn't have any emotional language, so neutral.

jasbanza's message is just #safetytips. Again, a hashtag without context, so neutral. Another message from jasbanza says "–∏–ú—â–º—Ñ—ã–¥—â—Ç—à–ª 2024!" which looks like random characters or maybe a typo. Not sure, but since there's no clear meaning, I'll mark it as neutral.

griffin_web3 shares a Ledger support link. It's a link to support, so neutral. Then they mention only seeing Ledger and Keystone for Keplr. Discussing technical details, no clear sentiment, so neutral.

xXWanderingMonkXx talks about hot wallets being safe if used diligently but prefers cold wallets. They also mention using burner wallets for DeFi. This is a balanced view, discussing pros and cons, so neutral.

BasementNodes mentions wallet apps and Trezor. Technical discussion, neutral.

war_7z asks about cold wallets for Osmosis. They're seeking information, so neutral. Later, they mention using Leap for iOS and rumors about Coinbase collapsing. Expressing doubt about rumors and taking precautions. The sentiment here could be slightly negative towards Coinbase but overall neutral since they're just discussing preferences and precautions.

griffin_web3 comments on CEX risks, comparing Coinbase to Binance. They express skepticism about Coinbase, which is a bit negative. But it's still a discussion about personal preference, so maybe neutral.

xXWanderingMonkXx doubts rumors about an exchange collapse, which is a positive take on not believing negative rumors. But the context is about being cautious, so maybe neutral.

The osmosis_news shares a Twitter link, which is neutral. user_7164487109 asks about projects, also neutral.

Putting it all together, the main sentiments are a mix of positive (holiday greetings), neutral (technical discussions, support links), and some cautious or

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any explicit or implicit actions that need to be taken, decisions made, or steps to follow.

Starting from the top, Money_Printer888's message is a holiday greeting with emojis, so probably no action items there. Then, the statbot mentions visiting the support site, which is a direct link. That's an action item for users needing help. 

jasbanza's message is just #safetytips. Maybe that's a tag for a topic, but not an explicit action. Then griffin_web3 shares a Ledger support link. The context here might be about cold wallets, but the link itself is an action item for support. 

xXWanderingMonkXx talks about using cold wallets, hot wallets, and burner wallets. There's a mention of keeping the private key on paper and using burner wallets for DeFi. These are practices, so possible action items like "keep private keys on paper" and "use burner wallets for DeFi." 

griffin_web3 again mentions Ledger and Keystone for Keplr. So maybe "use Ledger or Keystone for Keplr" as a decision. 

BasementNodes says "Whatever the wallet apps let you use basically" and Trezor. Not sure if that's a decision or just a comment. 

war_7z asks about cold wallets for Osmosis, and others respond recommending cold wallets, specifically Ledger. So the user's question leads to a next step of using a Ledger Nano X. 

Another part where war_7z mentions using Leap for iOS because of ratings, and griffin_web3 lists Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation. So decisions here could be choosing Leap for iOS, or those three wallets. 

Also, war_7z heard Coinbase might collapse, so a next step could be avoiding Coinbase. 

I need to check all messages. The news bot shares a Twitter link; maybe that's a next step to check the tweet. 

user_7164487109 is asking about projects related to dApp, AI, etc., so that's a call for collaboration or inquiry. 

jasbanza's message is in Russian or another language, maybe not relevant. 

Putting it all together, the main action items
