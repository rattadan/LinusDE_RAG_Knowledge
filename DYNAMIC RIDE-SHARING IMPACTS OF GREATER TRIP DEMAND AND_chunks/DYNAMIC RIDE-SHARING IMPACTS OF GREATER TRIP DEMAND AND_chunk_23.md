## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 23

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

for vehicle disposal was also incorporated into
POLARIS, similar to prior work in POLARIS (Gurumurthy et al., 2020b, 2021) to use with the
5x and 25x scenarios, to stress test the fleet in light of boosted demand. Previous studies have established that DRS is also proportional to fleet size and availability (i.e.,
the ratio of travelers to SAVs), and is also a function of response time and maximum allowable
delay (Bilali et al., 2019; Gurumurthy et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2020). In order to separate these
effects from that of using PUDOs, fleet size is calculated to maintain a constant requests-tovehicles ratio in each scenario simulated, and response time (10 min) and allowable delay
thresholds (5 min absolute delay and 25% added delay) are held constant across all scenarios. Additionally, the direct effect of having to walk longer distances to a PUDO zone is also tested. Table 1 highlights all possible values chosen for these variables.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

* The chunk mentions "POLARIS" and "5x" and "25x" as names of models or datasets used in the analysis.
* It references "Gurumurthy et al." (2020b, 2021) and "Bilali et al." (2019; Gurumurthy et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2020)" as key authors and papers, indicating a scholarly context.

**Context:**

The current text chunk appears to be providing technical details about the simulation framework used to analyze the effects of Point-of-Use Dispensaries (PUDOs) on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. The chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

* Referencing previous studies (e.g., "Gurumurthy et al." (2020b, 2021)) and their work on POLARIS models.
* Indicating that the current study is part of a larger analysis focused on shared autonomous vehicles.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

The chunk does not explicitly mention any specific requirements or conditions. However, it assumes:

* Access to a research database or repository (e.g., "POLARIS") for data availability and access.
* Familiarity with technical terms related to simulation frameworks (e.g., POLARIS models) and their usage in studies on autonomous vehicles.

Overall, this chunk provides detailed technical information about the simulation framework used in the analysis, while also connecting it to the broader context of shared autonomous vehicle research.
