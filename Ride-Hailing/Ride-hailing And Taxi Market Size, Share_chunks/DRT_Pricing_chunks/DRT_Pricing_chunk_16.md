## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 16

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

**Original Text:**

In contrast to [4], the proposed approximation approach accounts for the specific
characteristics of the DRT module (for example the DRT pricing scheme) and only approximates the DRT mode,
whereas, all other modes are simulated without any modification. During the first n iterations, the DRT mode is only
simulated in detail every k iterations. In between these iterations, the DRT mode is simulated in a simplified way
without running the assignment of DRT vehicles and users on the network. Instead, user costs are approximated as
follows:
• The DRT trip travel time is calculated based on the beeline distance and an average beeline speed which is obtained from the detailed DRT simulation. The average beeline speed is updated every k iterations and considers
the time passengers spend inside the DRT vehicles as well as the time passengers spend waiting for a DRT
vehicle. • The DRT trip fare is computed in the same way as in the detailed simulation.
