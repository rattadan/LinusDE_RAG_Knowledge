### Document Overview  
This content outlines the Optimism Collective's vision for an equitable internet using the Superchain, emphasizes decentralized infrastructure, and details deployment platforms like Base and Fraxtal.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Retro Funding**: A mechanism to reward public goods via blockchain incentives.  
- **Superchain**: A decentralized infrastructure for a fair, global internet.  
- **Decentralized Governance**: Model based on "impact=profit" principles, where communities own and benefit from the network.  
- **Base & Fraxtal**: Deployment platforms for building and running blockchain networks.  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Critical for ensuring equitable access and avoiding centralized control.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Deployment Platforms**: Base (for chain deployment) and Fraxtal (for blockchain development).  
- **Retro Funding**: Rewards for public goods via token-based incentives.  
- **Superchain Architecture**: Modular, open-source codebase for interconnected blockchains, ensuring power distribution across the network.  

### Related Topics  
- **Vision Document**: Aligns with the overarching goal of an equitable internet using the Superchain.  
- **Superchain Dev Docs**: References the foundation for decentralized governance and infrastructure.  
- **Govern & Delegate**: Connected to the collective governance model described in the Vision.

The traditional web has inherited exploitative economic rulesets that limit power and influence in the hands of the few. The Optimism Collective aims to create a new internet that benefits all and is owned by all.

This internet will be sustained by rewarding public goods through Retro Funding.

The Optimism Collective is a new model of digital democratic governance. It is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by the axiom of impact=profit the principle that positive impact to the Collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.

Put simply, were forking capitalism.

A secure, equitable, and fair internet can only exist if it is built on decentralized infrastructure. Blockchains are the key, but they need a platform for global scale.

The foundation for a more equitable digital economy is an interconnected network of blockchains built on a modular, open-source codebase.

This system will distribute power more evenly across the Superchain, ensuring that no one can own the internet. Empowering values. Robust infrastructure. An economy where everyone thrives.
