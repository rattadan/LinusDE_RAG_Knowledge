ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Recent literature extensively explores the benefits of demandresponsive transport (DRT) services like ridepooling, often using simulation models to assess their potential. Despite recognising the
significant impact of pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) events on service
efficiency, existing studies commonly rely on assumptions for stop
times.
