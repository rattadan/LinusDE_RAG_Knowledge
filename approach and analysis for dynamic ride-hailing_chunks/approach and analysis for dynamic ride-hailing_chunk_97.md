**Original Text:**

A similar argumentation as before can be used
to explain this: The larger the fleet, the better a perfect strategy
can cover the service area in anticipation of future requests, thus
decreasing the waiting time for the customers. â€¢ For low-utilized fleets as well as for very short maximum waiting
times, the simple nearest strategy, which assigns an incoming request immediately to the nearest available vehicle, outperformed
matching-based approaches. This is due to the wasted waiting
time for the next matching epoch, while the benefit of such a

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining the concept of dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on the advantages and limitations of different strategies.

**Technical Details:**
The chunk mentions the following technical details:

* Dynamic dispatch refers to a strategy used to manage multiple vehicles in real-time to fulfill customer requests.
* The strategy involves assigning incoming requests to available vehicles based on their location and type (e.g., taxi, Uber).
* The goal is to minimize waiting times for customers while maximizing utilization of all available vehicles.

**Context:**
The chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

* Mentioning previous studies on dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems (e.g., Bischoff & Maciejewski, Braverman et al.).
* Providing an overview of various strategies used to manage multiple vehicles (e.g., nearest strategy, matching-based approaches).

**Requirements and Constraints:**
The chunk does not explicitly state any specific requirements or constraints. However, it is implied that the discussion is relevant to ride-hailing systems with:

* Multiple vehicles ( fleets) and varying demand
* Real-time customer requests and waiting times
* Optimizing utilization of all available vehicles

Overall, this chunk provides an introduction to dynamic dispatch strategies in ride-hailing systems, highlighting its advantages and limitations, and setting the stage for further discussion on specific topics.
