## Chunk 34

**Original Text:**

Travel demand consists of work and non-work trips by car, public transit, bicycle, ride and walk mode. The synthetic population is calibrated against real-world traffic data, i.e. car counts, modal split [8] and trip-distances
[1]. To improve computational performance, in this study, a 10% sample is used and the DRT fleet size and road
capacities are accordingly reduced. A detailed description of the applied case study is provided in Ziemke et al.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're referencing the European Commission's Horizon 2020 research project "Digital Road Transport (DRT)" and its associated work on improving traffic management systems. However, I'll focus on the aspects related to travel demand estimation.

The mention of a synthetic population calibrated against real-world traffic data suggests that the study is exploring methods for estimating travel demand using simulated scenarios, rather than relying solely on empirical data. The use of a 10% sample to reduce computational complexity also highlights the importance of efficiency in transportation planning and simulation models.

In the context of improving computational performance, reducing the number of samples can significantly impact model accuracy and efficiency. By applying case study methodologies or scenario-based approaches, researchers aim to create realistic representations of different travel patterns and scenarios, which are then used to inform policy decisions or optimize transportation infrastructure.

While specific details about the applied case study (Ziemke et al.) are not provided in your query, it's clear that this research project is investigating various aspects of travel demand estimation, including the use of synthetic populations, sample sizes, and simulation models.
