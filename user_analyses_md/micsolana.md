Legitness evaluation: The tweet is a satirical take, not a real proposal. The author is likely a public figure, maybe a political commentator or someone with a critical view on media and government. The account might be related to a project or ecosystem that criticizes such government control, perhaps in the context of social media or political commentary.

For the author's character: The communication style is sharp, critical, and sarcastic, indicating a personality that's outspoken and values freedom. Motivations might be to challenge authority and promote individual rights. Emotional patterns show a tendency to be confrontational, maybe with a focus on justice and fairness. Decision-making is likely based on principles rather than compromise.

Putting it all together, the author is likely critical of government overreach in social media, using satire to highlight the absurdity. The keywords would be related to free speech, satire, government control, social media, and political commentary.
