## Eureka - Chunk 12

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Eureka
Security properties
Depending on where it is deployed, IBC Eureka might have different security properties compared to the ones in IBC Classic. This is mainly because EVM chains do not have any form of governance, whereas Cosmos chains do. To improve protocol and fund safety at launch, IBC Eureka is going to launch in stages, delineated by improved security properties at each stage. â€‹
Launch stage (0)
At launch, IBC Eureka is going to be deployed on two blockchains: Ethereum and Cosmos Hub mainnet. On the Cosmos Hub side, the security properties remain the same as in IBC Classic - governance has ultimate control over the chain, light client and channels. On the Ethereum mainnet side, it is different - a security council will have control over contract upgradeability, pausing and light client upgrades.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is analyzing potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar General Messaging Protocol (GMP), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, Go Fast, and a mention of Security properties.

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Technical details:**
The chunk mentions two IBC protocols:
- **IBC Eureka**: This is a modified version of Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol that will be deployed in stages to improve protocol and fund safety at launch.
  - Launch stage (0): This refers to the initial deployment on Ethereum mainnet, with Cosmos Hub as the secondary blockchain.
  - Security properties: The security properties differ between the two blockchains:
    - Cosmos Hub side (e.g., Cosmos Hub mainnet): Governance has ultimate control over the chain. However, light client and channels have some security properties.
    - Ethereum mainnet side: A security council controls contract upgradeability, pausing, and light client upgrades.

**2. Context connection:**
This chunk connects to its surrounding context by providing an overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. It highlights the importance of understanding these failures to mitigate risks and improve protocol safety at launch.

**3. Requirements and constraints:**
The text does not explicitly mention specific requirements or constraints, but it can be inferred that the analysis is focused on improving the security properties of IBC Eureka across multiple blockchains, ensuring fund safety during deployment stages. The mention of "launch stage" (0) and "security council controls contract upgradeability" implies that there are specific requirements for governance and contract management.

**Key takeaways:**

- The text provides an overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols.
- It highlights the importance of understanding these failures to improve protocol safety at launch.
- The analysis focuses on IBC Eureka, with a mention of its security properties across different blockchains.
