# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_35.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.optimism.io/*

### Document Overview  
This content outlines legal restrictions and technical limitations for users of the Optimism blockchain, emphasizing security, experimental nature, and network risks.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Experimental Nature**: Services are experimental and not intended for primary use on the OP Mainnet.  
- **Wallet Security**: Users are responsible for safeguarding their private keys and seed phrases, with no liability for lost assets.  
- **Blockchain Technology**: Public blockchains are risky, subject to bugs, forks, and operational errors.  
- **Network Cost & Performance**: Transactions vary in cost and speed due to blockchain volatility.  
- **PFP Images**: A feature allowing users to generate images for their Web3 wallets, subject to specific legal constraints.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Restrictions**: Prohibition of building competitive websites/services on the Services.  
- **Wallet Security**: Users must manage their own wallets; the platform provides no recovery mechanisms for lost assets.  
- **Experimental Features**: The Services are a reference implementation and not guaranteed to function as OP Mainnet.  
- **Network Constraints**: Transaction costs and performance are variable and not guaranteed.  

### Related Topics  
- **Privacy Policies**: The wallet security clause connects to broader privacy and security guidelines.  
- **Technical Documentation**: The blockchain and network risks align with technical whitepapers or developer documentation.  
- **Legal Terms**: The "PFP images" restriction ties to legal clauses (Section 9(b)) in the Terms of Service.

to PFP images, to the extent permitted by Section 9(b));
- You shall not access or use the Services to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service; and
- You shall not remove or obscure any copyright or other proprietary notices on or presented through the Services (or on any content accessible on the Services).
- Experimental nature.The Services are experimental in nature. They represent an example reference implementation only. The Services are not intended to be used as a primary means of accessing or interacting with OP Mainnet.
- Wallet security and safekeeping.You are solely responsible for the safeguarding and security of your Web3 Wallets. If you lose your wallet seed phrase, private keys, or password, you may be forever unable to access your digital assets. Any unauthorized access to your wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of your digital assets. We have no involvement in, or responsibility for, storing, retaining, securing, or recovering your Web3 Wallet seed phrases, private keys, passwords, or digital assets, or for any unauthorized access to your Web3 Wallet.
- Blockchain technology.Public blockchains, and the technology underlying and interacting with cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, are experimental, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to a particular public blockchain (e.g., via forks) could disrupt these technologies irreparably. There is no guarantee that any of these technologies will not become unavailable, degraded, or subject to hardware or software errors, operational or technical difficulties, denial-of-service attacks, other cyberattacks, or other problems requiring maintenance, interruptions, delays, or errors.
- Network cost and performance.The cost, speed, and availability of transacting on public blockchain systems are subject to significant variability.
