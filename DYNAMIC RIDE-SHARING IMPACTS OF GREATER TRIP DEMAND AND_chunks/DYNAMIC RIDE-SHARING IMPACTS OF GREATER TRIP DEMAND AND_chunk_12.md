## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 12

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

POLARIS relies on transportation demand and supply models to synthesize and simulate
person and freight travel across large regions, such as the 20-county, 30-million persons Chicago
Metropolitan Area. Demand models include the population synthesizer that is sourced from
ADAPTS (Auld and Mohammadian, 2009, 2012), and several mode and destination choice
models. A time-dependent dynamic traffic assignment router (Verbas et al., 2018) is used to
equilibrate traffic across the network to obtain a dynamic user equilibrium, and each link follows
a mesoscopic traffic flow model (de Souza et al., 2019) that provides reliable link-level speeds
depending on congestion. SAV Operations

Gurumurthy and Kockelman
Gurumurthy et al.â€™s (2020b) SAV module was extended in this paper to include DRS and stopbased aggregation of incoming requests. The module provided functionality for simulating an
on-demand service that operates similar to present-day TNCs.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis:

1. Technical details: 
   - **Transportation demand models**: These are ADAPTS (Auld and Mohammadian, 2009, 2012), which likely refers to a software tool used for modeling population growth and distribution within areas.
   - **Mode and destination choice models**: These are unspecified in the provided text but might refer to methods used to estimate how people choose routes and destinations based on various factors such as traffic, road conditions, and personal preferences.
   - **Time-dependent dynamic traffic assignment router (Verbas et al., 2018)**: This is a software tool that uses data from various sources to assign traffic flow through the network in real-time.
   - **Mesoscopic traffic flow model (de Souza et al., 2019)**: A mesoscopic model likely refers to an intermediate-level modeling approach used to simulate traffic flow at the detailed level, considering factors like congestion and speed.

2. Context:
This chunk connects to the surrounding context by introducing a broader discussion of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) in transportation systems. It highlights the importance of understanding SAVs within the existing urban infrastructure, including their impact on transportation demand models, traffic assignment tools, and operational strategies for managing ride-sharing services.

3. Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:
- The reference list covers various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles and their effects on urban transportation systems.
- It provides a timeframe spanning from 2014 to 2020, indicating the scope of recent developments in SAVs.
- Key authors include K.M. Kockelman and J.W. Ward, which might imply that the referenced studies are influential or foundational works in the field.

The current text chunk is explaining how Polaris relies on transportation demand and supply models to synthesize and simulate person and freight travel across large regions, such as Chicago's Metropolitan Area. It specifically mentions ADAPTS (Auld and Mohammadian, 2009, 2012), mode and destination choice models, time-dependent dynamic traffic assignment router, mesoscopic traffic flow model, and a SAV module that incorporates DRS and stop-based aggregation of incoming requests.
