**Original Text:**

The benefit of a good
repositioning strategy differs depending on the fleet size, the ùê∑ùëÜùëÖ,
and the maximum waiting time. Figs. 5 and 6 show the service rates
and the waiting times for different fleet sizes and different problem
settings. For each setting and fleet size, the blank part indicates the
value without repositioning (the nearest parking lot strategy), and the

Fig. 6. Waiting times of nearest repositioning (blank) and best repositioning strategy
(striped) in different settings with different fleet sizes. striped part indicates the value with the best repositioning for this
setting. The difference between these values demonstrates the benefit
of repositioning. It can be observed that repositioning improves the
service rate more for small fleets than for bigger fleets. The waiting
time reduction induced by the repositioning, however, gets bigger
with increasing fleet size, especially regarding relative improvement.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining how dynamic dispatch and repositioning can improve service rates and waiting times in ride-hailing systems.

1. **Technical details**: The text mentions the following technical aspects:
	* Dynamic dispatch: This refers to the process of assigning rides to drivers based on demand, rather than fixed routes.
	* Repositioning: This involves moving vehicles from one location to another to optimize the allocation of drivers and improve service rates.
	* Service rate: This is a measure of how many rides can be completed per hour or per minute, indicating the efficiency of the system.
	* Waiting time: This refers to the time it takes for a ride to be assigned and start, which affects the overall experience of the rider.

2. **Context**: The text builds upon the surrounding context by discussing the importance of dynamic dispatch and repositioning in ride-hailing systems. It also highlights that these strategies can have varying benefits depending on fleet size, demand settings, and problem settings. This suggests that the reader should be familiar with the broader topic of ride-hailing systems and their management challenges.

3. **Requirements and conditions**: The text does not explicitly mention any specific requirements or conditions for the dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategy. However, it implies that there may be constraints such as:
	* Fleet size: The strategy's effectiveness might depend on the number of vehicles available.
	* Demand settings: Different demand scenarios may require different strategies to optimize service rates and waiting times.
	* Problem settings: Specific settings, like peak hours or road conditions, could influence the performance of dynamic dispatch and repositioning.

Overall, this chunk provides a technical explanation of how dynamic dispatch and repositioning can improve ride-hailing systems, while also highlighting the importance of understanding the broader context and potential constraints that may impact its effectiveness.
