## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. 

First, I need to parse through the messages. The first message from osmosis_statbot is a guide on how to stop scammers. It lists steps: Settings, Privacy and Security, then changing Phone number, Calls, and Groups & channels to specific options. That seems important for security settings.

Then kychuli mentions turning off calls for privacy. So reinforcing the same point about calls. 

The other messages are from user_1783563915. They talk about depositing AKT to Osmosis having a problem, getting DMs, and then comments on calls and gas. The gas part might be a transaction fee adjustment, but the user's main issue is about depositing. The DMs and calls are related to the scammer issue mentioned earlier.

Key points: Security steps from the bot and kychuli, user's problem with depositing AKT, and the user's experience with scammers contacting them. Decisions here would be adjusting privacy settings to block unwanted contacts. The user might be seeking help on the deposit issue, but the main decisions in the text are about privacy settings. 

I should structure the summary to highlight the security measures first, then the user's specific issues. Make sure it's concise, bullet points maybe. Avoid extra details like timestamps and usernames unless necessary. Focus on the actions taken or suggested and the problems mentioned.

**Summary:**  
- **Privacy Settings Advice:** To prevent scammer contact, users are advised to adjust privacy settings by blocking phone number visibility ("Nobody"), disabling calls ("Nobody"), and restricting group/channel access to "My contacts."  
- **User Concern:** A user reports potential issues depositing AKT tokens to Osmosis and mentions receiving unsolicited DMs and calls, indicating possible scams.  

**Key Decisions:**  
1. Implement strict privacy settings to mitigate scammer interactions.  
2. Investigate or address the reported deposit issue with AKT on Osmosis.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. So first, I need to go through each part of the text and figure out what the key points are.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's talking about how to stop scammers from calling or adding you to their groups. The steps mentioned are clicking on Settings, then Privacy and Security, and changing options like Phone number to Nobody, Calls to Nobody, and Groups & channels to My contacts. So the main topics here are related to privacy settings, specifically blocking scammers, adjusting phone number visibility, call privacy, and group/channel access. Maybe I can group these under a broader topic like "Privacy and Security Settings" or something similar.

Next, kychuli's message mentions turning off calls under privacy. That's reinforcing the call privacy topic mentioned earlier. So that's another point related to call privacy settings.

Then there are several messages from user_1783563915. The first one says they upped the gas and everyone's good. Gas here probably refers to transaction fees in a blockchain context, so that's a topic related to blockchain transactions or gas fees. The next message is "And calls wow" which might be a reaction to the previous discussion about calls, but not sure if that's a topic. Then they mention getting DMs (direct messages), which could relate to spam or unwanted messages. Finally, they ask about a known problem depositing AKT to Osmosis. AKT is probably a cryptocurrency token, and Osmosis is a blockchain platform. So that's about deposit issues with a specific token on a platform.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be:

1. Privacy and Security Settings (including blocking scammers, adjusting phone number, calls, groups)
2. Call Privacy (turning off calls, user's reaction to calls)
3. Unwanted Messages/Spam (getting DMs)
4. Blockchain Transaction Issues (gas fees, deposit problems with AKT on Osmosis)

I need to make sure these are the most relevant and distinct topics. Let me check again. The first message is definitely about privacy settings. The second one adds to call privacy. The user's messages talk about gas fees, which is a separate topic, then calls again, DMs, and deposit issues. Each of these seems

*Frequently mentioned terms:*

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. The user provided a series of chat messages and wants to know if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The first one is from osmosis_statbot giving instructions on how to stop scammers by changing privacy settings. That seems negative because it's about dealing with scammers, which is a problem. The user is being warned or informed about a threat, so that's probably negative.

Next, kychuli says, "for the calls #privacy you can turn them off." This is a brief suggestion about privacy settings. It's a factual statement, maybe neutral, but since it's addressing a problem (scammers), it could lean negative. However, the user is providing a solution, so maybe neutral? Not sure yet.

Then user_1783563915 messages: "I just upped the gas we all good." The phrase "we all good" sounds positive, indicating that things are okay now. So this might be a positive sentiment because they're resolving an issue.

Another message from the same user: "And calls wow." The "wow" could indicate surprise. Depending on context, maybe negative if they're surprised by the scam calls, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Could be neutral or slightly negative.

"Already getting DMs lol." The "lol" suggests a light-hearted reaction, maybe neutral or slightly negative. They're receiving unsolicited messages but are responding with humor, so maybe neutral here.

The last message: "Hi is there a known problem with depositing akt to osmosis?" This is a question about a potential issue. It's a concern, so negative, but since it's a question seeking information, maybe neutral. However, the fact that they're asking about a problem implies a negative context.

Now, considering all these. The main topic is about scammers and privacy issues, which is negative. However, there's a message that says "we all good" which is positive. The rest are either neutral or negative. The overall sentiment might be negative because the majority of the messages are about problems (scammers, DMs, possible deposit issues), but there's a positive note. However, since the user is discussing issues they're facing, the sentiment might lean more negative. The positive message is just one

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a chat conversation with several messages. I need to go through each message and identify any actions, decisions, or next steps mentioned.

First, looking at the message from osmosis_statbot. It's giving instructions on how to stop scammers. The steps are: Click Settings, then Privacy And Security, and change Phone number, Calls, and Groups & channels to specific options. These are clear action items because they're telling the user to do specific things. So each of those bullet points is an action item.

Next, kychuli's message says to turn off calls for privacy. That's another action item, even though it's a bit more concise. The user is advised to disable calls, which aligns with the previous message's instructions.

Then there are messages from user_1783563915. The first one mentions upping the gas and asks if everyone is okay. "Upped the gas" could be an action item, but I need to check if that's a decision made by the user or just a statement. Since they say "we all good," maybe it's a confirmation that they've taken an action, but it's a bit unclear without context. However, the user might consider "upping the gas" as a next step, so I should note that.

The next messages from user_1783563915 talk about getting DMs and mentions of calls. These seem like observations rather than action items. The last message asks if there's a known problem with depositing akt to osmosis. That's a question, so the next step here would be to check if there's an issue with deposits, maybe investigate or inform the user about it.

Putting it all together, the main action items are the steps from osmosis_statbot and kychuli to adjust privacy settings. The user_1783563915's messages include adjusting gas (though the context isn't clear) and addressing the deposit issue. I need to present these in a structured way, making sure to attribute each to the correct user and message time. Also, some messages might not have action items, just comments. I should only include the ones that are actionable or decisions made.
