## CosmosNetwork - Chunk 43

**Document Summary:**

This overview provides an excellent foundation for understanding Tendermint Core's architecture and its Application Binary Interface (ABCI). Let's break down the key components and their functionalities:

### 1. **Tendermint Core**
   - **Role**: Responsible for consensus, validation, and block propagation.
   - **Components**:
     - **Block Proposal**: Proposes new blocks based on transaction data.
     - **Commit Vote**: Collects votes from validators to finalize a block.
     - **Consensus Logic**: Implements BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) logic.

### 2. **ABCI Interface**
   - **Purpose**: Allows the application logic to interact with Tendermint Core.
   - **Primary Messages**:
     - **AppendTx**: Delivers transactions for validation and inclusion in blocks.
     - **CheckTx**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block (optional).
     - **Commit**: Computes cryptographic commitments of the current state.

### 3. **Application Logic**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Validate and process transactions.
     - Update application state based on transaction outcomes.
     - Respond to ABCI messages with appropriate responses.
     - Handle consensus-related tasks like reorg-proposals (if necessary).

### Detailed Breakdown

#### **AppendTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Delivers a transaction for validation and inclusion in the blockchain.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core receives a new transaction via the network.
  2. The transaction is passed to the application via `AppendTx`.
  3. Application validates the transaction against its state, protocol rules, and credentials.
  4. If valid, the application updates its internal state (e.g., UTXO database).
  5. Tendermint Core schedules the transaction for inclusion in a block.

#### **CheckTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core's mempool first checks each transaction with `CheckTx`.
  2. If the transaction passes, it is relayed to other peers for further validation.
  3. Validated transactions are then passed to application via `AppendTx` for state updates.

#### **Commit Message**
- **Purpose**: Computes a cryptographic commitment of the current application state.
- **Flow**:
  1. After processing all transactions in a block, Tendermint Core computes the commit state.
  2. This commit is signed by validators based on their voting power.
  3. The commit is then included in the next block header.

### Additional Features

#### **Validator Set Management**
- **Messages**: `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock`.
- **Purpose**:
  - `BeginBlock`: Passed to application at the start of each block, allowing it to update its state.
  - `EndBlock`: Passed after transactions have been processed, enabling finalization actions like reorg-proposal signing.

#### **Lightweight Client Support**
- **Commit Hashes**: Signed by validators, providing cryptographic proof of committed states.
- **Merkle Proofs**: Simplify verification for lightweight clients using block hashes and signed commit votes.

### Handling Byzantine Faults

1. **Forks**:
   - ≥ ⅓ Byzantine voting power can cause forks.
   - Detectable through inconsistencies in the state root, triggering social consensus mechanisms to heal the network.

2. **Censorship Attacks**:
   - > ⅔ Byzantine voting power can commit arbitrary invalid states.
   - Social consensus and legal measures are necessary for handling such failures.

3. **Reorg-Proposal Coordination**:
   - Signed by +½ of original validators, ensuring that external coordination is robust to network partitions.

### Conclusion
ABCI provides a flexible interface for integrating application logic with Tendermint Core’s consensus mechanism. By carefully validating transactions and updating state, applications can ensure consistency and reliability in blockchain operations. The ability to handle Byzantine faults through social consensus mechanisms further strengthens the overall system's resilience.

**Original Text:**

It is possible to address these issues by designing the bridge to be totally accountable. For example, all IBC packets, from the hub and the origin, might require acknowledgement by the bridge-zone in such a way that all state transitions of the bridge-zone can be efficiently challenged and verified by either the hub or the origin's bridge-contract. The Hub and the origin should allow the bridge-zone validators to post collateral, and token transfers out of the bridge-contract should be delayed (and collateral unbonding period sufficiently long) to allow for any challenges to be made by independent auditors. We leave the design of the specification and implementation of this system open as a future Cosmos improvement proposal, to be passed by the Cosmos Hub's governance system. Ethereum Scaling
Solving the scaling problem is an open issue for Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum nodes process every single transaction and also store all the states. link.
