NKN is a public blockchain running on open source software. The nRide team itself can run and manage a number of NKN
nodes connected to the main NKN network, so even if every
other NKN node were to go down, the NKN network would
still be functioning thanks to nRideâ€™s nodes. If security or scalability concerns were to appear on the
public NKN network, nRide could always run a private NKN
network accessible only to nRide users. 24

**LLM Contextual Output:**

NKN appears to be a decentralized blockchain-based network that utilizes a layer of computers to provide data transmission and connectivity to connected users. The fact that NKN is a public blockchain running on open-source software makes it more resilient to failures compared to traditional private blockchains.

The key benefits of NKN mentioned in the text include:

* A robust network that can continue functioning even if other nodes are down
* The ability to run its own nodes, which helps maintain the network's integrity
* Security and scalability concerns on the public NKN network can be addressed through nRide's private network

The text also highlights two potential use cases for nRide:

1. A decentralized communication system that could render a traditional internet unusable if nRide is unavailable.
2. A private network accessible only to nRide users, which could provide enhanced security and control over data transmission and connectivity.
