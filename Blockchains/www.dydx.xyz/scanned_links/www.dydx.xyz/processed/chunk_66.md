they seek to maximize potential gains in emerging growth segments. Traders are also more likely to trade in smaller and more speculative cryptocurrencies during bull runs as they try to capitalize on potential profits in digital assets. Sometimes, the mania of a bull market leads people to make rash emotional decisions and "panic buy" cryptocurrencies to avoid the fear of missing out (or "FOMO"). However, traders need to respond to bull markets appropriately and avoid excessive commitments and risk.Â  The markets can be extremely volatile and a bull market can turn into a âbearâ market very quickly as well as experience substantial declines in value.

Positive economic data and news are the key contributors to cryptocurrency bull runs. Traders must feel comfortable putting their money to work in cryptocurrencies rather than holding onto cash or investing in more well-established alternative sectors, such as bonds and precious metals. Due to the volatile and speculative nature of digital assets, some traders treat virtual currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as "high-risk" assets, and many aren't comfortable entering this space if the broader macroeconomic picture isn't pretty.

Typically, bull markets occur when traders feel confident the overall economy is growing thanks to positive gross-domestic-product (GDP) numbers, strong consumer confidence levels, and low unemployment. Bull markets also usually correlate with a lower interest rate environment from policymakers like the Federal Reserve (Fed), making it easier for traders and businesses to borrow funds and put money into cryptocurrency. All of these factors mean more people have extra capital to spend on assets like cryptocurrency, often leading to the higher trading volumes seen during bull runs.

There are also crypto-specific factors that drive trading activity in the digital assets sector.
