## Chunk 54

**Original Text:**

Also, expanding the DRT service area from the
inner-city area to the entire Berlin area allows for longer trips and yields an increase in average travel time and
average travel distance. For users switching from car to DRT, the average beeline travel speed is observed to decrease

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The text appears to be describing the details of a public transportation system in Berlin, specifically the Distance Reduced Transit (DRT) service, which provides an alternative to driving and includes a list of average travel times and distances for both inner-city areas and the broader Berlin area.

It seems that the DRT service is expanding its coverage to include more areas, allowing users to take buses with more convenient schedules and routes. This expansion can lead to increased travel time and distance, as you mentioned.

The table provided highlights some key statistics about the average travel times and distances for both inner-city and outer-outer Berlin areas:

* Inner-city area: 787 seconds (13.4 minutes) and 2,418 meters
* Outer-outer area: 1,352 seconds (22.7 minutes) and 5,912 meters

It's worth noting that the average travel times are relatively short compared to driving a car in Berlin, which can be around 30-40 minutes depending on traffic conditions.

Overall, the DRT service is likely designed to provide an efficient alternative to driving for many commuters in Berlin, while also promoting sustainability and reducing traffic congestion.
