## Chunk 8

**Original Text:**

The inherent tradeoff between the quality of the DRT service and its associated operating cost suggests that costs to the agency and users should be balanced through the design and management of the system. As a result, the optimal balance can be introduced as a condition of the system in which the total cost of the agency and users is minimized. Conventional paratransit services, such as those in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 to provide complementary transit service for people with disability, typically schedule trips for users in the order that they are requested. By limiting the number of requests per time that can be booked, the operator limits the scheduled demand for trips to the capacity of the system. There are two problems with the current operating strategy.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you've provided a passage discussing the challenges and limitations of conventional paratransit services, specifically under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. The issues mentioned include:

1.  Limiting the number of requests per time that can be booked by an operator to ensure it does not exceed the capacity of the system.
2.  This limitation may lead to inefficient use of resources as users are being scheduled in batches, potentially resulting in missed opportunities for service users.

These constraints highlight a tradeoff between optimizing service quality and managing operational costs.
