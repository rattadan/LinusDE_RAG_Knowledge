## Eureka - Chunk 15

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

As such, the security council will increase the minimum delay of the TimelockController to be longer than the time it takes to pass a governance proposal on the Cosmos Hub. This means that the security council will be much closer to becoming obsolete, while allowing the Cosmos Hub to override actions taken by the security council. ​
Pausing stage (2)
After a trial period of allowing the Cosmos Hub to govern the canonical Eureka deployments, the security council will revoke its’ rights and controls over canonical deployments, fully allowing the Cosmos Hub to take over its’ responsibilities. Token & Route Support Requirements
This document describes the steps you must complete for the Skip Go API to begin providing new routes for users to transfer a token over to various remote chains using IBC.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on this specific section of text, here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details and Parameters:**
The current text chunk outlines potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on the TimelockController (TLC), Axelar GMP (AGMP), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, Go Fast, short-term solutions, medium-term solutions, and long-term solutions. It also mentions the need for robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

**Context Connection:**
This chunk is part of a comprehensive overview document that aims to provide insights into potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. The surrounding context likely discusses the security council's role in ensuring the security and stability of cross-chain interactions, including its revocation of governance rights after a trial period on Cosmos Hub.

**Requirements and Constraints:**
The following requirements are mentioned:

1. **User Education:** Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:** Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:** Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

Overall, this section is providing guidance on mitigating risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers, highlighting the importance of understanding potential failure points and implementing measures to prevent or respond to them.
