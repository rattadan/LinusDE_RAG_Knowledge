### Document Overview  
This content discusses Codebase's second cohort of founders, emphasizing the importance of technical expertise, ecosystem interoperability, and the role of Ava Labs and AvaCloud in supporting their development.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Avalanche ecosystem**: Interoperable blockchains focused on decentralized applications (dApps) rather than individual companies.  
- **Technical expertise**: Founders require foundational knowledge of Avalanche’s consensus mechanisms and ecosystem, but can leverage Ava Labs’ tooling and resources.  
- **Ava Labs & AvaCloud**: Privileged access to technical resources and partnerships for developers.  
- **Interoperability**: The core value of the Avalanche network, enabling cross-chain communication and collaboration.  
- **Codebase cohort**: Selection of teams with diverse backgrounds and product ideas, prioritizing technical readiness and ecosystem alignment.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Tooling and resources**: Codebase founders rely on Ava Labs’ technical expertise and AvaCloud’s support to develop dApps without deep in-house development experience.  
- **Cohort structure**: 15 teams with varied backgrounds (students, entrepreneurs, Web3 builders) focused on products like B2B SaaS, stablecoins, and decentralized AI.  
- **Ecosystem integration**: Founders are encouraged to leverage the Avalanche ecosystem’s interoperability and partnerships for go-to-market strategies.  

### Related Topics  
- **Avalanche ecosystem architecture**: Connection to the broader Avalanche network and its interoperability features.  
- **Codebase program selection criteria**: Alignment with technical skills, ecosystem understanding, and product potential.  
- **Ava Labs’ role**: Collaboration with AvaCloud and other ecosystem partners to support developer capabilities.

Although founders are expected to have a basic understanding of Avalancheâs consensus mechanisms and the general thesis behind Avalanche9000 when they apply to Codebase, they donât need to have deep experience actually developing dApps on Avalanche. For that, they can rely on the technical expertise and tooling developed over the past eight years at Ava Labs. Codebase founders have privileged access to the Ava Labs team and key vendors within the Avalanche ecosystem such asAvaCloudthat will help them rapidly gain the technical skills they need to build their product.Â

For Martin, Cohort 2 underscored that deep technical experience building on Avalanche is equally as important as a solid understanding of the unique benefits of building on Avalanche compared to other L1 chains. âWe truly are an ecosystem of interoperable blockchains rather than a collection of companies building on a chain,â he says. âThat fundamental shift enables new business models and having that knowledge can unlock partnerships and go-to-market strategies much more quickly.âÂ

The Right Founders, the Right Problems, and the Right Network

Codebaseâs second cohort consisted of 15 teams from around the world with diverse backgrounds and product ideas. Some teams consisted primarily of college students building a startup for the first time while others consisted of more seasoned entrepreneurs and Web3 builders. The cohort brought a broad range of product ideas to Codebase that included everything from B2B SaaS and loyalty marketplaces for food and beverage to decentralized AI and stablecoin platforms.Â

Although the founders and products in Cohort 2 were eclectic, they all had important elements in common that helped crystalize the elements of a strong application to the Codebase program.
