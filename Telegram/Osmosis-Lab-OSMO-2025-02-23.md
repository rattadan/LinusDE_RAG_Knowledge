## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and figure out the key points and decisions. 

The text starts with osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's important for support info. Then BasementNodes and kychuli mention that an issue is acknowledged and being worked on, with a possible bigger problem. hleb_albau asks about Kava USDT updates. 

There's a discussion about liquidity pools: Me372848... suggests holding coins instead of using pools, and others like vveendettaa talk about CEXes preparing for a liquidity crunch. EmpowerWill mentions someone trying to boost Osmosis. 

CR202020 gives a strategy using a compound interest calculator to estimate OSMO needed for passive income, assuming 20% APR. They also joke about changing their name to Crypto Osmo. Sinzfeldt and ips14 discuss how "rich" and OSMO are opposites, and ips14 asks how much OSMO makes someone rich. 

jasbanza advises on what to do when a pool's price goes out of range: wait or adjust the position. Khuwarzmi and kychuli mention DMs for questions and the issue's status.

I need to condense this into key points: ongoing issue with Kava USDT, advice on liquidity pools, passive income strategy with OSMO, and the statbot support link. Decisions include acknowledging the issue, considering pool adjustments, and using calculators for OSMO planning. Avoid minor comments and focus on the main discussions and actionable advice.

**Summary:**  
- **Ongoing Issues:** A previously acknowledged issue with Kava/USDT liquidity is noted, with speculation it may be larger than initially thought (BasementNodes, kychuli, hleb_albau).  
- **Liquidity Pool Advice:** Users debate the value of liquidity pools, with some advising to hold coins outside pools to avoid risks (Me372848, vveendettaa) and others emphasizing factors like swap fees and rewards (kychuli).  
- **Passive Income Strategy:** CR202020 suggests using a compound interest calculator to estimate OSMO holdings needed for passive income, assuming ~20% APR.  
- **Price Range Management:** jasbanza advises

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the given text and present them as a comma-separated list. The text is a series of chat messages from different users on Osmosis, a blockchain platform.

First, I need to go through each message and identify the key topics or themes. Let's start with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a link to the support site. That's probably about support or help resources.

Next, BasementNodes mentions that an issue was acknowledged and being worked on. So that's an ongoing issue or problem resolution. Then kychuli talks about a bigger issue than initially thought, and asks others if they know more. This might relate to a technical problem or a community concern.

hleb_albau asks about "kava usdt". Kava and USDT are cryptocurrencies, so this is likely about cryptocurrency pairs or liquidity issues. Then kychuli responds to someone else discussing whether something is a waste of time, depending on factors like pairs, price movements, swap fees, rewards. This seems related to investment strategies or yield farming.

Me372848228924729387 advises holding coins without using pools and stopping pool usage. So that's about liquidity pools and investment advice. vveendettaa mentions a similar event a week ago and CEXes preparing for a liquidity crunch. CEXes are centralized exchanges, so this could be about market trends or liquidity concerns.

EmpowerWill talks about someone trying to buy up Osmosis, which relates to market activity or potential takeovers. CR202020 provides a compound interest calculator link and discusses changing their name to Crypto Osmo, indicating interest in financial calculations and community engagement.

Sinzfeldt makes a joke about Rich and Osmo being antonyms, touching on wealth and cryptocurrency. Another message from osmosis_statbot again about support. ips14 mentions not dollars but OSMO, and asks how many OSMO make one rich, so that's about wealth in cryptocurrency and community discussions.

Khuwarzmi suggests asking a question in DMs, which is direct messaging, so maybe community interaction. jasbanza explains what to do when price goes out of range in pools, which is technical advice on liquidity pools. CR202020's question about price going out of range and pool management

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a series of chat messages from Osmosis and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. I need to go through each message and figure out the sentiment, then see how they balance out.

First, the osmosis_statbot messages are just support links. They don't have any emotional tone, so those are neutral. Then there's BasementNodes saying "nope just that it was acknowledged and being worked on." Neutral again, just a factual update.

Looking at kychuli's messages: "not particularly, i heard that it was a bigger issue..." Hmm, mentions a bigger issue, which could be negative. But they're asking for more info, so maybe not strongly negative. Then hleb_albau asks about Kava USDT updates‚Äîneutral. Another kychuli message says "if it was a waste of time nobody would ever do it" which is responding to someone else's negative comment. So that's positive? Or just counter-argument. Maybe neutral.

Me372848228924729387 tells others to stop using pools and says they're a waste of time. That's clearly negative. vveendettaa mentions CEXes prepping for liquidity crunch with an up arrow. Wait, a liquidity crunch is usually negative, but the up arrow might indicate a positive movement? Or maybe they're speculating on a positive outcome. The first part about a similar event a week ago is neutral.

EmpowerWill says someone is trying to buy up Osmosis. That's positive, indicating interest. CR202020 provides a compound interest calculator link and jokes about changing their name to Crypto Osmo. The calculator part is neutral, the joke is positive. Sinzfeldt says "Rich and osmo are antonyms" which is a play on words. That's probably negative, implying OSMO won't make you rich.

ips14 asks how many OSMO makes someone rich, and another says "not dollars, only OSMO üòé" The first is a question, maybe neutral, the second with a smiley could be positive. Khuwarzmi's message is friendly, offering to answer in DMs, so neutral. Jasbanza explains what to do when price is out of range, neutral advice. CR202

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see if there's anything actionable.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's a helpful link but not an action item from the conversation participants. Then BasementNodes says something is acknowledged and being worked on. That's more of a status update, not a specific action item.

kychuli mentions they heard it's a bigger issue but not much more. They ask @clemensg or @BasementNodes for more info. So here, the action item would be for clemensg or BasementNodes to provide more details. But since the user is asking for extraction from the given text, I need to check if that's part of the provided messages. The text doesn't include a response from them, so maybe just noting that kychuli is seeking more info.

hleb_albau asks about Kava USDT. That's a question, but unless there's a response indicating a next step, it's just an inquiry. Then kychuli responds to someone else's message about pools not being a waste of time, depending on various factors. There's a discussion here about pool efficiency but no clear action item yet.

Me3728482... tells others to stop using pools and hold coins instead. That's a suggestion, but unless someone agrees to do it, it's just advice. So maybe the action item here is for the user to consider stopping pool usage, but it's a recommendation from another user.

vveendettaa mentions something similar happened a week ago and talks about CEXes prepping for a liquidity crunch. Again, that's information sharing, not an action item. 

EmpowerWill notices someone trying to buy up Osmosis. That's an observation, no action item.

CR202020 shares a link to a compound interest calculator to help determine OSMO needed for passive income. They also joke about changing their name. The link is a resource, but the actionable part is using the calculator to figure out OSMO amounts. So the action item here would be for users to use the provided calculator to plan their passive income.
