## Chunk 64

**Original Text:**

Governance
Governance is an important aspect of the nRide ecosystem, and the nRide token is the key to decentralized
decision-making. The nRide protocol is open-source, and the nRide DAO is responsible for managing the
treasury and making decisions regarding the future direction of the platform. The DAO is governed by token holders, who can vote on proposals that will shape the evolution of nRide. Token holders have the opportunity to propose changes to the protocol or initiatives that could benefit the
community. Proposals can include changes to the messaging protocol, the escrow mechanism, the registry,
or any other aspect of the platform.
