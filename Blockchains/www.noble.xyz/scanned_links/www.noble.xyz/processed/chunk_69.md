### Document Overview  
The content highlights Noble's plans to integrate USDC and native asset issuance on the Celestia ecosystem, introduce an app-layer for asset issuance, and celebrate community engagement through token distributions.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Interchain**: A blockchain network enabling cross-chain communication and interoperability.  
- **App-layer**: A layer of the blockchain where applications (e.g., asset issuance) run, distinct from the core consensus layer.  
- **USDC**: A stablecoin (USD-pegged) used for transactions and value storage.  
- **Celestia**: A decentralized blockchain platform focused on scalability and interoperability.  
- **FRNZ**: A token distributed to celebrate community engagement.  
- **Cosmos SDK**: A framework for building decentralized applications (DApps) on top of the Cosmos network.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Noble AppLayer**: A blockchain layer built on Celestia, enabling native asset issuance (e.g., USDC) and interchain transactions.  
- **Interchain Integration**: Noble’s platform is designed to operate on the Interchain network, facilitating cross-chain communication and token transfers.  
- **Token Distribution**: FRNZ tokens are distributed via a community-driven initiative to reward active participants.  
- **Cosmos Wallet Setup**: A beginner’s guide outlines steps to set up a Cosmos wallet for USDN purchases, highlighting the technical infrastructure required for interoperability.  

### Related Topics
