Legitness: The accounts are likely legitimate, as they're talking about established projects like Balancer and Delta. The links are from verified sources.

Ecosystem: Balancer is a DeFi project, so the account is promoting that. The second tweet mentions Optimism, which is a layer 2 blockchain, so it's part of the DeFi ecosystem.
