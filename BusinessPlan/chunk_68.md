**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided information, I'll outline a potential budget breakdown for nRide's expansion plans:

**Fixed Expenses/Budget:**

1. Computer Hardware and Software: $37,500.00 (part of startup costs)
2. Web Development: $0.00 (no expenses listed for this project)
3. Reserve for Unplanned Expenses: $17,500.00
4. Marketing Expense: $3,062.50

**Total Fixed Expenses/Budget:** $57,562.50

**Salaries & Wages:**

1. Blockchain Developer with Rust experience:
	* Salary: $91,000 per month
	* Percentage Allocation: 26% of total salary (part of monthly expenses)
2. Marketing Expenses for the Blockchain Developer:
	* Effort budget: $3,500 per month
	* Allocation: 20% of marketing expenses ( part of monthly expenses)

**Total Salaries & Wages:** $91,000 + ($3,500 x 0.20) = $92,700

**Grants:**

1. Grants are not listed in the provided data.

**Other Funding/History:**

1. Other funding is included as a separate row with no details.

**Total Other Funding/History:** $0.00

**Total Startup Funding:** $350,000.00 + $349,998.50 = $699,998.50 (Round 1)

**Net (Funding - Costs):**

$699,998.50 - ($57,562.50 + $92,700) = -$41,550.50

This leaves nRide with a net funding requirement of approximately $41,551.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible breakdown and actual expenses may vary based on the specific needs and requirements of nRide's expansion plans.
