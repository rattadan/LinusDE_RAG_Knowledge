## Eureka - Chunk 50

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

When the Relayer comes back online after 8 minutes, it relays a timeout message to Osmosis, releasing the user’s STRIDE, which gets forwarded to their Osmosis address
In a post-swap error, the user will end up with their destination asset tokens in their address on the chain where the swap took place (e.g. STRIDE on Osmosis in this example)
In a post-swap error, the user will end up with their destination asset tokens in their address on the chain where the swap took place (e.g. STRIDE on Osmosis in this example)

​
Axelar Failures
Axelar transfers can be tracked on Axelarscan. Often, Axelar transfers are delayed by Axelar’s relayer or execution services. If a transaction is taking longer than expected, users can visit Axelarscan, find their transaction, and manually execute the steps needed to get the transfer through. See the Axelar docs for details on how to use Axelarscan. Internally, the Skip Go API may use Axelar’s General Message Passing service to move assets between EVM and Cosmos.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides detailed information about potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast.

### Technical Details/Parameters:

1. **Timeout Mechanisms**: The text mentions that timeout mechanisms are used to prevent users from losing funds due to delays in transactions. This is particularly relevant for IBC, where timeouts can occur.
2. **Packet Tracking**: The idea of adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early is also discussed as a potential short-term solution.
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms are recommended to mitigate risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

### Connection to or Building upon Surrounding Context:

This chunk builds upon the broader topic of cross-chain asset transfer protocols, providing technical details on specific failure points. It also connects these technical aspects to the overall context by discussing implications for users, developers, and relayers/int execution services.

### Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:

1. **User Education**: The text emphasizes the importance of informing users about potential failure points and their consequences.
2. **Risk Management**: Users need to be prepared for potential delays or failures, and developers should implement robust error handling mechanisms to mitigate risks.
3. **Developer Best Practices**: Implementing fallback mechanisms and other best practices can help ensure developer success in cross-chain applications.

Overall, this chunk provides a detailed understanding of technical aspects related to cross-chain asset transfers, including failure points, risk management strategies, and recommendations for developers and users.
