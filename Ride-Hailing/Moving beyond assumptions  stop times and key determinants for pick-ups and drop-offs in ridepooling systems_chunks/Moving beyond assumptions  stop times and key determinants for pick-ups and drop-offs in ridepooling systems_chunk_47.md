**Original Text:**

Key determinants, such as the dwell movement (pick-up or drop-off), the number of passengers, and the presence of bulky luggage, are typically known prior to each
stop event – as this information can be given when booking a trip, e.g. see MOIA (2024b),
ÜSTRA (2024), Uber (2024), Lyft (2024) – enabling better estimations of stop duration. When interpreting the results, it is important to acknowledge the sample size and variability of our empirical data. Some findings are based on infrequent occurrences, such
as the presence of elderly passengers or groups of passengers. Although these cases are
exceptional, we can still derive impressions regarding their impact on stop times. While our
dataset is limited, our study provides interesting and detailed insights into the determinants influencing ridepooling PUDO events, offering valuable empirical findings that are
necessary for advancing future DRT investigations toward greater realism.
