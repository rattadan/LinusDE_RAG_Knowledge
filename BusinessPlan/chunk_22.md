nRide Protocol - Application Developers
6

The developer community is a broad community that covers many sectors. The nRide protocol, in theory,
could be leveraged to make an infinite number of feasible applications, so a large pool of developers can
leverage the nRide protocol, however, in alignment with our GTM strategy and for an initial focus for our
BD team, our addressable market will include Web3 developers; with no particular category in mind (i.e
DeFi, Infrastructure, etc), and gig economy app developers. The Web3 developer ecosystem can be
defined by the number of downloads for essential libraries for Web3 app development and smart contract
deployment. From 2021 to 2022, the number of weekly downloads for essential Web3 libraries like
Ethers.js and Web3.js increased by 178% to 1,536,548 downloads per week, and continues to grow in
spite of “crypto winter” conditions (Alchemy, 2022).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're discussing the development of a new application or protocol that can be leveraged by various developers across different sectors. The mention of the nRide Protocol and its potential to enable multiple applications resonates with your goal of creating an addressable market.

To further elaborate on this, it appears you're focusing on partnering with web3 developers who haven't yet acquired a critical user base but can benefit from the nRide Protocol's features. This strategy aligns with your goals of expanding your GTM (Go-to-Market) strategy and initial focus for your BD team.

The growth in downloads for essential Web3 libraries like Ethers.js and Web3.js indicates a promising area to tap into. Even during "crypto winter" conditions, the demand for these libraries continues to rise. This suggests that there's still significant interest in developing applications on top of Web3.

To further explore this opportunity, you may want to consider the following:

1. Researching web3 developer communities: Look into platforms like Ethers.js GitHub repository, Web3.js GitHub repository, and their active user bases.
2. Identifying potential application ideas: Consider what types of applications or services would be built on top of these libraries that could benefit from nRide Protocol's features.
3. Developing a go-to-market strategy: Outline your plans for reaching web3 developers, such as attending conferences, creating informative content, and leveraging social media channels.

By doing so, you can capitalize on the growth in Web3 library downloads and create an addressable market that aligns with your goals of expanding your BD team's focus.
