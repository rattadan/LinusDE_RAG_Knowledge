### Document Overview  
This content outlines the arbitration rules and procedures governed by the American Arbitration Associations (AAA) for consumer disputes, including details on dispute resolution, location selection, and enforceability of decisions.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Arbitration Agreements**: Legal contracts for resolving disputes outside of court.  
- **AAA Rules**: Standardized procedures for resolving consumer disputes.  
- **Enforceability**: Arbitrator decisions are legally binding and can be overturned in limited circumstances.  
- **Location Selection**: Arbitration hearings are conducted in convenient locations, with mediation by the AAA if parties cannot agree.  
- **Telephonic/Document-Based Arbitration**: Options for resolving disputes without in-person hearings, subject to specific thresholds.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Location Determination**: Arbitration hearings occur in a "reasonably convenient" location, with AAA oversight if parties cannot agree.  
- **Threshold for Document-Based Arbitration**: Claims under $10,000 allow parties to choose arbitration methods (documents, telephonic, or in-person) as per AAA Rules.  
- **Enforceability**: Arbitrator decisions are enforceable in court but may be overturned for "very limited reasons" (e.g., procedural errors or fraud).  
- **Arbitrator Authority**: The arbitrator has sole authority to decide scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the agreement.  

### Related Topics

American Arbitration Associations (AAA) rules and procedures, including the AAAs Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the AAA Rules), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAAs consumer arbitration page,https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Unless Offchain Labs and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Offchain Labs agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
