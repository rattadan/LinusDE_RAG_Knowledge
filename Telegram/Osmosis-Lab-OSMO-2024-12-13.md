Looking at the text, there are several issues and topics mentioned. The main ones seem to be around transaction problems, like transfers not showing up, long withdrawal times, and error codes. For example, ROCK_THE_COUNTRY had a swap from btcbr to BNB that didn't appear in their wallet. Evgeny_Manyashin had a transaction error with Nolus to Osmosis chain, getting a 500 code. Then there's tonynotonydld with a Bitcoin withdrawal pending for 6 hours. griffin_web3 mentioned that transactions are taking longer through Nomic, maybe 12-24 hours, and suggested trying a hard refresh or using SquidRouter.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided chat messages as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or specific issues mentioned.

Starting with the first message, someone is asking about a code they don't recognize. That seems like a support request. Then there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing to support site, which is about support resources. Griffin_web3 and ROCK_THE_COUNTRY are discussing a token swap issue from BTCBR to BNB not showing up in the wallet. That's a transaction problem.

Another user, oldi6, is asking about opening new positions on CL pools from mobile and Polaris having charts. So CL pools and Polaris integration are topics. BasementNodes mentions retail CL management being deprioritized, which relates to CL pools as well. Czarcas7ic talks about an alpha rollout in January and a waitlist, so that's about product updates or rollouts.

Evgeny_Manyashin has a transaction error when transferring Nolus to Osmosis, which is another transaction issue. BasementNodes and JohnnyWyles87 discuss transaction delays related to batching and Nomic, so that's part of the transaction problems too. Kekmaster1234 is asking about changing validators after a delegation mistake, which is about staking and validators.

Edward_Exolix is reaching out for cross-promotion opportunities, which is marketing or partnership. Jasbanza mentions scams and verifying with Davidjgoosey, so that's security or scam warnings. Money_Printer888 asks about creating meme coins on Cosmos, leading to topics like meme coin creation and Token Factory. Kychuli provides links related to Token Factory, reinforcing that.

Vveendettaa and Khuwarzmi mention Polaris integration and its timeline, so Polaris development updates. Cryptologer0 and Profesija are asking about Osmosis reaching a new all-time high (ATH), which is price speculation. Money_Printer888 also asks about user-friendly platforms, which might be related to wallet or DEX usability.

Other messages include general discussions about DeFi trends, Trump's inauguration affecting altcoins, and some off-topic comments. I should focus on the main topics that are repeated or central to the support and development aspects. I need to ensure each topic is distinct and not redundant. Let me compile them now.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message in the chat and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The user wants the overall sentiment analyzed, so I should look at each line and then summarize the total.

Starting with the first message: "Does anyone know this code?" That seems like a request for help, so maybe neutral. The user is asking a question but not expressing strong emotions.

Next, the osmosis_statbot links to support. Since it's a bot providing assistance, that's neutral. It's just information.

Then, "On Osmosis?" by griffin_web3. That's a short question, probably neutral as well.

ROCK_THE_COUNTRY says they made a swap but couldn't find the token. This sounds negative because they're having an issue with their transaction. Frustration or concern here.

Griffin_web3 again: "Yes, what's up?" Neutral, just responding to a question.

ROCK_THE_COUNTRY asks if anyone is here to help. Again, a request for assistance, so neutral. Not necessarily negative unless they're upset, but the message itself is straightforward.

BasementNodes mentions CL management is deprioritized. "Deprioritized" might indicate a negative sentiment here, as it's a complaint or a statement of disappointment.

oldi6 asks about opening positions on mobile and hopes for charts in Polaris. The hope is positive, but the question itself is neutral. Wait, "hope" might lean positive a bit.

Czarcas7ic talks about an alpha rollout in Jan and waitlist. Neutral, just sharing information.

Griffin_web3 says "Happy to helpü§ù" which is definitely positive. The handshake emoji adds to that.

Evgeny_Manyashin says "it works ty sir" ‚Äì positive with thanks.

Griffin_web3 suggests a hard refresh and trying Squid. Neutral, providing solutions.

Evgeny_Manyashin has a transaction failed with error 500. Negative because of the problem encountered.

BasementNodes jokes about not asking to see logs. Neutral, maybe a bit negative but more dismissive.

JohnnyWyles87 doubts the batching issue. Negative, as they're skeptical about the solution.

BasementNodes again on batching txs. Neutral, discussing possible reasons.

JohnnyWyles87 mentions raised with Nomic and comparison to CEX. Negative, since they

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify any that indicate a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a next step in a process.

Starting with the first message: namuapo is asking if anyone knows a code. Not sure what code, but maybe related to a transaction? Not an action item yet. Then osmosis_statbot directs users to the support site. That's a standard help prompt, maybe not an action item unless someone follows it.

griffin_web3 asks "On Osmosis?" which seems like a question, not an action. ROCK_THE_COUNTRY mentions making a swap from btcbr to BNB and not finding the token. They might need to check the transaction or contact support. Their next step could be to seek help, maybe via the support site mentioned earlier.

BasementNodes talks about retail CL management being deprioritized. That's a statement about priorities, but not an action item. oldi6 asks about opening new positions on CL pools from mobile. That's a feature inquiry; the next step for the team might be to address that, but no decision is mentioned here.

Czarcas7ic mentions an alpha rollout in Jan and suggests adding to a waitlist. So, the next step for users is to join the waitlist, and the team's plan is an alpha in January. oldi6 also asks when Polaris will be live. The previous message from Khuwarzmi says Polaris is in H1 2025, so that's a decision or next step timeline.

griffin_web3 offers to help and suggests a hard refresh and trying Squid. So, action items for Evgeny_Manyashin would be to do a hard refresh and use Squid. Evgeny had a transaction error with Nolus to Osmosis chain, so the next step is troubleshooting via those methods.

Other messages like tonynotonydld's Bitcoin withdrawal taking 6 hours, BasementNodes mentions it taking 12-24 hours. The team's response is that it's going through Nomic, so maybe users need to wait or check with Nomic. Not a decision, but a status update.

kekmaster1234 asks about switching validators after unstaking. jasbanza explains
