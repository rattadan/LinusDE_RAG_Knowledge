## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. First, I need to parse through the messages to identify what's important.

Looking at the text, there's a proposal from CryptoGopniks to whitelist their address for uploading contracts to Osmosis. They mention building onchain apps in Cosmos, specifically NFT Lending, Staking, p2p trading, cases, etc. They developed new Cases for The Sevens ($T7S token) and need to upload existing contracts. The team's credibility is highlighted with M.Daeva as the team lead who worked on other projects. So that's a key point about their request and team trustworthiness.

Then there's a mention of Mars Protocol's Perps Vault offering ~70% APY on $USDC from trading fees, not emissions. That's a significant announcement about earning opportunities. 

Another part is WimOG010 talking about using the Osmosis Pay module successfully for online purchases and vending machines, and also mentioning the "golden triangle" of Osmosis/Keplr/Ledger. This shows user experiences and tools in use.

Mo66love and mikebarb discuss staking rewards for OSMO. Mo66love asks about future rewards, and mikebarb clarifies that currently, rewards are from inflation and taker fees. This relates to staking incentives.

Other messages are support links, a question about official customer service, and some unrelated comments. The summary should exclude those unless they're part of a decision or key update.

I need to structure the summary by highlighting the main proposals, decisions, and notable announcements. The key points are the whitelist proposal by CryptoGopniks, Mars Protocol's APY offer, Osmosis Pay module usage, and staking rewards info. Also, mention the team's credibility. Avoid the support links and casual comments unless they contribute to the main points. Make sure it's concise, bullet points if possible, but since the user didn't specify, a paragraph format is okay. Check for any other important details I might have missed. Alright, that should cover it.

The tone here seems informative and positive, highlighting their developments and trust in the team.

Next, "osmosis_statbot" has a message directing users to the support site. That's neutral, just providing assistance. Then "Sandro20212" talks about earning 70% APY on USDC through the Mars Perps Vault. High APY usually attracts positive sentiment, especially emphasizing it's real and powered by protocol revenue. Words like "Yes" and "raw trading fees" add to the positive vibe here.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's any explicit or implicit action required.

Starting with the latest message from jasbanza, it's a link to a Twitter post. The content mentions a proposal to whitelist a CryptoGopniks address for uploading contracts. The key action here is the request for whitelisting, so that's an action item for Osmosis governance or the relevant team.

Next, osmogovbot's message is about a forum post. The user subAtom is asking to whitelist their address. Again, same as above, the action is for the Osmosis team to consider this request.

Then there's osmosis_statbot's support message. It's a standard link to their support site, so maybe not an action item unless someone needs to visit it. But since the user is asking to extract actions, this might just be a reference.

Sandro20212 talks about earning APY on USDC through the Mars Perps Vault. This seems informational, but maybe the action here is for users to check out the vault if they're interested in LPing. However, it's more of a promotional message than a direct action item.

Ghost_Mountain7x mentions creating tools and being open to collaboration. The action here could be reaching out or discussing potential partnerships, but it's a bit vague. Maybe note it as a next step for interested parties to connect.

WimOG010's messages: changing to "trinity" and using the golden triangle. These are more updates or status reports, not actions. Unless someone needs to follow up on the change, but it's not clear.

Hleb_albau's question about "rectangle" in the context of a compromise. This is a query needing a response, so maybe an action item for someone to address that question.

Mo66love and mikebarb's exchange about staking rewards. Mo66love is asking about future rewards, and mikebarb clarifies that currently, it's staking rewards and taker fees. No direct action here unless the team needs to consider adding more rewards, but that's speculative.

Sunnybo666 asks for official customer service, and mikebarb provides a support ticket link. The action here is for the user
