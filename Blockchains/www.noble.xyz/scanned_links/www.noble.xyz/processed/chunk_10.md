Cosmos-based Noble first to launch custom stablecoin using cryptodollar infrastructure startup M^0

The Cosmos-based Noble blockchain is the first to launch a new dollar-denominated token, USDN, using decentralized stablecoin infrastructure provided by stablecoin upstart M^0, according to an announcement on Thursday. USDN will leverage $M as its âcore building blockâ to provide the broader Interchain ecosystem with âa credibly neutral digital dollar,â the company said in a statement. 

âThis collaboration not only advances Cosmos-native stablecoin adoption but sets a new precedent for stablecoin design by focusing on safety, programmability, and interoperability,â Noble CEO Jelena Djuric said. âWeâre excited to redefine what stablecoin infrastructure can achieve within decentralized finance.â

M^0 and Noble set sights on Tetherâs $136B empire

Programmable yield, seamless swaps and decentralized control are the hallmarks of a new stablecoin model.

Proud to support @noble_xyz team

What made me excited:

- Jelena's passion
- Simple and Cheap USDC bridge to Solana
- Paying fees with USDC
- Standard USDC on Osmosis (xyzUSDC doesn't look good lol)
