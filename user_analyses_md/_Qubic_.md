Putting this tweet in the context of intentions:
This tweet appears to be part of a broader effort to promote the Qubic blockchain platform. By thanking someone for inclusion, making bold claims about fast blockchains being infrastructure rather than hype, and highlighting specific technical features (T+0 settlement, AI compute, Web3 execution), the author is trying to position Qubic as a serious, innovative platform that solves real problems in the blockchain space. The tweet is concise but packs multiple selling points into a short message to generate interest among technically savvy users and investors.

Now I'll extract the 5 matching keywords/tags:
1. #Qubic (the blockchain platform being discussed)
2. #BlockchainInfrastructure (the main claim being made about fast blockchains)
3. #Web3 (referenced explicitly in the tweet)
4. #DecentralizedAI (specific application mentioned)
5. #TPlus0 (technical feature mentioned)

Additional keywords that could work but aren't quite as central:
- #CryptoPlatforms
- #BlockchainDevelopment
- #DistributedComputing
- #SmartContracts
- #Web3Execution

I'll go with the first five as they most directly represent the core themes of the tweet.
</think>

**1. Main topics/themes discussed:**
The tweet promotes Qubic blockchain platform, highlighting its technical capabilities including instant T+0 settlement, decentralized AI compute, and its role in merging Web3 with real-world execution. It emphasizes blockchain as foundational infrastructure rather than hype.

**2. Language style and tone:**
Technical, concise, and confident. Uses industry terminology (T+0, atomic settlement, decentralized compute) to appeal to blockchain and finance professionals. Grateful opening ("Thanks for including Qubic") frames the message as collaborative yet assertive in positioning the project.

**3. Evaluation of legitimacy:**
Tweet appears legitimate. Mentions specific technical features and a named project (Qubic) without exaggerated claims. References real financial/blockchain concepts (T+0 settlement, decentralized AI) but lacks supporting evidence or links to verifiable data, limiting deeper assessment of claims.

**4. Ecosystem/project advertised:**
**Qubic** blockchain ecosystem, marketed as a solution for instant settlement, AI-driven decentralized computation, and Web3 execution layer.

**5. Evaluation of the author's character:**
- **Personality traits:** Tech-focused, detail-oriented, and forward-thinking. Communicates value propositions clearly but with minimal elaboration.
- **Motivations:** Position Qubic as a serious blockchain infrastructure player, particularly in AI and financial settlement use cases.
- **Values:** Innovation, practical blockchain applications, decentralization, and integration with emerging tech (Web3, AI).
- **Emotional patterns:** Grateful (thanking inclusion), confident (claiming infrastructure status), and visionary (linking to AI/Web3).
- **Decision-making:** Strategic, prioritizing high-impact technical features to appeal to developers and institutional users.

**Contextualizing intentions:**  
The tweet fits into a broader pattern of positioning Qubic as a next-gen blockchain that solves latency and scalability issues, targeting both financial institutions (via T+0 settlement) and AI developers (via decentralized compute). The mention of @gverdian suggests this is part of an engagement strategy with influencers or partners in the crypto space.
