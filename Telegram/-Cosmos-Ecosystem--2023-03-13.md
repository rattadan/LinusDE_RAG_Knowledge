## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. First, I need to parse through the different messages.

Looking at the combot tweets, there are a few announcements. The first one is a birthday message to Keplr wallet, which is a key point. Then another tweet lists several tokens and their associated projects, like Osmosis, Comdex, Juno, Onomy, and OmniFlix. The user might be interested in knowing these projects are being highlighted, maybe for updates or engagement.

Next, there's a question from folorunshoBams asking about the reward for the current quest. The response from combot mentions a Crew3 weekly update with new quests offering a $3k prize fund from Maincard. That's a significant detail because it includes a reward amount and a call to action.

Another combot tweet talks about Lambda upgrading with a testnet coming, involving ATOM and LAMBDA tokens. Upgrades and testnets are important in blockchain ecosystems as they indicate development progress.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements without extra fluff. The user probably wants to quickly grasp the main announcements and rewards. Also, note the mentions of specific projects and their tags, as well as the links provided. But since the user wants it concise, maybe just mention the projects and the prize amount without listing all the handles. Wait, the original tweets include the handles and hashtags, which are part of the key points. Should I include them? The example response includes the token symbols and project names, so I should follow that.

Decisions here are the announcements made by Cosmos Ecosystem: Keplr's birthday, Lambda's testnet upgrade, new quests with rewards. The user's question about the reward is answered with the $3k prize fund. So the key points are the birthday, Lambda's testnet, and the Crew3 quests with the prize. Also, the tokens mentioned are ATOM, LAMBDA, OSMA, CMDX, JUNO, NOM, FLIX.

I need to structure this clearly, maybe bullet points or a numbered list. But the example uses bullet points. Let me check the example again. Yes, it lists each key point with emojis and brief descriptions. So I'll follow that style, ensuring each main announcement is a bullet point, include the reward info, and mention the involved projects and tokens.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. The text includes several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and a question from someone named folorunshoBams.

First, I'll go through each part of the text. The first tweet is a birthday message to Keplr wallet. So the main topic here is "Keplr Wallet Birthday". Then there's a list of tokens: $OSMO, $CMDX, $JUNO, $NOM, $FLIX. Those should be included as they are. Also, mentions of various projects like Osmosis, Comdex, JunoNetwork, OnomyProtocol, OmniFlixNetwork. So maybe each of those project names are topics.

Next, the user folorunshoBams asks about the reward for the current quest. The main topic here is "Current Quest Reward".

Another tweet mentions Lambda upgrading and Testnet coming. So "Lambda Upgrade" and "Testnet Announcement" could be topics. They also mention $ATOM and $LAMBDA as hashtags, so those tokens should be included.

Then there's a tweet about Crew3 weekly updates, new ecosystem projects quests, Maincard's prize fund, and giveaways. Topics here might be "Crew3 Weekly Updates", "New Ecosystem Quests", "Maincard Prize Fund", and "Giveaways".

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other key points. The tweets also include hashtags like #Testnet, #Crew3, #Giveaways, which are already covered. The tokens mentioned are $OSMO, $CMDX, $JUNO, $NOM, $FLIX, $ATOM, $LAMBDA. The projects mentioned are Osmosis, Comdex, JunoNetwork, OnomyProtocol, OmniFlixNetwork, Lambdaim, Maincard.

Wait, the user might want the topics to be more general rather than specific names. But the example they provided in the text includes specific projects and tokens, so probably should keep those as topics. Also, actions like "Follow to stay updated" and "Share to update" might be considered topics, but maybe the main focus is on the projects, events, and tokens. 

Putting it all together, the main topics seem to be:

- Keplr Wallet Birthday
- $OSMO
- $CMDX
- $J

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided several chat messages from the Cosmos Ecosystem and another user. I need to determine the sentiment of each as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, looking at the earliest message from combot at 05:30:58. It's a tweet about Crew3 weekly updates, new quests, a prize fund of $3k, and mentions giveaways. Words like "üöÄ", "ü§ë", "üéÅ", and phrases like "Don't miss the gifts" and "Learn and rank up" are positive. They're promoting something exciting with rewards, so definitely positive.

Next, the message at 05:33:38 talks about Lambda upgrading and a testnet coming. The use of "üöÄ" and "coming!" suggests excitement. Upgrades and new testnets are usually positive developments in tech projects, so this one is positive too.

Then there's a message from folorunshoBams asking about the reward for the current quest. It's a straightforward question without any emotional language. Since there's no positive or negative words here, this should be neutral.

The message at 13:24:14 includes a birthday wish to Keplr wallet with üéÇ and a list of followed projects. Birthday wishes are positive, and the emojis like ‚úÖ and üôå indicate approval. The mention of sharing and following to stay updated also shows engagement, so positive.

The next message at 13:36:41 is another birthday tweet with üéÇ and emojis. Happy Birthday is clearly positive, so that's another positive sentiment.

Lastly, the user wants the overall sentiment. Most messages are positive, one is neutral. So the overall is positive. I should list each with their time and sentiment, then the overall. Need to make sure I don't miss any. Also check if any negative cues, but they all seem positive or neutral. Yeah, looks good.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. First, I need to understand the structure of the text. It looks like a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, with some replies or mentions from others.

Starting with the first tweet from combot on March 13th at 13:36. It's a birthday message to Keplr wallet. No action items here, just a greeting. Next, the tweet at 13:24 mentions following and sharing for updates, along with some crypto tags. The emojis "‚úÖFollow to stay updated" and "üôå Share to update" seem like actions they want the audience to take. So that's follow and share.

Then there's a question from folorunshoBams asking about the current quest reward. The user might be looking for the answer in the next tweets. Looking at the combot tweet from 05:30:58, it mentions Crew3 weekly updates, new quests live, a prize fund from Maincard, and encourages participation. The action items here would be to participate in the quests, visit the questboard, and not miss the gifts. Also, the mention of ranking up suggests taking steps to learn and improve status.

Another tweet from combot at 05:33:38 talks about Lambda's testnet upgrade. The action item here is to check the provided link for information on the testnet update.

Now, compiling these points. The main actions are following and sharing the account for updates, participating in the Maincard quests with a prize fund, visiting the Crew3 questboard, checking Lambda's testnet upgrade link, and engaging in learning to rank up. The decisions or next steps would be the specific actions users need to take, like visiting URLs or joining quests. I should list each action item clearly, maybe categorize them if possible, and ensure all relevant details are included. Also, note the deadlines or time-sensitive aspects if any, but the text doesn't mention specific deadlines. Make sure to present the extracted items in a structured format, like bullet points, and mention the sources as tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. Avoid including the birthday message since it's not an action item. Check if the user's question was answered, which seems to be covered in the Crew3 quest tweet mentioning the prize fund. Alright, that
