## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 10

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

**Original Text:**

In general, these services have a fixed route or all
passengers share the same origin and destination (?, ch. 2). App-based dynamic transportation network companies (TNC), such as UBER and Lyft, have both introduced
pooled services in larger metropolitan areas. Upon ordering, customers receive an estimated arrival time at their
destination and a fixed fare quote. Depending on the likelhood of pooling passengers with each other, the offered fare
is significantly lower than for non-pooled options(??). Most TNCs argue, that their service aims at passengers that
previously would have used their private car, however, recent studies suggest, that public transport usage declines
due to growing TNC use. This is especially true for buses, where a six per cent decline was measured, but also for
light rail services (?). In Europe, TNCs only recently started pooling of services. Notably, public transport operators
themselves are more often starting to roll out TNC-like services.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**
The text chunk is describing the technical details related to demand responsive transportation (DRT) systems, specifically stop-based and door-to-door models.

1. **Stop-Based System:** The simulation model evaluates the operational costs and travel times of a DRT system with both stop-based and door-to-door modes.
2. **Door-to-Door System:** This option has lower operational costs but significantly shorter travel times compared to traditional public transport, making it potentially cheaper for passengers to use driverless vehicles.

**Connection to Surrounding Context:**
The chunk connects to the surrounding context by highlighting key points in a summary of a paper discussing the potential impact of fully automated DRT systems on traditional public transport operations. The text serves as background information for understanding the main topic, which is how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes.

**Requirements, Conditions, and Constraints:**
The current text chunk does not explicitly mention specific requirements or conditions that must be met for a system to be considered fully automated. However, it implies that future studies should consider various factors, such as the potential influence on mode choice and the impact of competing services from MaaS providers.

Overall, this section provides technical insights into demand responsive transportation systems, particularly in the context of stop-based and door-to-door models, which are essential for understanding how fully automated DRT systems might operate.
