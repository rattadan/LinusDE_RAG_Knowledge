I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!
