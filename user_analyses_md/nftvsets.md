Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed analysis of the given tweets, focusing on specific aspects. First, I need to understand the main topics and themes.

Next, the language style and tone. The user is using casual, enthusiastic language, with emojis and hashtags. The tone is positive and excited, especially with phrases like "yessss please!!" and mentions of big events like the release of rewards.
