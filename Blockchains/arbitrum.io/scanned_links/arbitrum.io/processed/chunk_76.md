law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Offchain Labs submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York, New York. The failure of Offchain Labs to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Offchain Labs, but Offchain Labs may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.

The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these Terms of Service, the words include and including, and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words without limitation. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.
