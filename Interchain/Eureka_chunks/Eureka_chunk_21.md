## Eureka - Chunk 21

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

The channel you want to use is available in the response in recommendations[0].asset.trace

How do I transfer tokens over my chosen channel before Skip Go API supports it? The easiest way to transfer tokens over a channel before official Skip Go API support is to use Keplr’s developer mode. To enable developer mode in the Keplr extension, open the hamburger menu, click on settings, then click advanced, then activate the toggle for “Developer Mode”. Once developer mode is active, at the bottom of the main page you should see “Advanced IBC Transfer”. Click on this then follow the instructions for inputting your token and desired channel ID. Why is this required? Warm starting the channels kicks off Skip’s intelligent routing suggestions for folks bridging to and from your chain. We choose routes between chains that ensure users are always receiving the most desirable version of their chosen token on their destination chain.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Processes:**

The current text chunk describes a technical process for transferring tokens over an inter-chain asset transfer protocol, specifically leveraging Keplr's developer mode to bypass Skip Go API support.

1. **Keplr Developer Mode:** The user must enable Keplr's developer mode in their extension settings.
2. **Advanced IBC Transfer:** Once enabled, the user can proceed with inputting their token and desired channel ID using the "Advanced IBC Transfer" feature.
3. **Skip's Intelligent Routing Suggestion:** Skip Go API will suggest intelligent routing routes for bridging to and from the chosen chain.

**Context:**

The text chunk is connected to the surrounding context by explaining potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically highlighting issues with Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast. This information is essential for developers and users who want to understand how to mitigate risks associated with cross-chain transfers.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

To use Keplr's developer mode, the user must:

* Have Keplr installed and enabled in their extension settings
* Be using a channel that supports developer mode (as mentioned in recommendations [0].asset.trace)
* Enable Keplr's developer mode through advanced settings

Additionally, Skip Go API support is required to bypass its limitations and leverage intelligent routing suggestions for bridging between chains.
