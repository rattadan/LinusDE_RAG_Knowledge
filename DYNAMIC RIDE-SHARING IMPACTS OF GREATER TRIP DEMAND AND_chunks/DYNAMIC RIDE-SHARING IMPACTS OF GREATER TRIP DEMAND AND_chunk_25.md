## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 25

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

0.25- and 0.5-mile PUDO Spacing Scenarios
RESULTS
Two sets of results are presented in this study as explained above. First, the effect of trip-end
density in conjunction with the different stop spacing was tested. Results regarding effects on
empty VMT, total and fleet VMT, delay, and other fleet metrics are presented and discussed. Second, the case with an artificially inflated mode share for SAVs is highlighted to draw
conclusions on preferential traveler impacts on fleet use and impact on the network. Effect of Density
Twelve scenarios were simulated in an attempt to isolate fleet operation effects that are of
interest. The base case for Bloomington consists of three simulations with varying trip densities
and without offering DRS. Base case results highlight the small share of person-trips for SAVs
and transit at about 8% and 4%, respectively, in auto-centric Bloomington.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text is explaining a technical analysis of the impact of stop spacing on shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) pickup and drop-off locations across different areas, specifically the city of Bloomington, Illinois.

1. **Technical details:** The section describes the methodology used to analyze the effect of trip-end density in conjunction with different stop spacing scenarios on empty Vehicle-to-Machine (VMT), total vehicle-to-machine (fleet VMT), delay, and other fleet metrics. Specifically, it mentions:

* Using a dataset from 2014 to 2020
* Two sets of results presented: one focusing on effects on empty VMT, total and fleet VMT, delay, and other fleet metrics
* Twelve scenarios simulated to isolate fleet operation effects

2. **Context connection:** The chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing more information about the study's objectives and methodology:

* The text mentions that the references cover various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies
* It highlights key authors, including K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.
* The text also emphasizes the importance of capturing recent developments in the field (spanning from 2014 to 2020) and mentions specific studies that have been extracted for further analysis.

3. **Requirements, conditions, or constraints:** The text does not explicitly mention any requirements, conditions, or constraints beyond providing additional details on particular studies and analyzing trends across papers. However, it is worth noting that the study appears to be focused on exploring potential impacts of stop spacing on SAVs in a specific urban setting (Bloomington, Illinois), which may have implications for transportation systems and infrastructure planning.

In summary, this section provides technical details about the methodology used to analyze the effect of trip-end density on empty VMT, total fleet VMT, delay, and other metrics for shared autonomous vehicles. The context connection builds upon the surrounding discussion of shared autonomous vehicle research and highlights key authors and recent developments in the field.
