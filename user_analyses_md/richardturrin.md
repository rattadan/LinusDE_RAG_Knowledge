Let me check if the user wants me to use the hashtags they already included in the tweet or create new ones.

The ones I've listed above are relevant to the content and would be useful for postprocessing.

Wait, I notice the instruction says "generate and append 5 matching keywords/tags for better postprocessing" after the main analysis. So I should include these at the end.
