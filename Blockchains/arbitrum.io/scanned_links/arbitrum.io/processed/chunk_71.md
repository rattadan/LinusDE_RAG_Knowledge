Offchain Labs is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customers satisfaction by emailing customer support at info@offchainlabs.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (Notice). The Notice to Offchain Labs should be sent to 252 Nassau Street, Floor 2, Princeton, New Jersey 08542 (Notice Address). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Offchain Labs and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Offchain Labs may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Offchain Labs or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Offchain Labs is entitled.

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations (AAA) rules and procedures, including the AAAs Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the AAA Rules), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAAs consumer arbitration page,https://www.adr.org/consumer.
