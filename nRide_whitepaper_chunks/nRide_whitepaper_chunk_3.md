This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

Additionally,
nRide solves the problem of isolated user bases by providing a standardized way for ride-hailing applications to connect with each other and access a larger user base, fostering a more open and competitive marketplace. nRide consists in an open-source software stack that includes a messaging protocol, an escrow mechanism,
and a driver registry. The messaging protocol enables secure direct communication between riders and drivers, ensuring that all information shared between the two parties is kept private and secure. The escrow
mechanism ensures that both riders and drivers fulfill their commitments by holding funds in escrow until
the pickup is completed or cancelled. The driver registry is a shared database of driversâ€™ information used
by all nRide-compatible applications.
