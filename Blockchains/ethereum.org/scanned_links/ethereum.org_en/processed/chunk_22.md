## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for using Ethereum wallets, covering key functions like receiving, sending, and connecting to projects, while emphasizing security practices and address management.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Ethereum Address**: A unique identifier for an account, starting with "0x", used to receive and send cryptocurrency.  
- **Public Address**: Shared with others to initiate transactions; must be copied or scanned (QR code).  
- **Private Key**: Secret password for access to an account; should never be shared.  
- **Wallet Dashboard**: Displays balance, send/receive buttons, and transaction status.  
- **Transaction Status**: Tracks the progress of sending or receiving funds (e.g., "Pending," "Success").  
- **Security Best Practices**: Avoid manual entry of addresses; use QR codes or wallet apps for safety.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Send/Receive Process**:  
  - To send ETH: Share the public address, confirm the recipient, and use the wallet’s send button.  
  - To receive: Copy the public address, paste it into a compatible app (e.g., MetaMask), or scan a QR code.  
- **Address Management**:  
  - Each account has a unique address; shares are safe but must be kept secure.  
- **Transaction Cancellation**:  
  - Users can cancel or return transactions if they detect errors (e.g., incorrect addresses).  
- **Cross-Chain Considerations**:  
  - Addresses are specific to Ethereum; transferring funds to other blockchains requires separate accounts or bridges.  

### Related Topics  
- **"How to create an Ethereum account"**: Linked to the document’s introduction, guiding users to set up their first wallet.  
- **"Connecting to projects"**: Referred to in the "Connecting to projects" section, emphasizing compatibility across apps.  
- **"Frequently asked questions"**: Highlights user concerns about address ownership, device compatibility, and transaction status.

Learn how to operate all the basic functions of a wallet. If you dont have one yet, check out ourHow to create an Ethereum account.

You should see a dashboard that will likely show your balance and contain buttons to send and receive tokens.

Do you want to receive crypto into your wallet?

Each Ethereum account has its own receiving address which is a unique sequence of numbers and letters. The address functions like a bank account number. Ethereum addresses will always start with 0x. You can share this address with anyone: it is safe to do so.

Your address is like your home address: you need to tell people what it is so they can find you. It is safe to do this, because you can still lock your front door with another key only you control so that no-one can get in, even if they know where you live.

You need to provide whoever wants to send you money with your public address. Many wallet apps let you copy your address or show a QR code to scan for easier usage. Avoid typing any Ethereum address manually. This can easily lead to clerical errors and lost funds.

Different apps may vary or use different language, but they should take you through a similar process if you are trying to transfer funds.

Would you like to send ETH to another wallet?
