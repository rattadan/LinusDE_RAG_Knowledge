Contextualizing these tweets with what they suggest about the author's intentions:
The author appears to be intentionally building an engaged community around their phygital collectibles platform.

The giveaways serve as engagement drivers and likely help increase visibility for their platform. Their emphasis on being "100% bootstrapped" and "collectors building for collectors" suggests they want to position themselves as authentic and community-driven rather than a corporate or investor-backed project.
