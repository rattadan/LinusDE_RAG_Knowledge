### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Solana ecosystem**: A decentralized network enabling high throughput and low fees.  
- **Stablecoins and memecoins**: Tokens used for transactions, with memecoins (e.g., Doge, Shiba Inu) integrated into the ecosystem.  
- **Block times**: Solana operates with 400ms block times, ensuring fast transaction processing.  
- **Transaction fees**: Fees under $0.0025, making it cost-effective for developers and users.  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators ensure security and reduce environmental impact.  
- **Censorship-resistant network**: Independent nodes validate data, ensuring decentralization.  
- **FEDXX fund**: A Solana-based fund accessible via Franklin Templeton’s BENJI platform.  
- **DEX transactions**: 81% of DEX transactions originate from Solana, highlighting its ecosystem dominance.

- **Block time**: 400ms for transaction finality, enabling high throughput.  
- **FEDXX fund**: Accessible via Franklin Templeton’s BENJI platform, allowing users to stake or trade tokens.  
- **Ecosystem integration**: The shopping event (e.g., Onchain Holiday) allows users to spend stablecoins/memecoins for merchandise, leveraging Solana’s infrastructure.  
- **Environmental impact**: PoS consensus minimizes energy consumption compared to traditional blockchains.
