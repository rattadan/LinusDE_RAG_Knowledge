## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on decisions and important info.

Starting from the top, osmosis_statbot mentions visiting the support site. Not too important for key decisions. Then WhoIsAbk just says "What's crackin" which is casual. 

osmosis_news has a big one: Proposal 919 passed, Osmosis integrating with Babylon Genesis to become a Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN). That's a major decision. They'll use Bitcoin's security and be a trading venue for Babylon assets. Future upgrade needed.

Me372848228924729387 says "Don't ask yourself question, Just buy" ‚Äì probably advice or a call to action, but not a decision. Norrisherr's "He nailed it" is a reaction, maybe not key.

osmogovbot shares another post by JohnnyWyles about expanding the Supercharged Quote Asset list via Proposal 819. They're adding more assets to the permission list, but it doesn't override the plan to remove the list eventually. Another important decision.

Hleb_albau and norrisherr have some back-and-forth. Hleb mentions "Bitmosis" as a joke, saying Osmosis is done and founders left. Davidjgoosey clarifies Bitmosis is just a fun name for Bitcoin initiatives. So that's a clarification but not a decision.

Link_vector and Brazer11 discuss meeting founders of projects like Sifchain and Comdex, but these are past events and not decisions. Sandro20212 announces a new $NIL Perp Market on Mars, which is a new feature launch ‚Äì key point.

Typttt and norrisherr have a conversation about charities being thieves, but that's opinionated and not a decision. DarkBoy1972 accuses Comdex of stealing money, which is a user complaint, not Osmosis' decision.

Ips14 asks if Polaris Beta is safe ‚Äì a question without a decision. JohnnyWyles and khuwarzmi discuss DefiLlama data issues, inflation rate, staking APY, and fee burning. The burning of 50% of taker fees and Protorev revenue is important. They mention a total burn of

First, I'll go through each message to identify the key subjects. The first message from osmosis_statbot is about visiting the support site, so the topic here is Support Site. Then, WhoIsAbk just says "What's crackin," which is a greeting, so maybe not a main topic.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different users on a platform related to Osmosis, which seems to be a blockchain project. The task is to determine the overall sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with the earliest ones. The first message from osmosis_statbot is a link to support, which is neutral. Then WhoIsAbk says "What's crackin" ‚Äì that's casual and neutral. The osmosis_news message about becoming a Bitcoin Secured Network via integration with Babylon Genesis looks positive because it's announcing a new initiative and upgrade. The user Me372848228924729387 says "Dont ask urself question, Just buy" ‚Äì that's a strong positive sentiment, urging action. 

Next, norrisherr's "He nailed it" is positive, agreeing with something. Then osmogovbot's message about expanding quote assets is neutral or slightly positive as it's informational. hleb_albau's "Why you so serious..." is neutral, maybe teasing. Another norrisherr message "Why fudding like this..." uses "fudding" (probably FUD, fear, uncertainty, doubt) which is negative. Then "Wth you saying?" is also negative, showing frustration.

davidjgoosey and kychuli are discussing "Bitmosis" as a fun name, which seems positive. But hleb_albau's message about founders "rugged chain and run" ‚Äì "rugged" might be a typo for "rug pull" (a scam in crypto), which is definitely negative. 

link_vector mentions Osmosis has a good reputation but with typical crypto investor issues, so that's neutral leaning positive. However, the next messages from link_vector and Brazer11 discuss meeting founders and rug pulls, which are negative references. Sandro20212 announces a new market launch with emojis, which is positive. 

The typttt and norrisherr messages from 2025-04-14T12:09:45 to 12:06:56 are all negative: "nuke this world", "thieves everywhere", calling charities legal thieves, and accusing others of greed. 

Then DarkBoy

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any that indicate something needs to be done, a decision was made, or a next step is mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot with a link to support. That's more of an informational message, not an action item. Then WhoIsAbk just says "What's crackin" which is a greeting, so nothing there. 

The osmosis_news message mentions that governance proposal 919 has passed, committing Osmosis to become a Bitcoin Secured Network via Babylon Genesis integration. This is a decision because it states that the change will be implemented in a future upgrade. So that's a key point to note.

Next, Me372848228924729387 says "Dont ask urself question, Just buy" ‚Äì that's a recommendation but not a formal action item. Norrisherr's comments like "He nailed it" are opinions, not actions. 

Then osmogovbot shares a post from @JohnnyWyles about expanding the Supercharged Quote Asset list as per Proposal 819. The message mentions that the removal of permissioned quote assets is pending implementation. This indicates a next step since it's awaiting implementation. Also, the proposal to add assets to the permission list is another action item related to future upgrades.

Looking at the other messages, there are discussions about staking issues in Comdex, but those are user complaints without any official action mentioned. Khuwarzmi provides links to fee burn data, and there's a mention of checking Protorev and taker fees, but again, no specific action item from the team. 

The user_7466133751 asks about the inflation rate and staking APY. JohnnyWyles87 responds to a question about Defillama data, saying he'll look into it today. That's an action item because he's committing to investigate a data connection issue. 

Another part from Khuwarzmi mentions that 50% of taker fees are burned monthly and Protorev earnings are burned daily. This is a decision as it's a policy that's already in place.
