## Chunk 68

**Original Text:**

The car trip share in the Berlin area
decreases by approx. 12% (minimum DRT fee: 3 EUR), and PT, bicycle, walk and DRT trip shares increase. 1 The number of DRT trips is limited by the fleet size which is fixed to 10,000 vehicles. Additional simulation experiments which are carried out
to investigate the impact of the fleet size indicate that a fleet of 20,000 vehicles results in approx. 1 million DRT trips, and an even larger fleet size
of 100,000 vehicles motivates additional users to switch to the DRT mode, resulting in a total of approx.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Let's break down the information provided:

* The car trip share decreases by approximately 12% (minimum DRT fee: 3 EUR).
* PT (Public Transportation) and other trip shares increase.
* A fleet size of 10,000 vehicles is fixed to limit DRT trips.

We can start analyzing the impact of increasing the fleet size on DRT usage:

1. With a smaller fleet size of 10,000 vehicles, approximately 1 million DRT trips are achieved (as mentioned).
2. An even larger fleet size of 20,000 vehicles motivates additional users to switch to the DRT mode.

To investigate further, let's consider the potential impact of increasing the fleet size on total user numbers:

* With a fleet size of 10,000 vehicles, approximately 1 million DRT trips are achieved.
* As more users switch to the DRT mode with an increased fleet size (e.g., 20,000 vehicles), additional users may join this mode.

Let's assume that for every additional 1,000-2,000 new users who switch from private car ownership to using the DRT mode, a certain percentage of existing users will remain in their current transportation habits. This could be due to various factors such as convenience, cost-effectiveness, or lack of awareness about alternative modes.

Using this assumption, let's make some hypothetical calculations:

* If 10,000-20,000 new users switch from private car ownership to using the DRT mode, the total number of users in the Berlin area may increase by an additional 100,000-200,000 (1 million - 500,000 = 500,000 or 1.5 million - 800,000).

Assuming that each new user brings a certain percentage of existing users with them, let's estimate the percentage increase:

* A conservative estimate could be that for every 1,000-2,000 new users who switch to DRT, approximately 50-100% of their current network (existing users) remains in their current transportation habits. This is purely speculative and based on rough estimates.
* With a total increase of 100,000-200,000 new users, the estimated number of existing users could be around 900,000-1,200,000.

Now, let's consider the minimum DRT fee: 3 EUR per trip. If we assume that this fee remains constant, and users switch to the DRT mode at a similar rate as with private car ownership (10% increase), we can estimate the additional revenue generated by increased user numbers:

* With an estimated increase of 100,000-200,000 new users (900,000-1,200,000 existing users) bringing in 3 EUR per trip, the total additional revenue from DRT trips could be around 300,000 to 720,000 euros.

Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and actual numbers may vary. However, it gives you an idea of how increasing the fleet size can impact total user numbers and revenue from DRT trips.
