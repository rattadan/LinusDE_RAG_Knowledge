**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're discussing the growth of shared transportation services in the public transit sector, particularly how apps like Uber and Lyft have expanded beyond traditional on-demand ride-sharing to include other forms of mobility for multiple passengers.

The passage mentions four specific companies: UBER, BerlKönig, CleverShuttle, and MOIA. These companies are part of a larger trend where many others in the industry have also started offering these services.

Uber is already a well-known name in this space, but Lyft has been gaining ground in recent years, especially in certain markets. Other companies like BerlKönig and CleverShuttle are also entering this market.

The key point here is that these shared transportation services often pool riders together to share the cost of a ride or provide more efficient use of resources by reducing the need for individual drivers.

The passage highlights how these services can be categorized into two main types: demand transit (DRT) and ride-hailing. Demand transit involves sharing rides among multiple passengers, while ride-hailing focuses on providing on-demand transportation for one person at a time.

Overall, this trend suggests that the traditional public transportation model is evolving to accommodate more people's needs, such as shared mobility services that can reduce congestion and lower costs.
