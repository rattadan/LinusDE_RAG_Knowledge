## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 9

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

**Original Text:**

In this paper, we are using a simulation based approach
to evaluate the service quality of a MaaS system for the city of Cottbus, Germany. This includes both a comparison
of different operational forms of DRT and a comparison with the service quality and costs of conventional public
transport. In the remainder of the paper firstly an overview of similar research is provided. This is followed by the methodology used and a results section. The paper concludes with a warp-up and outlook on possible further research. 2. Related work
Demand responsive transport, as a form of ridesharing systems, where multiple passengers share a car or van, is
nothing new. Jitney and shared taxi services were a popular means of transport in US cities at the turn of the 20th
century, before they were widely banned from operating. However, in many countries, these services continue to
operate and are often the pre-dominant form of public transport.

This specific text chunk is explaining the technical details and parameters used in a simulation-based approach for evaluating the service quality of a Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Technical Details**: The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems, which are designed to optimize transportation efficiency.
2. **Parameters and Processes**:
	* The simulation evaluates operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization for different scenarios.
3. **Contextual Connection**: This chunk connects to the surrounding context by setting the stage for the rest of the paper, which provides an overview of similar research in the field of Demand Responsive Transport.

The specific technical details mentioned are:

* Stop-based system: Lower operational costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
* Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.
* Operational Cost Analysis:
	+ Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
	+ Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.

The context is that this paper discusses the potential impact of fully automated DRT systems on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. The simulation approach aims to evaluate the service quality and costs of these systems.
