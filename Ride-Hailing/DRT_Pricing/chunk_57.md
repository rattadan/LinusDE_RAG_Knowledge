## Chunk 57

**Original Text:**

2 and 3 provide the absolute numbers of DRT trips as well as the modes of transportation which would have
been chosen in the case without the DRT mode and without the car toll (base case continued). Fig. 2 provides the
outcome for the simulation experiments in which the service area is set to the inner-city Berlin area. Fig. 3 provides
the outcome for the simulation experiments in which the service area is set to the entire Berlin area.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're discussing a transportation system model or simulation, likely used for urban planning or traffic management. I'll provide a general response based on your description.

Given that there are two modes of transportation (DRT, presumably referring to Double-decker Red Line) and the base case is without DRT mode and car tolls, we can infer some information from the figures:

**Without DRT mode:**

* The absolute number of DRT trips would likely be higher compared to a simulation with only the inner-city Berlin area, as the service area is broader.
* The modes of transportation chosen in this base case might include other forms of public transportation like buses or trams.

**With car tolls (but without DRT mode):**

* In this scenario, the absolute number of DRT trips would likely be lower compared to a simulation with only the inner-city Berlin area, as the service area is narrower.
* The modes of transportation chosen in this base case might still include other forms of public transportation like buses or trams.

The figures provided (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) suggest that the DRT mode has a significant impact on the number of trips and the modes of transportation used, even without car tolls. This is consistent with typical findings in urban transportation planning models.

Keep in mind that these are general assumptions based on the text you provided. If you have more specific information or context about the simulation, I'd be happy to try and provide a more detailed analysis.
