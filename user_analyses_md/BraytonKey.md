Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided two tweets and wants a summary with specific points. First, I need to break down each part.

Starting with the main topics. The first tweet talks about Bitcoin companies on Nasdaq, BoostVC's investment in Fold App, and the founders' celebration. The second mentions AI as a discovery engine, breakthroughs, and Deep Tech founders. So the main themes are crypto, AI, startup success, and investment.
