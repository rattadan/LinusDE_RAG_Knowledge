**Original Text:**

Therefore, we analysed different continuous
CDFs to determine their fit with the stop time data. In line with our regression models, we
examined separate CDFs for boarding and alighting. This allowed us to assess the probability of specific stop times and gain insight into their range. Among the CDFs tested were
commonly used distributions such as log-logistic, Weibull, and exponential distributions. To identify the best-fitting CDF for our empirical data, we employed the pairwise KS
test. Results
Descriptive statistics
Our on-site observations led to 226 reported PUDO activities. After pre-processing, which
involved removing five no-shows (2%) and five outliers (2%), 216 stop times remained
suitable for further analysis, representing 96% of all observations. The histogram in Figure 3 illustrates the frequency distribution of the measured stop
times. The mean stop time is 45.85 s, with a STD of 61.91 s.
