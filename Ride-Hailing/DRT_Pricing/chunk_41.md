## Chunk 41

**Original Text:**

That is, transport users do
not interact with each other or users of other modes. For walk and bicycle, the travel times are computed based on
a mode-specific speed (walk: 4 km/h; bicycle: 12 km/h) and a trip distance resulting from the beeline distance and a
beeline distance factor (walk: 1.5; bicycle: 1.4). For ride, the travel time is computed based on the least cost network
route taking into consideration the congested car travel time. Choice dimensions. All transport users are allowed to change their transport routes, departure times and modes of
transportation.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that you're discussing the transportation system or infrastructure in some way. Could you please provide more context or clarify what specific aspect of transportation you would like me to assist with? I'll do my best to provide a helpful response.

However, based on your text, it seems like you're describing how users interact with different modes of transportation (walk, bicycle, and ride) within the same system. If that's correct, here are some potential questions or areas where I can offer assistance:

* How do different modes of transportation calculate travel times?
* What factors influence the choice of mode of transportation for a particular trip (e.g., mode-specific speed, congested car travel time)?
* Can users change their transport routes or departure times within the system?
* Are there any specific features or functionalities that allow users to interact with other modes of transportation?

Please let me know if you'd like more information or guidance on these topics.
