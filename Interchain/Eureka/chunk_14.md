Token & Route Support Requirements
This document describes the steps you must complete for the Skip Go API to begin providing new routes for users to transfer a token over to various remote chains using IBC. ​
Background
New tokens often want Skip Go API to add support for transferring their token to other chains because the API powers cross-chain swaps + transfers in all the major cosmos wallets (Leap, Keplr, IBC Wallet, Metamask Snap) and cross-chain DEX aggregation for many popular defi aggregator and dapp frontends (e.g. Stargaze). As a result, being added to the Skip Go API instantly offers distribution across the interchain for a new token
This document covers the basic requirements tokens must satisfy and steps their contributors must complete in order for Skip Go API to support transferring them throughout the interchain
Guide assumes using IBC for interop

This guide assumes you’re using IBC to transfer your token between chains. The Skip Go API supports other bridges and interop protocols in addition to IBC, including Hyperlane, CCTP, and Axelar.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided text, here are the Token & Route Support Requirements for the Skip Go API:

To begin providing new routes for users to transfer a token over to various remote chains using Interoperable Blockchain Crossing (IBC), the following requirements must be satisfied by tokens and contributors:

1. Tokens must have the capability to support cross-chain transfers.
2. Contributors must complete the steps outlined in this guide to ensure their tokens can be added to the Skip Go API for interchain routing.

These requirements cover the basic steps required for tokens and contributors to enable transfer of their token across multiple chains using IBC, as well as other interoperability protocols such as Hyperlane, CCTP, and Axelar.
