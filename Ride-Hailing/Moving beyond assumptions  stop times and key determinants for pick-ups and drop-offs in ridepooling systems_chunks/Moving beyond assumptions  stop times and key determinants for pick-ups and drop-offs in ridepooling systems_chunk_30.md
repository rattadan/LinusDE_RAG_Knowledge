**Original Text:**

Regarding
dwell movements, simultaneous boarding and alighting occurred in only four PUDO events
(1.9%). That implies that most multi-person stops involved groups travelling together rather
than individuals performing separate boarding and alighting actions. Analyzing stop times
based on dwell movement types reveals that boarding stops require significantly more
time than alighting stops. The median stop time for boarding was 29.5 s, higher than the
overall median of 21.0 s, while the median stop time for alighting was determined to be
18.0 s. Accordingly, pick-ups require approximately 64% more time than drop-offs. Stop
time for pick-up events also includes waiting for passengers if they have not reached the
PUDO location on time. Our data reveals 18 such cases, representing 8% of all observed
stop events. Most PUDO events involved individual travelers, with 158 stops (73.1%) featuring only a
single person. These stops have a mean stop time of 41.5 s and a median of 20.0 s.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of the text chunk is explaining and analyzing dwell movement times in ride-pooling services, specifically focusing on simultaneous boarding and alighting events.

**Technical details:**

* The analysis uses dwell movements to measure the time spent at each location before pick-up or drop-off.
* Dwell movement types are classified as boarding (PUDO events) or alighting (drop-offs).
* The median stop times for boarding and alighting are calculated, showing that boarding stops require significantly more time than alighting stops.

**Connection to surrounding context:**

This chunk is connected to the broader discussion of ride-pooling services in urban transport systems, specifically focusing on operational aspects. The analysis is relevant to researchers studying shared mobility solutions and their impact on traffic congestion and carbon emissions.

**Specific requirements or conditions:**

* None mentioned in this specific section.
* However, the context assumes a familiarity with ride-pooling services, urban transport systems, and simulation tools like MATSim, which are mentioned throughout the reference list.

Overall, this chunk provides valuable technical details about dwell movement times in ride-pooling services, highlighting the importance of understanding these metrics to optimize ride-pooling strategies.
