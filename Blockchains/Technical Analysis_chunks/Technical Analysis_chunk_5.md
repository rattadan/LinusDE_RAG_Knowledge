**Original Text:**

For instance, if you notice the price is continually trending downward, but the MACD line starts moving upward during this decline, it can signal that the ongoing downward trend may be coming to an end. This could be an indication of a potential trend reversal, presenting a trading opportunity. Top 5 most used indicators MACD divergence
