## Source Context
*From: https://www.base.org/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses Cat Town, a blockchain game built on the Base platform, which combines gaming with DeFi by creating a sustainable in-game economy, AI-driven gameplay, and token-based interactions.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Sustainable Tokenomics**: Token supply is managed to ensure long-term value and ecological stability.  
- **Autonomous In-Game Economy**: Game activities (e.g., fishing, gacha, quests) self-regulate through rewards, burning, and reinvestment.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated rules for game mechanics, NFTs, and token transactions.  
- **AI Agents**: Non-player characters (NPCs) that interact with players and manage game economies.  
- **NFTs**: Unique in-game items (e.g., cats, land, artifacts) that drive economic activity.  
- **Verifiable Randomness**: Fair gameplay mechanisms for random events (e.g., loot drops, tournaments).  
- **DeFi Integration**: Combines gaming with decentralized finance features (e.g., token rewards, staking).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Token System**: Players earn **KIBBLE** (the game’s utility token) through gameplay, trading, and in-game activities.  
- **Economy Balancing**: Rewards, burning, and reinvestment mechanisms ensure the economy remains sustainable.  
- **Game Features**:  
  - **Fishing Tournaments**: Competitive events with random outcomes.  
  - **Gacha Collections**: NFT-based loot drops.  
  - **Quests**: Player-driven tasks that contribute to the town’s economy.  
- **Technical Tools**:  
  - **Smart Contracts**: For game rules, NFT issuance, and token transactions.  
  - **AI Agents**: For NPC behavior and economy management.  
  - **Verifiable Randomness**: Ensures fairness in random events (e.g., loot drops).  

### Related Topics

h3: What advice do you have to other builders?

h3: "Take risks. Push the limits when designing smart contractsdon't just follow what's been done before. The best innovations come from experimenting. Don't raise funds too early. Too much money too soon can be just as bad as not enough. Make sure you have product-market fit before locking yourself into investor expectations."

h3: Tell us a little about the app you are building on Base?

h3: "Cat Town is a cozy onchain life sim game where cats live, trade, and build a thriving community together. We're building on Base with sustainable tokenomics and an autonomous in-game economy, Cat Town creates an experience that combines traditional gaming with DeFi. Players can participate in many onchain games including fishing tournaments, gacha collections, and quests, all while earning KIBBLE - the game's utility token. Each activity contributes to the town's economy through a balanced system of rewards, burning mechanisms, and reinvestment into the ecosystem to return value to loyal players. Utilizing smart contracts, AI agents, NFTs and verifiable randomness for fair gameplay, Cat Town offers a long-term commitment to sustainability."
