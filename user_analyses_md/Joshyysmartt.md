Putting some tweets in the context of his intentions:
The repeated mentions of using Infinex and the detailed descriptions of moving funds between chains suggest that the author wants to showcase their crypto activities as a way to inform or influence others. The tweet about "succinct longs finally in profit after 69 days" indicates they're sharing their investment journey, including the time it took to see returns, which could be meant to encourage patience in followers or demonstrate their own expertise.

The tweet about "please stop taking screenshots of Ethereum" seems to be a commentary on the crypto community's behavior, possibly suggesting that people are focusing too much on Ethereum when other opportunities exist. This aligns with their overall pattern of promoting alternative platforms and approaches.

The detailed descriptions of using various dApps and platforms (like OctoSwapDex, TreehouseFi, and Caldera) suggest the author wants to educate others on how to use these tools while also subtly promoting them through personal experience.

The tweet about "I can't be using MetaMask in 2025" shows the author's preference for newer tools and their desire to position themselves as someone who's ahead of the curve technologically, which could be intended to build credibility with their audience.

The tweet about "Kaito is the biggest thing that has happened to crypto this cycle" positions the author as someone who's identifying what they see as major trends, which could be meant to establish themselves as a thought leader in the space.

Overall, the author seems to be positioning themselves as a knowledgeable crypto enthusiast who's actively experimenting with new platforms and sharing their experiences, which could serve both educational and promotional purposes depending on the content.
