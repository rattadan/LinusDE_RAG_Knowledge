## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 24

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Table 1 Input Values Simulated as Separate Future Scenarios
Variable
Person-Trip Density Levels Simulated
Fleet Size
Response Time Threshold
Maximum Allowable Absolute Delay
Maximum Allowable Percentage Delay
Maximum Trip Directionality for Pooling
Pickup/Dropoff Location Spacings (ds)

Values
1x, 5x & 25x all person-trips
About 70 person-trips per SAV per day
10 min
5 min
25% of direct travel time
10 degrees
0 mi, 0.25 mi & 0.5 mi

Figure 1 shows the Bloomington region with all locations available as origins and destinations,
and the two sets of stops used in this analysis. It is clear that the density even in the base demand
case is likely to be high, and given that this region is only 74 sq. mi large, the fleet metrics for
SAVs in this study are expected to be higher than observed in literature.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details of a dataset or simulation used in an analysis related to shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The context builds upon a previous reference list discussing various aspects of SAVs, including their performance and impacts on urban transportation systems.

The technical details described are:

1. Variable names: `Fleet Size`, `Response Time Threshold`, `Maximum Allowable Absolute Delay`, `Maximum Allowable Percentage Delay`, and `Maximum Trip Directionality for Pooling`.
2. Parameter values:
	* `Person-Trip Density Levels`: 1x, 5x, and 25x.
	* `Base Demand Case`: `About 70 person-trips per SAV per day`.
	* `Response Time Threshold`: `10 min`, `5 min`, and `10 degrees` (indicating different time thresholds for response times).
	* `Maximum Allowable Absolute Delay`: `25% of direct travel time`.
	* `Maximum Allowable Percentage Delay`: `10%`.
3. Specific metrics:
	* The figure 1 shows the Bloomington region with various locations available as origins and destinations, demonstrating high density even in the base demand case.

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing technical details about a dataset used in an analysis related to SAVs.
2. Building upon previous information discussed in the reference list, which highlights potential impacts of SAVs on urban transportation systems.
3. Establishing specific parameters and metrics that are relevant to understanding the performance of SAVs.

Specific requirements or conditions mentioned include:

1. The need for specific information extracted from the table 1 input values (e.g., extracting details about person-trip density levels).
2. The ability to analyze trends across papers covered in the reference list.
3. A request for additional information or clarification regarding certain studies within the reference list.
