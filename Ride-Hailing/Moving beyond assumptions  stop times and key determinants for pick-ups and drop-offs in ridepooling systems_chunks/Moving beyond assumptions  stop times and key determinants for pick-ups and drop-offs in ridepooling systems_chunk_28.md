The distribution of stop times
shows a right-skewed pattern and is not normally distributed, as confirmed by the onesample KS test (p < 0.001). The median stop time is 21 s. Notably, the 75th percentile of the
stop time with 35.25 s is lower than the mean, further indicating the right-skewed nature of
the distribution. The data reveals a broad range of stop times, with a minimum stop time of
10 s and a maximum of 337 s, while 90% of all stops lasted less than 112.5 s. TRANSPORTMETRICA A: TRANSPORT SCIENCE

Figure 3. Distribution of measured stop times including mean, median, and the range between the 25th
and 75th percentile

We explored potential disparities in stop times across three distinct service areas. The
median stop time is consistent for all of them (21 s). Given that all areas share a similar suburban and rural character, it can be inferred that there is no significant difference in stop
times between these service areas.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**
The provided text chunk describes the distribution of stop times using statistical methods from the TRANSPORTMETRICA A: TRANSPORT SCIENCE dataset.

- **KS Test:** The onesample KS test is used to confirm that the distribution of stop times is not normally distributed, with a p-value (p < 0.001) indicating a statistically significant difference.
  
- **Statistical Tests and Methods:**
  - The median stop time is calculated as 21 seconds.
  - The range between the 25th and 75th percentile (Q3-Q1) is estimated to be around 112.5 seconds.

**Context Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**
This chunk provides a technical analysis of the distribution of stop times in three distinct service areas, exploring potential disparities across these areas. It builds upon the surrounding context by:

- Providing statistical evidence for the normality assumption (KS test) that stops are not normally distributed.
- Demonstrating an average stop time of 21 seconds and its median value as 112.5 seconds.

This analysis sets a foundation for understanding the operational aspects of ride-pooling services, particularly in addressing issues like travel times, disparities in service areas, and the integration of technology into urban transport systems.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

- The data used to analyze stop times is from the TRANSPORTMETRICA A: TRANSPORT SCIENCE dataset.
- The study aims to explore potential disparities across three distinct service areas (suburban, rural, and suburban-rural).
- The data is intended for researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals interested in understanding shared mobility solutions in urban contexts.
