For the legitimacy evaluation, the tweet is from an account that's likely focused on urban planning or public health. The use of a hashtag related to a global event (Global Road Safety Week) adds credibility. The image URL is there, but the link is broken, which might be a red flag, but the main message is clear and relevant.
