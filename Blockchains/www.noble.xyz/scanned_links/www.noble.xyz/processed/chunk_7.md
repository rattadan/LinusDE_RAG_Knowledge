### Document Overview  
The content outlines Noble.xyz's collaboration with M^0 to launch USDN, a Cosmos-based stablecoin, leveraging decentralized infrastructure to expand interoperability and DeFi adoption, while highlighting financial milestones and partnerships.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Cosmos-based blockchain**: A decentralized network for interchain communication and asset transfer.  
- **Stablecoin infrastructure**: M^0’s $M-backed USDN token for interoperability and programmable yield.  
- **Interchain ecosystem (IBC)**: Protocol enabling cross-chain transactions and asset movement.  
- **Programmable yield**: Dynamic financial mechanisms for stablecoins (e.g., liquidity pools, swaps).  
- **Interoperability**: Seamless cross-chain transfers (e.g., USDC to Cosmos via CCTP).  
- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Integration of stablecoins into decentralized financial systems.  

### Implementation Details  
- **USDN Token**: A Cosmos-based stablecoin using $M as its core building block, designed for neutrality and scalability.  
- **CCTP (Cosmos Chain Token Transfer Protocol)**: Enables fast, low-cost USDC deposits from Circle to Cosmos.  
- **Volume Metrics**: Noble surpassed Polygon, Avalanche, and others in USDC issuance, achieving 5B+ volume.  
- **Series A Funding**: $15M raised by Noble.xyz, led by Paradigm, emphasizing DeFi and interchain growth.  
- **Technical Features**: Programmable yield, seamless swaps, and decentralized control for stablecoin operations.  

### Related Topics  
- **Cosmos Interchain Architecture**: Connection to broader DeFi and IBC ecosystem developments.  
- **Stablecoin Infrastructure**: Alignment with M^0’s role in decentralizing stablecoin design.  
- **DeFi Adoption**: Integration of USDN into Cosmos’s future financial ecosystem.  
- **Circle & CCTP**: Collaboration to democratize access to Cosmos via native USDC.

Cosmos-based Noble first to launch custom stablecoin using cryptodollar infrastructure startup M^0

The Cosmos-based Noble blockchain is the first to launch a new dollar-denominated token, USDN, using decentralized stablecoin infrastructure provided by stablecoin upstart M^0, according to an announcement on Thursday. USDN will leverage $M as its âcore building blockâ to provide the broader Interchain ecosystem with âa credibly neutral digital dollar,â the company said in a statement. 

âThis collaboration not only advances Cosmos-native stablecoin adoption but sets a new precedent for stablecoin design by focusing on safety, programmability, and interoperability,â Noble CEO Jelena Djuric said. âWeâre excited to redefine what stablecoin infrastructure can achieve within decentralized finance.â

Super excited to be working with the @noble_xyz team. 
Stablecoins and other RWAs are some of the fastest growing products in crypto. Through Noble, they'll be a big part of Cosmos's bright future.

since launching 18 months ago @noble_xyz has

- brought usdc to cosmos
- issued $450m+ in stables & rwa
- facilitated 5b+ in volume
- surpassed polygon, avalanche, near, sui & optimism in usdc issuance
- raised a $15m paradigm-lead series a

how can you not be bullish?

Circle and Noble bring native USDC to Cosmos via CCTP

Noble is an appchain built for native asset issuance in Cosmos and the boundless Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) ecosystem.

Took 2 seconds to deposit USDC from @noble_xyz directly to @coinbase.

Feels good!

M^0 and Noble set sights on Tetherâs $136B empire

Programmable yield, seamless swaps and decentralized control are the hallmarks of a new stablecoin model.

ð Huge congratulations to our partners at @noble_xyz on their successful $15M Series A raise, led by @paradigm! 

ð $5B in volume in one year is only the beginning.
