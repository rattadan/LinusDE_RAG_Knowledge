## Chunk 23

**Original Text:**

Warm starting the channels kicks off Skip’s intelligent routing suggestions for folks bridging to and from your chain. We choose routes between chains that ensure users are always receiving the most desirable version of their chosen token on their destination chain. As a part of providing good user experiences for everyone using the API, we don’t enable users to bridge assets to new chains where no one has previously bridged that asset. (Often times, for ordinary users, taking an existing token to a chain it doesn’t exist leaves them stuck on that new chain with a useless token). That’s why we need to “warm start” channels — to enable recommending them as bridging routes.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

So, Warm Starting channels is a feature designed by Skip that suggests intelligent routing options for users trying to bridge tokens between different chains. This feature aims to provide the most desirable version of each chosen token on its destination chain, while also ensuring that users don't inadvertently create unused or orphaned tokens.

By enabling "warm starting" channels, Skip's API is creating a mechanism for users to discover and explore available bridging routes between chains without any unnecessary hurdles. This means that ordinary users can take an existing token from one chain and transfer it to another chain without having to start from scratch, as they'll be automatically directed towards the most desirable version of their chosen token on the destination chain.

This feature is essential for providing a good user experience across all API users, especially those who may not have prior knowledge or experience with bridging tokens between different chains. By simplifying this process, Skip's innovative routing suggestions aim to empower more people to participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and make it easier for them to interact with various blockchain networks.
