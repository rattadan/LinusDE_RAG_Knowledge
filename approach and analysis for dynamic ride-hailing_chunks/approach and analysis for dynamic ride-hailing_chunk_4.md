I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

The proposed method is then only evaluated in
this fixed setting, often without analyzing dependencies between these
problem characteristics and the solution quality. Furthermore, many
proposed assignment strategies share similarities in certain features
and could therefore be applied in different problem settings. What is
urgently missing, in our opinion, is a deeper analysis of which of the
possible strategy features play a role in which problem setting since at
least some of the features are highly dependent on the specific setting
at hand. We want to close this research gap by means of an extensive
discussion and computational study to be able to determine the best
strategies for a given setting. Mobility-on-demand represents a comfortable and flexible alternative to classic public transport or personal vehicles. Over the past
decade, these services have continued to gain popularity among the
public as well as researchers in the logistics area.
