# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_36.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.optimism.io/*

### Document Overview  
This content outlines the reliability, risks, and operational considerations of using Optimism’s public blockchain, emphasizing network variability, transaction irreversibility, smart contract risks, and the challenges of digital asset management and bridging.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Public Blockchain Systems**: Transactions are subject to variability in cost, speed, and availability.  
- **Irreversible Transactions**: Public blockchain transactions (e.g., smart contracts) are irreversible once confirmed.  
- **Smart Contract Execution**: Transactions interacting with smart contracts require extreme caution due to potential errors or dependencies.  
- **Digital Assets**: Users own and manage assets via Web3 Wallets, bearing risks of loss, volatility, and technical failures.  
- **Bridging**: Transferring assets between networks involves risks of delays, errors, or technical issues.  
- **Stablecoins**: May lack stability, be improperly collateralized, or face market panics.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Network Cost & Performance**: Optimism’s network prioritizes performance but allows for variable costs and delays, requiring users to optimize transaction strategies.  
- **Smart Contract Risks**: Transactions involving smart contracts must be carefully validated to avoid unintended consequences (e.g., gas fees, data integrity).  
- **Digital Asset Management**: Users are responsible for safeguarding assets, including risks of value fluctuations, hacks, or technical outages.  
- **Bridging Mechanisms**: Bridging processes may require careful handling to prevent errors, such as incorrect token balances or orphaned transactions.  

### Related Topics  
- **Network Reliability**: The document connects to broader discussions on decentralized systems and operational risks.  
- **Smart Contract Security**: Risks outlined here align with technical specifications for secure contract execution.  
- **Digital Asset Management**: The text overlaps with topics on secure asset storage and volatility management in blockchain ecosystems.

will not become unavailable, degraded, or subject to hardware or software errors, operational or technical difficulties, denial-of-service attacks, other cyberattacks, or other problems requiring maintenance, interruptions, delays, or errors.
- Network cost and performance.The cost, speed, and availability of transacting on public blockchain systems are subject to significant variability. There is no guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred successfully or in a timely manner.
- Blockchain transactions and smart contract execution.Public blockchain-based transactions (including but not limited to transactions automatically executed by smart contracts) are generally considered irreversible when confirmed. Any transaction that will interact with smart contracts or be recorded on a public blockchain must be recorded with extreme caution.
- Digital assets.You own and control the digital assets held in and bridged via your Web3 Wallet. You bear all risk of loss of and relating to such digital assets, including but not limited to fluctuations in value. The markets for digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to various risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. Digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks are complex emerging technologies that may be subject to delays or halts, or go offline, as a result of errors, forks, attacks or other unforeseeable reasons. Anyone can create a digital asset, including fake versions of existing digital assets and digital assets that falsely claim to represent projects. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs. You are solely responsible for understanding the risks specific to each digital asset that is relevant to you.
- Bridging.
