## Chunk 15

**Original Text:**

RequestCancellation
Before receiving or accepting proposals, passengers can broadcast a RequestCancellation to signify that
their request is no longer active. The "acceptedProposalID" field is used to prevent multiple drivers from
accepting the same ride request and to ensure that only one driver is assigned to each ride request. If a
driver receives a ride request with an "acceptedProposalID" field that matches their own ID, it means that
they have already accepted the request and should not take any further action. If a driver receives a ride request with an "acceptedProposalID" field that does not match their own ID, it means that another driver has
already accepted the request, and the driver should disregard the request and wait for another one. RequestCancellation {
String id;
String source;
String requestID;
String acceptedProposalID;
}

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing a specific data structure or protocol used in ride-hailing or transportation services, likely in a mobile app or API. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a detailed explanation.

However, based on the information provided, here are some general aspects that can be inferred about RequestCancellation:

1. **Purpose**: RequestCancellation is intended to prevent duplicate requests and ensure only one driver is assigned to each ride request.
2. **Data structure**: The data structure contains fields for:
    * `id`: a unique identifier (likely a string or UUID)
    * `source`: the source of the request
    * `requestID`: an identifier specific to the request
    * `acceptedProposalID`: the ID of the driver who has already accepted the request

Without more information about how this data structure is used in practice, it's challenging to provide further details on how RequestCancellation works.

If you have any specific questions or if there's a particular aspect of RequestCancellation you'd like me to expand upon, please let me know.
