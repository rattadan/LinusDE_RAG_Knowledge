**Original Text:**

While further
investigations delve into aspects like ‘access time’ (Fielbaum, Bai, and Alonso-Mora 2021;
Gurumurthy and Kockelman 2020; Martinez and Viegas 2017; Tikoudis et al. 2021) or ‘service time’ (Soth et al. 2023) – focusing on pedestrian travel duration to and from PUDO
locations – there remains a gap in explicitly specifying the stop time for vehicles during
PUDO events across these studies. Among the DRT studies that provide stop time information, there is a wide variation in
the estimates for the duration of a PUDO event (see Table 1). For instance, Schlüter et al. (2021) evaluated the integration of an autonomous DRT service aimed at connecting urban
and rural areas but excluded the time scale for PUDO events in their simulation, opting to
set the stop time parameter to 0 s. Lotze et al. (2023b) propose an adaptive stop pooling
approach in their simulation study and considered a stop time of 10 s, referring to the average stop time of PT systems presented in Dueker et al.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is discussing the technical details and parameters related to ride-pooling services, specifically focusing on:

1. **Technical details and processes**: The references provided highlight various aspects of ride-pooling services, including simulation studies (e.g., MATSim), technological aspects (e.g., autonomous vehicles, Waymo's app), and stop time management.
2. **Context building and connection to surrounding context**: This chunk connects the technical discussion to the broader context of urban transport systems and sustainability by discussing various studies that explore the impact of ride-pooling services on traffic congestion, carbon emissions, and motorized traffic in cities.
3. **Specific requirements and constraints**: The references mentioned include specific study titles (e.g., Fielbaum et al., 2021; Soth et al., 2023) and methodologies (e.g., DRT studies with stop time information), which highlight the need for more explicit specification of technical parameters, such as stop times for vehicles during PUDO events.

The chunk does not provide any new or innovative technical details but rather consolidates existing knowledge on ride-pooling services. However, it serves as a foundation for further research and provides context for understanding the broader themes discussed in the surrounding text.
