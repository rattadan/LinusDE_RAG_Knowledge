**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're referencing a scientific or academic paper on transportation economics. Lower-bound estimates are often used in studies to provide a theoretical minimum for costs associated with certain activities, such as fuel consumption or operating expenses.

In this context, lower-bound estimates refer to the lowest possible values that can be expected within a given range of variables. The range you provided is between 0.30 and 0.38 EUR per passenger-km, which suggests a study exploring the potential cost savings from more efficient transportation systems.

Reduced operating costs can indeed lead to lower expenses, and it's reasonable to expect that implementing measures to reduce these costs would result in further decreases.

The mention of "autonomous" is also relevant, as autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to significantly impact various sectors, including transportation. However, without more specific information from the paper you're referencing, it's difficult to say exactly how AVs are expected to affect operating costs.

Overall, it seems like the paper is discussing the potential benefits of reducing operating costs through technological advancements and improved efficiency in the transportation sector.
