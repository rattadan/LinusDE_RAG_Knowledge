**Original Text:**

One person will find the SMA the best moving average for crypto, but someone else might find the EMA better. Remember, risk management is the most crucial aspect of trading. Make sure that you don’t invest what you aren’t willing to lose, and always use a Stop Loss order. When using the Good Crypto app, you can place Stop Loss orders immediately when placing a trade. A Stop Loss order will be your safety exit in case your technical analysis has proven to be invalid. When a Stop Loss order hits, we recommend that it doesn’t cost you more than 1% or 2% of your total portfolio. Now, let’s look at how we can trade this very simple but essential indicator!
