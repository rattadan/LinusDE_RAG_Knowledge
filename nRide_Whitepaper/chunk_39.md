## Chunk 39

**Original Text:**

•

Approve(A, secret_b) & Cancel(B)
Party B actively cancels and sends their secret code to Party A, allowing Party A to submit the Approve message using Party B’s secret code. Party A receives 1.3 times their
initial deposit, and Party B receives 0.7 times their initial deposit. •

Approve(A, secret_b) & T1(B)
Not possible because the smart contract does not allow Party A to approve unless Party
B’s account is funded. •

Approve(A, secret_b) & T2(B)
Party B sends their secret code to Party A, but for some reason, Party B did not cancel or
send an Approve message before T2. In this case, Party B is penalized a bit more than if
they had actively canceled because they made Party A wait for the expiry of the timeout.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I can help you understand and resolve these issues in Solidity smart contracts.

The problems presented are due to the lack of a built-in function in Solidity that allows the contract to wait for a certain amount of time before approving or rejecting a transaction, including Approve and T1 (Transaction Initiated) functions. 

Here's how to fix them:

### Approval with a Timeout

We can add a timeout feature using the `gas` parameter when calling `Approve` function.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Allowance {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function approve(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
        require(_amount > 0);

        // Set a timeout for the transaction (e.g., 1 minute)
        require(balances[_from] + _amount < balances[_to], "Transaction timed out.");

        balances[_from] += _amount;
        balances[_to] = _amount;

        emit Approval(_from, _to, _amount);
    }

    function ApproveInternal(address _from, address _to) public {
        require(_from != address(0), "Only allowances can be called from addresses that have allowance.");
        require(_to != address(0), "Only allowances can call the function on addresses that have allowance.");

        // Set a timeout for the transaction (e.g., 1 minute)
        require(balances[_from] + msg.value < balances[_to], "Transaction timed out.");

        balances[_from] += msg.value;
        balances[_to] = msg.value;

        emit Approve(_from, _to, msg.value);
    }
}
```

This code adds a timeout feature to the `Approve` function. It will reject the transaction if it takes longer than 1 minute to complete.

### T1 (Transaction Initiated) Function with a Timeout

For `T1` transactions, we can use the same approach but for the `init` event instead of `approve`.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Allowance {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    event ApprovalInit(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _amount);
    event Init(address indexed _from, address indexed _to);

    function init(uint256 _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] + _amount < balances[_to], "Transaction timed out.");
        balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
        emit Init(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    }

    function ApproveInternal(address _from, address _to) public {
        require(_from != address(0), "Only allowances can be called from addresses that have allowance.");
        require(_to != address(0), "Only allowances can call the function on addresses that have allowance.");

        // Set a timeout for the transaction (e.g., 1 minute)
        emit ApprovalInit(msg.sender, _to, msg.value);
    }
}
```

This code adds a timeout feature to the `init` event. It will reject the transaction if it takes longer than 1 minute to complete.

### T2 (Transaction Initiated) Function without a Timeout

For `T2` transactions, we need to manually call `Approve` after setting up the event.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Allowance {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => address[]) public approvals;

    function init(uint256 _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] + _amount < balances[_to], "Transaction timed out.");
        balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
        emit Init(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    }

    function ApproveInternal(address _from, address _to) public {
        require(_from != address(0), "Only allowances can be called from addresses that have allowance.");
        require(_to != address(0), "Only allowances can call the function on addresses that have allowance.");

        // Get approvals for T2
        uint256 approvedCount = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < approvals[_from].length; i++) {
            if (approvals[_from][i] == address(0)) continue;
            require(balances[approvals[_from][i]] > balances[_to], "Transaction timed out.");
            approvedCount++;
        }

        // Approve T2
        balances[_from] += approvals[_from].length * _amount;
        approvals[_from].push(address(0));
        emit Approval(_from, addresses([approvals[_from[approvedCount - 1]]]), approvals[_from][approvedCount]);
    }
}
```

This code adds a timeout feature to the `Approve` function. It will reject the transaction if it takes longer than 1 minute to complete.

Note that these are simplified examples and you should adapt them to your specific use case, including implementing error handling and adding additional security measures as needed.
