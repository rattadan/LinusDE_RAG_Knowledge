## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 15

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

They discretize the service area by considering a finite set of
stations where vehicles can idle and customers enter and exit vehicles. Requests are rejected when a customer arrives at a station and there is
currently no vacant vehicle available. Zhang and Pavone (2016) aim to
balance demand and supply while minimizing the average number of
repositioning vehicles. Braverman et al. (2019) maximize the revenue
gained from serving requests. Both papers provide theoretically optimal
solutions for their specific problem formulations. Lastly, there are some approaches that combine assignment and
repositioning decisions into one single strategy. Kullman et al. (2021)
present such a combined approach based on reinforcement learning. In Al-Kanj et al. (2020), approximate dynamic programming is used and
pricing strategies are introduced to balance supply and demand. Guo
et al. (2021) present a matching-integrated vehicle rebalancing model
to optimize service rate and costs. A comparable approach is used
in Dandl et al.
