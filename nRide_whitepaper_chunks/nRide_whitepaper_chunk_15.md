This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

In the following section, we will describe the workings of
the escrow mechanism in detail, including the different stages of the process and the various outputs that
can result from its operation. 3.1. Functioning
The escrow smart-contract allows multiple users to create independent escrows. Each escrow involves two
users and has a unique id (for future calls to reference it) as well as other parameters that guard the state
transitions that are involved in the lifecycle of the escrow. Each escrow is composed of two accounts, each guarded by what we call a secret. Once an escrow is
funded by both parties, a user must obtain the other user’s secret to unlock all of their deposit, otherwise
they will lose a portion of it. In effect, the secret is simply the private component of a cryptographic key
pair created for the purpose of the escrow. When a user funds their account in the escrow, they create a new
key pair locally, and set the new public key as the ’lock’ of their account in the escrow.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the technical details of the escrow mechanism used in nRide, specifically its function, stages, outputs, and security parameters.

**Technical Details:**

* The escrow smart-contract allows multiple users to create independent escrows.
* Each escrow involves two users and has a unique id (for future calls to reference it) as well as other parameters that guard the state transitions involved in the lifecycle of the escrow.
* The secret accounts are guarded by what we call a "secret" that is used to unlock all of their deposit, otherwise they will lose a portion of it.
* When a user funds their account in the escrow, they create a new key pair locally and set the new public key as the 'lock' of their account in the escrow.

**Parameters:**

* Unique id (uid) for each escrow
* Parameters that guard the state transitions involved in the lifecycle of the escrow
* Secret accounts guarded by what we call a "secret"
* Public key set to the new lock for each escrow

**Processes:**

* Multiple users create independent escrows.
* Each escrow involves two users and has unique id, parameters, and secret accounts.

This chunk provides detailed technical information about how the escrow mechanism works in nRide, including its function, stages, outputs, and security parameters.
