I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

This is only true for those vehicles located in the parking lot in the
center of the lot zone. Additionally, vehicles towards the border of a
lot zone might be selected to serve a request that arose within their
range but outside of the respective lot zone. This would reduce the
supply without reducing the demand of this lot zone. Similarly, requests
towards the border of a lot zone might be served by vehicles outside of
the respective lot zone. Therefore, requests as well as vehicles are not
necessarily counted as 1 for supply and demand but as the proportion
of their individual range-zone (defined by the maximum waiting time
ùëáùëä as well) overlapping with the lot zone under consideration. Details
for calculating the overlapping area are given in Appendix B. On the
demand side, an additional special case has to be taken into account:
Requests in areas with few parking lots might have a total overlapping
proportion of less than 1.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details and parameters involved in dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.

The key points discussed include:

* Dynamic dispatch refers to the process of assigning vehicles to passenger requests in real-time, taking into account factors such as vehicle location, parking lot boundaries, and request proximity.
* The section mentions several methods for calculating overlapping areas between a request's range zone (defined by the maximum waiting time ùëáùëä) and the parking lot zone. These include:
	+ Bischoff & Maciejewski (2016): Using simulation to model autonomous taxi deployment in Berlin
	+ Ho et al. (2018): Survey on dial-a-ride problems, which includes a discussion of demand forecasting methodologies for ride-hailing systems
* The section also touches on dynamic repositioning strategies, including:
	+ Geng et al. (2019): Spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network for demand forecasting
	+ Jiao et al. (2021): Real-world ride-hailing vehicle repositioning using deep RL
* The rebalancing strategy mentioned involves:
	+ Guo et al. (2021): Robust vehicle rebalancing in ride-hailing systems with uncertain demand
	+ Dandl et al. (2019): Evaluating spatio-temporal demand forecast impact on shared mobility

The context of this chunk is the surrounding text, which discusses dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, including:

* The references provided are key papers and surveys that discuss various aspects of simulation, modeling, demand forecasting, and rebalancing strategies.
* The discussion highlights the importance of accounting for vehicle location, parking lot boundaries, and request proximity when calculating supply and demand.
* The section also notes a special case on the demand side, where requests in areas with few parking lots might have a total overlapping proportion of less than 1.

The requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned include:

* Uncertainty in demand ( uncertain demand)
* Limited parking lot availability
* Variability in request proximity and vehicle location
* Robustness to uncertainty in supply and demand

Overall, this section provides technical details on the complex problem of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.
