Driver virtual summit
We plan to host virtual summits focused on informing drivers of the benefits of the nRide driver registry
and the nRide application. The virtual summits will be designed to educate drivers on how nRide can help
them earn more money, reduce their costs, and streamline their work processes (application aggregation). We will offer small cash bonuses, token allocations, and exclusive Discord roles to incentivize attendance

getting started, making it easy for drivers to onboard during and after the event. Lastly, we will take the
time to garnish feedback from the drivers in attendance on how we can improve the nRide stack.
