<think>
Let me analyze these tweets/messages systematically to address each of the requested points.

First, let me examine the content:

1. "21M Bitcoin\n\n58M Millionaires" - This tweet references the capped supply of Bitcoin (21 million coins) and suggests it could create 58 million millionaires when distributed.

2. "Bitcoin will go up" - This is a straightforward bullish statement about Bitcoin's price.

3. "GM BITCOIN BROS! ☕️" - This appears to be a greeting to fellow Bitcoin enthusiasts, using crypto community jargon.

4. "100,000 Bitcoin is a few percentage points away\n\nIt’s inevitable" - This suggests the author believes Bitcoin's price is approaching $100,000.

5. "1.0 Bitcoin and your future is secured\n\nLess yapping more stacking" - This implies that holding a whole Bitcoin will secure one's financial future and encourages taking action rather than just talking.

6. "$BTC just hit a new all time high in Argentina…\n\nThis is why we need Bitcoin ⚡️" - This references Bitcoin's adoption in Argentina, suggesting real-world validation of its value.

   - Bitcoin's potential for creating millionaires
   - Bitcoin's price increase and future value (specifically mentioning $100k)

   - Encouraging holding/accumulating Bitcoin ("stacking")
   - Bitcoin as a solution to financial issues in countries with unstable currencies

2. Language style and tone:
   - Brief and concise - most tweets are very short
   - Confident and assertive
   - Optimistic and bullish about Bitcoin
   - Uses crypto community jargon ("GM BITCOIN BROS" which implies "Good Morning Bitcoin Brothers")
   - Emojis and symbols are used sparingly but effectively (⚡️, ☕️)
   - Lacks detailed explanations or nuanced discussion
   - The language is somewhat aspirational, focusing on financial outcomes

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:

   - There's no mention of any alternative cryptocurrencies
