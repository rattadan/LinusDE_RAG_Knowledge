I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

If the vehicle
is currently in state null and was not assigned to a pending request,
a repositioning order has to be given since idling is only allowed at
pre-defined, non-capacitated locations Óà∏ = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , ùêø}. The higher the
number of parking lots ùêø, the closer this setting is to ‚Äò‚Äòfree-floating‚Äô‚Äô
scenarios, where vehicles are allowed to idle everywhere. Repositioning
orders for vehicles are only executed if the vehicle was not assigned
to a pending request in the same decision epoch or was not already
busy setting up for or serving a request. Changing the destination of
a repositioning trip before the vehicle reaches the previously assigned
parking lot is allowed. We use different specifications to determine which vehicles are
available for receiving a new request:

4. Assignment strategies
In this section, we present and explain the strategies included
in our study for assigning available vehicles to open requests.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided text chunk, here's a focused analysis of what it's explaining:

**Technical Details:**

The technical details mentioned in this chunk are:

1. **Dynamic dispatch and repositioning**: The process of reassigning or relocating a vehicle from one location to another based on changes in demand.
2. **Repositioning orders**: A command given to the vehicle to move to a new location, which can only be executed when the vehicle was not already busy with a pending request or has reached its current parking lot.

**Context Connection:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Introducing the concept of dynamic dispatch and repositioning, which is closely related to the ride-hailing system's operation.
2. Providing an overview of the vehicle's state (currently in state "null" with no pending request), highlighting the need for repositioning orders.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

The requirements and conditions mentioned in this chunk are:

1. **Vehicle availability**: The vehicle must be available for receiving a new request if it's not already busy or if changing its destination before reaching the current parking lot is allowed.
2. **Pending requests and busy periods**: The vehicle cannot execute repositioning orders until it was assigned to a pending request in the same decision epoch (i.e., during the same time step) or has reached its current parking lot.

This chunk sets the stage for explaining assignment strategies, which are the focus of the surrounding context.
