Contextualizing the tweets:
The repeated use of "Nm" (not much) as a branding element suggests the author is trying to create a distinctive voice for the Noble brand. By using this casual phrase frequently, they're attempting to connect with audiences that appreciate more informal crypto culture while simultaneously promoting their products. The pattern of short "Nm" posts with varying enthusiasm levels ("Nm üòå", "Nm friends ‚ú®", "Nm!! üíú") shows they're experimenting with different ways to engage their audience and create a unique brand identity.

Putting this together, the tweets appear to be part of a coordinated marketing strategy to promote the Noble ecosystem's growth and innovations in stablecoin technology, particularly around their "composable yield" concept. The account is likely managed by a marketing team or individual promoting Noble's products and services.
