## Chunk 27

**Original Text:**

After arriving at the destination stop, the agent walks to the destination. 2.2. DRT speed up
To speed up the simulation experiments, in this study, an approximation approach is developed which is somewhat
similar to the approach by [4]. In contrast to [4], the proposed approximation approach accounts for the specific
characteristics of the DRT module (for example the DRT pricing scheme) and only approximates the DRT mode,
whereas, all other modes are simulated without any modification. During the first n iterations, the DRT mode is only
simulated in detail every k iterations.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you're providing a passage about a simulation experiment or study related to Dynamic Routing Tables (DRT). 

The text describes a method for simulating DRT experiments efficiently by developing an approximation approach compared to existing methods like the one mentioned in [4]. This approximation approach is designed to simulate specific aspects of the DRT module, such as its pricing scheme, while simplifying or omitting other modes. The key points from this passage are:

1. **Approximation approach**: A new method for simulating DRT experiments that is faster and more efficient than others.
2. **Specific characteristics of DRT module**: This approach takes into account unique features like the DRT pricing scheme.
3. **Detailed simulation only every k iterations**: In the initial stages, the proposed approach starts with a detailed simulation of the first 'n' iterations (in this case, n=1) and then gradually reduces the level of detail by skipping certain iterations until it reaches the desired level of accuracy.

This type of method would likely be used in computer network routing simulations to speed up complex calculations while still providing accurate results for specific scenarios or modes.
