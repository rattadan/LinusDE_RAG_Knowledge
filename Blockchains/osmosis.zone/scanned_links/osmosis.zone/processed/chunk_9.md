Speaking of the UI, I think osmosis has the best in class UI/UX for a DEX. Everything is clear, concise and they also make IBC transfers to/from the Osmosis chain completely frictionless.

This. This is the stuff that drives mass mainstream adoption. This is why osmosis has more users than any other chain in the IBC. This is why the Osmosis team is always intent on improving UI.  Ensure optimal user experience, you guarantee user retention. Simple as that.  Well done osmosisüëè

After 4+ yrs of collaboration and friendship with @sunnya97, we couldn't be more excited to back @osmosiszone.
 
They're leading the charge to bring IBC to market and build out the @cosmos ecosystem - as well as tackling fundamental problems, like MEV resistance and privacy.

What was your best moment in Cosmos so far? For me it was the Osmosis launch. Seeing IBC working for the first time with great UX was incredible.

The #Osmosis team is cracked.

the answer pretty simple;

users wanna trade on osmosis

because 
@osmosiszone
 is the HUB.

EIP 1559 on Osmosis is amazing

Every defi app should build on osmosis

Osmosis is not just one of the most active projects by dev activity (see @cryptomanran's post below), it's also the most active Cosmos chain for
governance activity EVERY SINGLE MONTH

@osmosiszone keeps shipping. $OSMO üß™

Osmosis as the Liquidity Hub ( We can crop around this post )

@osmosiszone has the best UI/UX in crypto hands down. I understand real yield is where the market is heading towards, but without attractive front ends, you won‚Äôt bring masses into web 3.

$osmo did it right and it‚Äôs a pleasure to use each time. They even do holidays.
