   - Financial advice: The author frequently gives advice about selling Cosmos projects, not holding through bear markets, and suggests alternative investments.
   - Bear market predictions: The author repeatedly warns about an upcoming bear market and suggests this might be the last chance to sell before it happens.
   - Memecoins vs "real" crypto: There's discussion about memecoins potentially outperforming other crypto during certain periods.
   - Disillusionment with Cosmos ecosystem: The author expresses frustration with the Cosmos ecosystem and its projects, calling it "scam after scam."
   - Comparing Cosmos to other blockchains: The author compares Cosmos negatively to other blockchains like Solana.
   - Price predictions: The author makes several price predictions, particularly that TIA (Celestia) will go below $1.
   - Market timing: The author mentions specific months (December/January) as optimal times to make money or exit positions.

2. Language style and tone:
   - Informal: The language is casual and conversational with frequent abbreviations like "smth" (something), "iam" (I am), etc.
   - Very negative: The tone is predominantly negative toward Cosmos projects with phrases like "scam after scam," "fucked," "retarded," and "shitcoins."

   - Contrarian: The author seems to take a contrarian view to positive sentiment about Cosmos projects.

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
   - The account appears to be part of the "Cosmos Airdrop Chat" channel, which seems to be a legitimate community around Cosmos airdrops.
   - The content itself is questionable in terms of legitimacy as financial advice. It's mostly opinionated, negative commentary without factual analysis or data to support claims.
   - Some statements might be considered FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) rather than objective analysis.
   - The messages contain predictions about market movements that could potentially be manipulative.
   - There doesn't appear to be any direct promotion of specific projects, but there are suggestions to sell Cosmos projects and buy others.
