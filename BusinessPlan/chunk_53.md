OPERATIONS & MANAGEMENT
Organizational Structure
nRide is structured as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which allows token holders to
participate in the management and decision-making of the company. As a DAO, nRide has no central
governing body, and decision-making is shared among its community members. The nRide Protocol and
DAO were created by its two co-founders, Martin Arrivets and Oluwadare Sobande. While the
co-founders currently hold the key decision-making authority, they aim to gradually transfer this power to
the nRide community as more people join the DAO.
