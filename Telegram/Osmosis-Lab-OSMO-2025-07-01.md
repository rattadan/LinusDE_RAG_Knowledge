## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different users discussing Osmosis, which seems to be a decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Cosmos ecosystem. 

First, I'll go through each message to understand the context. The most recent messages are at the top. User_1215740918 says "Soon will pump 5%"‚Äîprobably talking about a token price increase. Then SM12345678911 mentions the price dropping every day. Lponqs makes a joke about being exit liquidity if they don't pump, which is a common crypto meme about price manipulation.

User_343756695 argues that price only matters when buying/selling, which is a philosophical take. Monkeking420 points out the lack of marketing. Mikebarb talks about a vote passing with 92% yes, and Saeedivine is asking for voting results and a token burn. Mtsu22 mentions copying someone's name for Telegram, which might relate to impersonation or scams. JohnnyWyles87 and Alkia9 are discussing the project team's silence and the falling price of OSMO, with Alkia9 blaming the Atom ecosystem.

Lponqs again brings up Solana's price drop but advises investing responsibly. There's a joke about a "$0.10 flight" and some mentions of partnerships, collaborations, and support links. Then there's a news update about Osmosis launching Polaris, a Token Portal, and expanding DeFi products. Users are concerned about the mobile app delay, token deflation, and issues with relayers and IBC transfers. Davidjgoosey mentions exploring tokenized stocks on Osmosis and Polaris, and addressing regulatory issues.

Key points I notice: OSMO price is falling, there's a vote in progress (June proposal with 92% yes), token burn and deflationary measures are suggested, marketing is lacking, Polaris launch as a new product, issues with Wormhole gateway and frontend, partnership inquiries, and the mobile app delay. Also, some users are frustrated with the team's inaction, and there's a mention of institutional interest possibly helping.

I need to structure this into a concise summary. Start with the main issues

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or subjects.

Looking at the messages, there's a lot of discussion about token price. Users mention the price dropping, memes about price, and someone suggesting a token burn. Then there's talk about marketing issues, like the project lacking marketing efforts. 

Another topic is the Polaris Token Portal. JohnnyWyles87 and others mention it being a new product, connecting to other chains, and tokenized stocks. Then there's the mobile app delay; lponqs is frustrated about the app not launching yet.

Institutional adoption comes up when lponqs mentions that if institutions come in, things might change. Tokenomics and deflationary measures are discussed by ips14 and others wanting the token to be deflationary to stop the price drop.

Governance and voting are present with mikebarb talking about a vote passing and Saeedivine asking about voting results. Partnership inquiries from musbik1 asking who to contact for collaborations.

There's a mention of a Wormhole gateway issue affecting Solana tokens on Osmosis, with users checking if their holdings are safe. Technical issues like IBC and relayer problems are noted by Chessmany3k. 

Community sentiment is all over the place‚Äîcomplaints about trust, people buying despite negativity, and some humor. Lastly, the Osmosis team's communication is a topic, with Alkia9 asking why they're silent and Bozoklufatih questioning their actions.

I should make sure each of these is a distinct topic and list them without repeating. Let me check again to see if I missed anything. The user names and timestamps are part of the messages but not topics. The links and mentions of specific accounts like @sunnya97 might relate to the topics but not the main subjects themselves. Yeah, the main topics are the ones I listed. Now, format them as a comma-separated list.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

The text is a series of chat messages from different users. Some are asking questions, others are making comments or complaints. The main subject seems to be Osmosis, a cryptocurrency project, and its token OSMO. 

Looking at the first few messages, user_1215740918 says "Soon will pump 5%". "Pump" usually refers to a price increase, so that's positive. Then SM12345678911 says "price lower every day", which is negative. lponqs's message about ending up as someone's exit liquidity with a laughing emoji might be sarcastic, indicating frustration, so negative. user_343756695's comment about price being a meme unless you're buying/selling seems neutral but maybe a bit dismissive.

Monkeking420 mentions "Problem is no marketing" ‚Äì that's a negative point. mikebarb and Saeedivine are discussing votes and token burns, which are neutral but show engagement. mtsu22's message about copying names for Telegram profiles seems neutral but possibly a security concern. The emojis in JohnnyWyles87's message suggest a positive or playful tone. Alkia9 is critical, saying "Whole Atom ecosystem is fucked" which is clearly negative. 

lponqs has a longer message comparing crypto to hell and advising to invest only what you can lose, which is negative but also has a resigned or cautionary tone. The mention of a mobile app needing to launch and falling behind is another negative. Bozoklufatih is complaining about the team not acting to support the token price, which is negative. 

There's a link to a news post about Osmosis's H1 2025 recap, which might be positive as it's an official update. However, user comments like "token deflationary" and "price lower every day" continue the negative sentiment. Some users are discussing technical issues like IBC transfers being stuck or relayer problems, which are negative. 

There are also neutral messages like asking about staking rewards or partnership contacts. The token burn and marketing requests indicate users want improvements, showing dissatisfaction. The use of words like "scammer

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any that indicate a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a planned step forward.

Starting from the top, user_1215740918 says, "Soon will pump 5%." That sounds like an action item, but I need to clarify what "pump" refers to. Maybe increasing liquidity or price by 5%? Not entirely sure, but it's a commitment to an action, so I'll note it.

Next, SM12345678911 mentions, "price lower every day." This seems more like an observation than an action item. Similarly, lponqs's comment about exit liquidity is a warning rather than a task.

user_343756695's message about price being a meme when not trading is a perspective, not an action. Monkeking420 points out a lack of marketing, which could be a problem but not an explicit next step. Mikebarb says, "It typically passes. It's currently at 92% yes," which might refer to a governance vote passing. That's a decision or status update.

Saeedivine asks to announce voting results, so that's a request for an action. Then, mikebarb mentions "Junes is up for vote now," indicating a current governance proposal. Saeedivine also asks about a token burn, which is a query but could imply considering it as a next step.

mtsu22's message about copying names in Telegram seems unrelated. JohnnyWyles87 and Alkia9 discuss the project team and Osmosis's issues, which are concerns but not actions. Bozoklufatih complains about the team's actions and suggests new listings or ads, so that's a potential next step suggestion.

Fuerzaaaaa tags someone and asks for opinions, which is engagement but not an action item. User_343756695 again talks about Osmosis and Polaris being a one-stop shop, which is a vision statement. ips14 suggests making the token deflationary to stop price drops, so that's a proposed action.
