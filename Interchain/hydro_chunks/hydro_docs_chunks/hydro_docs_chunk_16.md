**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

Total APR â€“ The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR, which benefits the Cosmos Hub community pool. These APRs fluctuate based on market conditions, bidder incentives, and liquidity deployments. Below, we break down the APRs specific to Hydro in detail. ## Voter APR
---------

### Average APR
-----------

The Hydro bids page displays the average APR available to Hydro voters. It is calculated by dividing the dollar value of the sum of all available tributes posted during the active round by the total dollar value of the locked voting power in Hydro.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Analysis:**

1.  **Exact technical details and parameters**: The text chunk explains two APR calculations: Total APR and Voter APR. 
    -   Total APR is the sum of liquidity yield generated by DeFi protocols and voter APR. 
    -   Voter APR is calculated from the dollar value of tributes posted during a round divided by the total dollar value of locked voting power in Hydro.

2.  **Connection to surrounding context**: The text chunk relates to the "APRs and Rewards" section, describing in detail the mechanics behind the Total APR and Voter APR metrics. It expands upon the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) aspect of the Cosmic Hub ecosystem.

3.  **Requirements, conditions, or constraints**: None  mentioned in the text chunk.

**Practical Analysis**:

1.  The chunk explains two essential components of the Hydro platform: Total APR and Voter APR.
2.  Shows how these APRs are derived from the market conditions and liquidity deployments.
3.  The voting power and APY can influence user decision making within the platform.

**Platform APR specifics**:

*   **Total APR**: Sums the yields from DeFi deployments and the voter APR.
*   **Voter APR**: A calculation based on tributes posted during an active round and locked voting power in Hydro.
*   Requires the dollar values of tributes posted and locked voting power to be accessible across all rounds.
