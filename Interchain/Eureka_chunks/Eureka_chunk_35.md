## Eureka - Chunk 35

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

​
Set up the SkipClient to use a Solana wallet
All you need to do is initialize the getSVMSigner method in SkipClient.options to extract the @solana/wallet-adapter-base from the user’s connected wallet of choice:

TypeScript

Copy
import { useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { PhantomWalletName } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom"
import { SkipClient } from '@skip-go/client';

const { wallets } = useWallet();

const skipClient = new SkipClient({
  getSVMSigner: async (chainID) => {
		const { svm } = trackWallet.get();
		const solanaWallet = wallets.find((w) => w.adapter.name === PhantomWalletName);
    return solanaWallet
  }
});
After this point, you can use route, executeRoute, and the other methods of SkipClient as you normally would. The rest of these docs cover the underlying details of the data structures, in case you need them.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides detailed information about potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar General Messaging Protocol (GMP), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), and Hyperlane.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

1. **Timeouts or Slippage:** The text mentions that potential timeouts or slippage can occur during the asset transfer process.
2. **Tokens Being Sent Back to Source Chain:** If IBC or Axelar GMP fails, tokens may be sent back to the source chain due to timeout issues.
3. **Slipage Issues:** Similar to timeouts, tokens may also slip through the system if there are slippage issues during the asset transfer process.

**Connections and Building Upon Surrounding Context:**

1. This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing a detailed overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols.
2. The text references other related protocols, such as Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), and Hyperlane, which are also discussed in subsequent sections.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. The chunk requires users to set up a Solana wallet by initializing the `getSVMSigner` method on the `SkipClient.options`.
2. It assumes that the user's connected wallet is compatible with the chosen protocol and has access to the necessary adapters (e.g., @solana/wallet-adapter-base).

Overall, this chunk provides essential information for developers and users working with cross-chain asset transfer protocols, highlighting potential risks and recommending solutions to mitigate them.
