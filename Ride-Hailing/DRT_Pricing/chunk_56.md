**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems there's a formatting issue, but I'll assume you're asking me to highlight or explain certain points about the effects of transitioning from Private Transportation (PT), bicycle, and walk to Dedicated Rapid Transit (DRT) mode.

Regarding your question:

- It appears that for users switching from PT, bicycle, and walk to DRT mode, there are increased benefits in terms of beeline speed and travel time. This suggests a positive impact on travel efficiency.
- The graph or chart provided (Fig. 2 and 3) shows absolute numbers of DRT trips and the modes of transportation that would have been chosen under alternative scenarios without the DRT mode and without car tolls.

To provide a more detailed explanation, here are some key points to consider:

1. **Increased efficiency**: By using DRT mode, users can travel longer distances with fewer changes of vehicle, reducing overall travel time. This is likely due to the streamlined journey experience offered by DRT.
2. **Reduced walking and cycling**: By switching to DRT mode, cyclists and walkers would have been forced to take alternative routes that might not be as efficient or safe. For instance, they may have used less direct paths or experienced longer travel times.
3. **Less reliance on cars**: The car toll (base case) suggests that the transition from PT, bicycle, and walk to DRT mode has reduced the number of people relying solely on personal vehicles for transportation.
4. **Improved air quality and environment**: By promoting the use of public transport like DRT, you may be contributing to a cleaner and healthier urban environment.

It's essential to note that these points assume a specific context and analysis would provide more detailed insights into the effectiveness of transitioning from PT, bicycle, and walk to DRT mode. If you have any further questions or require additional information, feel free to ask.
