## Chunk 14

**Original Text:**

-3Additionally, the "Request" message may include a raw "data" field that can be used to encode arbitrary information. This field may be used to include additional information about the ride request, such as the passengerâ€™s profile information or any special instructions for the driver. Request {
String id;
String source;
double startLat;
double startLon;
String startAddress;
double endLat;
double endLon;
String endAddress;
[]byte data;
}

2.2.2. RequestCancellation
Before receiving or accepting proposals, passengers can broadcast a RequestCancellation to signify that
their request is no longer active. The "acceptedProposalID" field is used to prevent multiple drivers from
accepting the same ride request and to ensure that only one driver is assigned to each ride request.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're discussing two different concepts in the context of ride-sharing or transportation services:

1. **Request**: This appears to be a message structure representing a ride request made by a passenger. It includes fields such as `id`, `source`, `startLat`, `startLon`, `startAddress`, `endLat`, and `endLon`. The `data` field might contain additional information.

2. **RequestCancellation**: This is a mechanism used to notify the service that a previously accepted ride request is no longer active or desired. It involves broadcasting an "acceptedProposalID" (or a similar identifier) to signal cancellation.

To clarify, when would you typically use each of these concepts:

- You might use a Request in scenarios where passengers want to reserve a specific driver for their trip.
- You might use a RequestCancellation when a passenger wants to cancel or modify a previously accepted ride request due to changes in their plans or preferences.
