## Chunk 91

**Original Text:**

If the MVP shows that the escrow mechanism is not
effective in acting as cancellation fees, the nRide team will
reassess and implement a different system. Although it is an
important component of the overall protocol, it can be
switched out without overly impacting the rest of the
architecture. Confidence in Blockchain: Blockchain as an industry has a
troubled past, and recent scandals have severely affected the
confidence that the general public and investors place in this
technology. There is a risk that users dismiss nRide because it
uses this technology. The nRide team can reduce this risk by communicating
clearly, in the company blog and social media, about how and
why it uses blockchain as a technological enabler of
decentralisation.
