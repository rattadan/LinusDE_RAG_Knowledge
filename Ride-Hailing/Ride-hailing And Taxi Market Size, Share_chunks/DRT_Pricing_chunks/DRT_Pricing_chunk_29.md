## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 29

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

3: Previously chosen mode by DRT users – DRT service area: Berlin area

The effect of imposing a toll on car users. Implementing the DRT service and imposing a toll of 0.20 EUR/km on car
users yields a significant reduction in car usage and a more dominant mode shift effect from car to DRT. As shown
in Fig. 2d and 3d, more than a third of all DRT users come from the car mode. The car trip share in the Berlin area
decreases by approx. 12% (minimum DRT fee: 3 EUR), and PT, bicycle, walk and DRT trip shares increase. 1 The number of DRT trips is limited by the fleet size which is fixed to 10,000 vehicles. Additional simulation experiments which are carried out
to investigate the impact of the fleet size indicate that a fleet of 20,000 vehicles results in approx. 1 million DRT trips, and an even larger fleet size
of 100,000 vehicles motivates additional users to switch to the DRT mode, resulting in a total of approx. 1.5 million DRT trips. 812
