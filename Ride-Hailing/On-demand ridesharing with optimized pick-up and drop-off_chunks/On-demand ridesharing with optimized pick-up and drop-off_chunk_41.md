**Original Text:**

Set-cover is a classical combi­
natorial problem, and it is a well-known fact that, unless P = NP, it is impossible to find a polynomial algorithm whose result is
guaranteed to be not greater than η times the optimal result, for any η > 0 (Raz and Safra, 1997). We also analyze the more concrete
ways in which this is an obstacle when solving AP. 2.3.1. Complexity of calculating cost(τ, v)
Let us first analyze the problem of calculating cost(τ,v), i.e., for a given v and τ optimizing the sequence in which the requests in τ are
served together with their PUDO nodes. We will show that the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) can be reduced to this
problem. GTSP is an extension of TSP (Laporte et al., 1987), in which the nodes of the graph are divided into (possibly disjoint) subsets,
such that the traveling salesman has to visit at least one node per subset (instead of each node, as in the classical TSP). It is a known
result that GTSP is an extension of set-cover (Garg et al., 2000; Slavik, 1998).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Text Chunk:**

1. **Technical Details and Parameters:**
   - The problem is about calculating cost(τ,v) for a sequence of requests in τ with PUDO nodes.
   - This involves optimization techniques to minimize the total cost.

2. **Connection to or Building Upon Surrounding Context:**
   - The text chunk connects to its surrounding context by mentioning "Rebalancing Strategies", "Modeling and Mathematical Frameworks", "Optimization Heuristics", and "Simulation and Service Design" as key themes in a reference list covering various aspects of ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems.
   - It also builds upon these themes, providing specific technical details and parameters (e.g., the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem) to analyze.

3. **Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**
   - The context requires analyzing combinatorial optimization problems that are challenging due to P = NP hardness.
   - The specific requirements include guaranteeing a polynomial-time algorithm for solving such problems and overcoming the obstacle posed by set-cover when solving AP.

**Analysis of Connection to the Surrounding Context:**

The text chunk connects to its surrounding context through the following connections:

- It mentions key themes in ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems, indicating that the problem being analyzed is relevant to these topics.
- It discusses mathematical frameworks (e.g., set-cover) used to analyze such problems, further establishing its connection to the broader context.

**Analysis of Specific Requirements:**

The text chunk explicitly states requirements for:

1. Analyzing combinatorial optimization problems.
2. Guaranteeing a polynomial-time algorithm for solving such problems.
3. Overcoming the obstacle posed by set-cover when solving AP (Aho et al., 2010).

These specific requirements are crucial to understand and apply in the context of ridesharing systems, where efficient algorithms are necessary to optimize service delivery.

**Analysis of Specific Constraints:**

The text does not explicitly mention constraints related to P = NP hardness or set-cover, but it implicitly references Raz and Safra's result (Raz and Safra, 1997) that suggests the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem is at least as difficult. This highlights a critical challenge in solving AP, which the text aims to address by analyzing the problem of calculating cost(τ,v).
