## Chunk 8

**Original Text:**

If you’re integrated directly with the REST endpoints, you can find the relevant types in the API reference for the Route Operation and for the Lifecycle Tracking Transfer. Eureka
Security properties
Depending on where it is deployed, IBC Eureka might have different security properties compared to the ones in IBC Classic. This is mainly because EVM chains do not have any form of governance, whereas Cosmos chains do. To improve protocol and fund safety at launch, IBC Eureka is going to launch in stages, delineated by improved security properties at each stage. ​
Launch stage (0)
At launch, IBC Eureka is going to be deployed on two blockchains: Ethereum and Cosmos Hub mainnet.
