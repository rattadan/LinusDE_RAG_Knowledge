## ICS - Chunk 42

**Document Summary:**

The development of Interchain Security (ICS) for the Cosmos ecosystem represents a significant milestone that paves the way for greater interoperability, security, and economic growth among blockchain networks. Here are some key points summarizing the current state and future outlook:

### Key Achievements:
1. **Replicated Security Launch:**
   - The first consumer chains have successfully launched with replicated security, sharing the validator set of the Cosmos Hub.
   - This model ensures that any attack on a consumer chain would impact the entire ecosystem as much as it would affect the Cosmos Hub itself.

2. **Opt-in Security Development:**
   - Informal Systems and other contributors are working to develop opt-in security, allowing validators to choose which chains they wish to secure independently.
   
3. **Subset Problem Resolution:**
   - The "subset problem" has been identified and is being addressed through the design of new governance proposals, like slash proposals, to mitigate potential attacks.

4. **Mesh Security Research:**
   - Ongoing research into mesh security aims to create a network of interdependent blockchains where validators can participate in multiple chains without compromising security.

### Upcoming Steps:
1. **Opt-in Security Implementation:**
   - Finalizing and deploying opt-in security will provide more flexibility for validators, allowing them to distribute their staked ATOM across different consumer zones.

2. **Mesh Security Design:**
   - Continuing the research and development of mesh security to ensure a robust and secure network of interconnected blockchains.
   
3. **Economic Zone Development:**
   - The ATOM Economic Zone is expected to bring innovative economic opportunities for its members, such as shared validator sets and enhanced inter-IBC functionalities.

4. **Interoperability Enhancements:**
   - Improving IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) functionality, including synchronous IBC, atomic IBC, and packet forwarding, to enhance user experience and security across the ecosystem.

### Long-term Vision:
1. **Sustainable Ecosystem Growth:**
   - By sharing the same validator set, consumer chains can benefit from increased security without needing their own validators, reducing costs and improving overall network resilience.
   
2. **Increased Adoption and Innovation:**
   - The interdependent nature of these blockchain networks is expected to drive innovation and adoption, as developers can leverage the combined strengths of multiple blockchains.

3. **Economic Opportunities:**
   - ATOM holders and validators will have more avenues for earning transaction fees and MEV (Miner Extracted Value) rewards across various zones.
   
### Conclusion:
The launch of Interchain Security marks a significant advancement in the interoperability landscape, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure blockchain ecosystem. As development continues, the Cosmos ecosystem is poised to offer new opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration among its members.

Read more details in the proposal. Stride proposes a revenue share across four different areas:

15% of liquid staking rewards
15% of STRD inflationary staking rewards
15% of MEV revenue
15% of transaction fees

Core contributors have been working on Interchain Security for a couple of years, and continue to research and develop subsequent versions. This substantial timeline is necessary to properly analyze the risks and ensure that this shared security model for Cosmos does not expose the ecosystem to any unnecessary hazards. During initial research for replicated security, for example, Cosmos co-founder and CEO of AiB, Jae Kwon, detected a potential problem with automatic slashing.
