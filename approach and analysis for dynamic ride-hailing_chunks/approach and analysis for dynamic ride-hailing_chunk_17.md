**Original Text:**

(2016),
it is taken into account that vacant vehicles cannot necessarily idle
everywhere. Therefore, pre-defined parking lots are considered for
vehicles to wait for their next request assignment. The real-world settings in which these ride-hailing problems occur
are most often typical taxi services. In Alonso-Mora et al. (2017)
and Wallar et al. (2018), sharing a trip with other customers is additionally possible. Car-sharing systems are examined in studies such
as De Souza et al. (2020), Fagnant and Kockelman (2014), and Spieser
et al. (2016), the first two of which use autonomous vehicles. Bischoff
and Maciejewski (2016) go one step further and investigate the possibility of replacing all private cars in Berlin with autonomous taxis. In Kullman et al. (2021), Al-Kanj et al. (2020), and Lu et al. (2012),
electric vehicles are used, extending the problem by adding charging
decisions.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details of dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems, focusing on pre-defined parking lots as a viable alternative to traditional vehicle allocation strategies.

**Context:** The surrounding context is the provided document list of key references on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems. This chunk is specifically discussing how these ride-hailing problems occur in typical taxi services, and how they can be mitigated using pre-defined parking lots as a substitute for traditional vehicle allocation strategies.

**Technical details:** The technical details being described are:

* Pre-defined parking lots: These are areas designated for vehicles to wait for their next request assignment.
* Real-world settings: Typical taxi services are mentioned as the most common environments in which these ride-hailing problems occur.
* Sharing a trip with other customers: This option is also considered, but it's not explicitly detailed in this chunk.

**Building upon the context:** The chunk builds upon the provided document list by connecting to and expanding on the topic of dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems. It provides specific examples and references that support the idea that pre-defined parking lots can be used as a viable alternative to traditional vehicle allocation strategies.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

* Vacant vehicles cannot necessarily idle everywhere (as mentioned by Bischoff & Maciejewski, 2016)
* Real-world settings are typically typical taxi services
* Sharing a trip with other customers is possible in Alonso-Mora et al. (2017) and Wallar et al. (2018)
* Electric vehicles can be added to the problem by Al-Kanj et al. (2020) and Lu et al. (2012)

Overall, this chunk is explaining how dynamic dispatch strategies can be adapted to address real-world scenarios in ride-hailing systems using pre-defined parking lots as a viable alternative.
