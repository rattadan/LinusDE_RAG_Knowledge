## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify what's important.

Starting from the latest messages and moving up. The user_7164487109 is having trouble with the support button not working. Mikebarb suggests pressing the bottom right icon and mentions opening a ticket. Osmosis_statbot provides the support site link. So the key point here is the support issue and the suggested solutions.

Then there's a discussion about airdrop.axone.xyz legitimacy. User_575466224 asks if it's legit, and mikebarb says he can't vouch for the team. So the decision here is caution advised on the airdrop.

Looking at the earlier messages, there's a question about the best wallet for Osmosis tokens. The conversation then shifts to other initiatives for Osmo tokenomics, specifically mentioning net deflationary changes, reducing inflation, and increasing taker fees. BasementNodes and mikebarb discuss permissionless Wasm contracts and security risks. Mrtiahou asks why Osmosis isn't permissionless yet, and mikebarb suggests discussing on the forum.

Withdrawal times and fees for SOL from Osmosis to Phantom wallet are mentioned, with griffin_web3 stating it varies but typically takes a couple of minutes to 2 hours. Mahyarblue asks about fees and options Portal vs Picasso, but the response is brief.

SuperEra mentions a proposal for $ALLIN GAMING on Osmosis with a link to the forum. Then there's a question about burning 50% of taker fees, with Mrtiahou clarifying it's only for OSMO taker fees, not others. User_319582897 is confused about the burn amount versus collected fees. 

Other messages include OmniFlix.tv's interactive voting, accessing USDN via Keplr, and some unrelated comments about software engineers and AI. Also, a Reddit link about DEXs. 

So the main points are: support button issues, airdrop caution, tokenomics changes (deflationary, inflation reduction, taker fees), permissionless Wasm discussion, withdrawal times and fees, ALLIN GAMING proposal, taker fee burn clarification, and USDN onboarding

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as comma-separated. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects.

Starting with the earliest message: "Good news for dexs" ‚Äì that's about DEXs (decentralized exchanges) getting positive updates. Then "How to access usdn via keplr?" ‚Äì here the topic is USDN and Keplr wallet. Next, someone mentions onramping through Kado, so Kado onramp is another point. 

Looking at another message: "Voting on Osmosis proposals directly from interactive videos on OmniFlix.tv" ‚Äì this relates to Osmosis proposals and OmniFlix.tv. There's also a mention of a proposal to burn 50% of OSMO taker fees, so burning OSMO taker fees would be a topic. 

Another user asks about the best wallet for Osmosis tokens, so wallet recommendations. Then there's a discussion about airdrop tokens, specifically Axone airdrop mentioned earlier. The support button issue and contacting admins are also mentioned, so support issues and contacting admins. 

Someone asks why there's no Facebook page for Osmosis DEX, so social media presence. The question about Osmosis not being permissionless yet leads to permissionless WASM. There's also a mention of security risks with allowing contracts, so security risks. 

Other topics include withdrawal fees and times, using Squid Router, deflationary tokenomics, and a proposal for $ALLIN GAMING. Also, a software engineer offering services, but that might be less relevant. 

I need to make sure each topic is distinct and not repeated. For example, support issues are mentioned a few times, so consolidate that. Airdrops come up with Axone and another link, so maybe just airdrop legitimacy. Also, the taker fees burning proposal is a key point. 

Let me list them out: DEXs, Osmosis support issues, USDN access via Keplr, Kado onramp, Osmosis proposals, OmniFlix.tv voting, burning OSMO taker fees, wallet recommendations, airdrop legitimacy (Axone), social media presence (Facebook), permissionless WASM, security risks, withdrawal fees/times, Squid Router, deflationary tokenomics

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from Osmosis DEX. I need to go through each one and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Then, I'll summarize the overall sentiment.

Starting with the first message: "Can you press the one in the bottom right? Should be little icon" ‚Äì that's a user asking for help, but it's a straightforward request. No clear positive or negative emotion here, so neutral.

Next: "It‚Äôs not allowing me to press on the support button. Nothing happens when I attempt to" ‚Äì this user is frustrated because a button isn't working. Definitely negative.

Then there's a bot message directing to support site. Bots usually just provide info, so neutral.

Another message: "You can open a ticket and we can help" ‚Äì helpful response, so positive.

The user asking about admins for a problem ‚Äì again, a request for help, neutral.

The following messages about airdrops, tokenomics, and technical discussions seem to be factual or cautious. For example, "As always be careful when claiming. Personally waiting for a bit" ‚Äì cautious advice, so neutral leaning towards negative but since it's a precaution, maybe neutral.

The question about the legitimacy of an airdrop ‚Äì neutral, as it's a query without clear emotion.

Discussions about withdrawal times and fees are practical questions, neutral.

The message about a proposal submission seems positive, promoting their project. "GO ALLiN - soon on Osmosis" ‚Äì enthusiastic, so positive.

Comments on security risks and permissionless features ‚Äì neutral, as they're discussing pros and cons.

The Software engineer message with "who needs?" ‚Äì sarcastic or negative, but context might be a joke. However, without more context, it's negative.

The AI making professions useless ‚Äì negative sentiment.

Questions about burning fees and calculations ‚Äì neutral, just seeking information.

Overall, there are a mix of sentiments. The majority are neutral (questions, technical discussions), some negative (button not working, sarcastic remarks), and a few positive (proposal promotion, helpful responses). The most recent messages have some negative issues with the support button, but also positive about the proposal. The overall sentiment might lean neutral with some negative and positive elements, but need to check if the negative parts are more prominent. However, since the user might be looking for the general tone, considering the number of

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a series of chat messages from different participants, and I need to go through each one to identify any tasks, decisions made, or next steps mentioned.

Starting with the first message from mikebarb at 21:57:18. He asks someone to press the icon in the bottom right. That seems like an action item, maybe for the user to click on a specific button or link. Then the user_7164487109 at 21:56:28 says they can't press the support button. So maybe the next step here is to troubleshoot or fix the support button issue.

Looking at the osmosis_statbot message at 21:55:40, it directs users to the support site. That's a recommendation, so the action item here is visiting the support site. Similarly, mikebarb at 21:55:37 mentions opening a ticket for help, which is another action step for the user to take.

The user_7164487109 at 21:54:58 is asking about contacting admins. So the next step might be for them to reach out to admins, but the previous messages already provided the support site and ticket option, which might be the answer here.

Then there's a message from mikebarb at 21:52:35 about any team being able to airdrop tokens. That's more of a statement, but maybe a decision that teams can do airdrops. At 21:51:45, he advises being careful when claiming and mentions waiting, so the next step for users is to wait before claiming airdrops.

The user_575466224 shares a link and asks if it's a legit airdrop. The action item here is to verify the legitimacy of the airdrop at the provided link.

Moving to the messages from user_343756695 at 20:35:08, they're curious about future initiatives and tokenomics changes. Not sure if that's an action item unless the team needs to address it. Similarly, BasementNodes and mikebarb discuss security risks with contracts, which might
