The content suggests she's trying to understand and participate in the community ("who are @berabaddies and how to join them?").

Looking at the tweets more comprehensively, Maria seems to be particularly interested in Cosmos ecosystem and Berachain, with some engagement with broader crypto topics. She mentions EthCC, a real Ethereum conference, but also makes a comment suggesting Ethereum developments aren't her main focus. The tweet about "$ATOM at $5 again" shows price awareness and excitement about Cosmos specifically. Her asking about berabaddies shows she's trying to understand new projects and bring attention to them, positioning herself as a connector in the crypto space.

She uses a distinctive style mixing casual questions, price observations, and cultural references to engage with crypto Twitter.
