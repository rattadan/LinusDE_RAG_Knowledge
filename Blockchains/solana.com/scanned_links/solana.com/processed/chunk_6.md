### Document Overview  
This content explains Solana's RPC methods, network types (devnet, testnet, mainnet-beta), state commitment levels, and the structure of RPC responses for interacting with Solana nodes.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **State Commitment**: Determines how finalized a block is when querying the ledger (confirmed, finalized, or finalized-commitment).  
- **RPC Methods**: HTTP/Websocket APIs for interacting with Solana nodes, with parameters like `commitment` to control state accuracy.  
- **Network Types**:  
  - **devnet**: Development network for experimentation (e.g., airdropping SOL).  
  - **testnet**: Validator testing network (not for developer use).  
  - **mainnet-beta**: Live network for live transactions.  
- **RPC Response Structure**: Includes fields like `result`, `error`, and `meta` for transaction outcomes.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Commitment Parameters**: Clients can specify `commitment` (e.g., `confirmed`, `finalized`) to balance speed and safety.  
- **Network Configuration**: Devnet allows airdropping SOL via the Playground, requiring a wallet address and transaction fee.  
- **RPC Methods**:  
  - `bank_getAccount`: Retrieves account data with `commitment` parameters.  
  - `transaction_process`: Processes transactions with `commitment` to ensure state integrity.  
- **Response Structure**:  
  - `result`: Contains transaction details (e.g., `signature`, `status`).  
  - `error`: Describes errors (e.g., `AccountNotFound`).  

### Related Topics  
- **API Reference**: Details of RPC methods and their parameters.  
- **Bank State Query**: Explains how nodes use commitment levels to validate state.  
- **Node Configuration**: Describes how clients set `commitment` and network types for RPC interactions.

developer)
- mainnet-beta: The main Solana network for live transactions
- Creating new accounts to store data or deploy programs on the network
- Paying transaction fees when interacting with the Solana network
- Enter your wallet address (found at the bottom of the Playground screen) and
select an amount
- Click "Confirm Airdrop" to receive your devnet SOL

Interact with Solana nodes directly with the JSON RPC API via the HTTP and
Websocket methods.

For preflight checks and transaction processing, Solana nodes choose which bank
state to query based on a commitment requirement set by the client. The
commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When
querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to
report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back.

In descending order of commitment (most finalized to least finalized), clients
may specify:

For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to useconfirmedcommitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total
safety, it's recommended to usefinalizedcommitment.

If commitment configuration is not provided, the node willdefault tofinalizedcommitment

Only methods that query bank state accept the commitment parameter. They are
indicated in the API Reference below.
