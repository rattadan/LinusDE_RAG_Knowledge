## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user provided a chat log with various messages. My job is to focus on key points and decisions.

First, looking at the timestamps, the main issues start around 2024-09-22T19:35 onwards. The user chetcvale13 reports that the Wormhole PORTAL isn't connecting to OSMO. Others chime in about the problem. Svansy mentions OSMO is missing from the UI and that they have to switch to the "cosmos" tab. There's frustration about the Discord being full of "wen osmo" jokes, indicating delays or unresolved issues.

WorkerBee_3 suggests trying a different app and clearing cache. Then, kychuli says after upgrading to portal v2, OSMO isn't an option and there's no fallback to v1. Users hope for a fix. Earlier messages mention issues with removing liquidity via Ledger, needing CLI. Also, some positive comments about Polaris increasing volume for Osmosis and benefiting holders.

I need to condense this. Start with the main problem: Portal v2 issues affecting OSMO connections and missing Cosmos chains. Mention the lack of fallback to v1. Then user frustrations and workarounds suggested. Include the Ledger problem and the Polaris benefits. End with the support link from the bot.

Make sure it's concise, key points only. Avoid minor details like "I'll try that" or "congratz" unless they're decisions. Focus on the technical issues, user reactions, suggested solutions, and the Polaris impact.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Portal v2 Issues:** Users report Osmosis (OSMO) is missing from the upgraded Portal v2 UI, breaking cross-chain functionality (e.g., SOL to OSMO transfers). No fallback to v1 is available, and the team has only responded with "soon" for fixes.  
2. **Frustration:** Complaints about unresolved technical problems, poor communication, and Discord filled with "wen osmo" jokes. Users feel neglected despite long-term loyalty.  
3. **Workarounds Suggested:** Switching to the "Cosmos" tab in Portal or using alternative platforms like Picasso Network (https://app.picasso.network/) or Daodao for liquidity removal. CLI is required for Ledger users to remove liquidity.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the given text as a comma-separated list. The text is a series of chat messages related to Osmosis and some issues with the Portal bridge.

First, I need to go through each message and identify the key points. The earliest message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. Then there's a lot of discussion about the Portal bridge not working with OSMO, specifically mentions of "portal v2" and the removal of Osmosis from the UI. Users are frustrated and asking for fixes. There's a mention of needing to use the Cosmos tab and some workarounds like clearing cache or using different apps. Also, some messages talk about removing liquidity issues with Ledger and a fix not being available yet. Later, there's a part about Polaris and how it benefits OSMO holders through increased volume and fees. Someone mentions a thread on Discord for more info.

So the main topics here seem to be: Osmosis bridge issues with Portal, Portal v2 upgrade problems, removal of Osmosis from the Portal UI, user frustration and support requests, workarounds like using the Cosmos tab, Ledger-related liquidity removal issues, and the benefits of Polaris for OSMO holders. Maybe also the lack of communication from the team since they keep saying "soon" without updates.

I should make sure to capture all these points without repeating. Let me list them out concisely. Osmosis bridge connection problems, Portal v2 upgrade, Osmosis removed from Portal UI, user frustration, support requests, workaround steps (Cosmos tab, cache clearing), Ledger wallet issues, Polaris benefits for OSMO holders, delayed fixes, and lack of team communication. Also, the mention of a Discord thread for updates.

Wait, the user wants a comma-separated list. Let me check if all these are distinct topics. Maybe combine some. For example, Portal v2 upgrade and Osmosis removed from UI are related but separate points. The Polaris part is a different topic. The Ledger issue is another. So the list would be: Osmosis bridge connection issues, Portal v2 upgrade, Osmosis removed from Portal UI, user frustration, support requests, workaround steps (Cosmos tab/cache clearing), Ledger wallet liquidity removal problems, Polaris benefits for OSMO holders, delayed fixes, lack of team communication, and

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people discussing Osmosis, a blockchain platform. The task is to determine the overall sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The first message is from osmosis_statbot, which is a bot sharing a support link. That's neutral because it's just providing information. Then chetcvale13 says, "Thats good. Because they need to respect us!!!! HAHAHA." The "good" and the exclamation marks with HAHAHA might indicate a positive sentiment, but the context is a bit unclear. Maybe they're being sarcastic? Hmm, but the main words are positive, so I'll lean towards positive here.

Next, kychuli comments, "nah its frustrating. their discord is just full of 'wen osmo' lol." The word "frustrating" is clearly negative, so that's a negative sentiment. Then chetcvale13 again: "I hope not. They shouldn't have forgotten us in the first place. LOL." The "hope not" and "forgotten us" suggest dissatisfaction, so negative. 

kychuli again: "upgraded to 'portal v2' and its not an option at the moment, not sure why but not permanent." This seems like a complaint about a feature not working, so negative. chetcvale13 follows with "Hopefully they plan on fixing it or there is no reason to use OSMO to buy other chained coins." Expressing hope but pointing out a problem, so probably negative. 

Svansy says, "they removed osmosis." That's a direct negative statement. chetcvale13: "none of the portal connections work with OSMO." Another negative. WorkerBee_3 shares a link to an alternative, which is neutral as it's just providing a resource.

kychuli has a few messages: "and theres no fallback page to v1 that I can find" and "not sure what the problem was, didnt make it in to the v2 initial portal release lol" and "ive been trying to get them to update me on this for days, they just keep saying 'soon'." All these indicate frustration and issues, so negative. WorkerBee_3 again suggests another app, which is neutral.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. The user provided a conversation between various people discussing issues with Osmosis and some related platforms. Let me go through each message and pick out any actionable items or decisions.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's a general help message, so maybe not an action item but a resource. Then chetcvale13 and kychuli are talking about the Discord being full of "wen osmo" and frustration. Not actionable.

Next, kychuli mentions they upgraded to 'portal v2' and it's not an option. So maybe there's a decision here that portal v2 doesn't have a certain feature. Then chetcvale13 says they hope it's fixed. Not an action item yet.

Svansy says they removed Osmosis, and chetcvale13 says portal connections don't work with OSMO. WorkerBee_3 provides a link to portalbridge.com and another app. Those are resources but maybe not action items. 

kychuli mentions no fallback to v1 and that they've been asking for updates but only got "soon". That's a problem but not an action item. WorkerBee_3 suggests trying another app, which is a suggestion but not sure if it's an official action.

chetcvale13 says they can't send anything. Svansy talks about the UI issues and needing to use the Cosmos tab. Then WorkerBee_3 asks if they've cleared cache and refreshed. Chetcvale13 is trying that. So here, clearing cache and refreshing could be a next step someone is taking.

Earlier messages mention issues with removing liquidity via Ledger and needing CLI. GPKwee says you can only use CLI for Ledger users. So that's an action item for users with that issue: use CLI to remove liquidity.

Then there's a question about how Polaris benefits Osmo holders. Davidjgoosey explains that Polaris increases the funnel and targets a bigger market, and Osmosis remains the liquidity layer. That might be a decision or a next step in their strategy, but maybe not an explicit action item.

BasementNodes shares a thread link and says no word yet, trying to see if you can do something via daodao. User_
