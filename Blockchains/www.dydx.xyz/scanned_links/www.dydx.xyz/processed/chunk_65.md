h2: Legitimacy and Disclaimer

Cryptocurrency traders have seen dozens of ups and downs since Bitcoin (BTC) launched in 2009, but the overall trajectory of the market has been climbing. For the first time in history, BTC hit a staggering$1 trillion valuationin 2021, and the rest of the cryptocurrency industryswelled to nearly $3 trillionthat same year.Â

Whenever cryptocurrencies go on these tremendous upswings, it's common to hear people use phrases like "bullish sentiment" and "bull market"âbut what do bulls have to do with BTCâs prices?Â

Learning what a "bull market" helps traders figure out how other traders feel about the value of digital assets and make informed predictions about future price potential. Learn how to spot a crypto bull market and how long they typically last.Â

When financial analysts say an asset is in a bull market, they mean the value of an investment has continued to increase for at least a few months. The phrase "bull market" alludes to the way a bull lifts its horns to attack its prey or a daring toreador. During "bullish" periods, prices keep heading up with no end in sight. A "crypto bull run" means there's sustained upward price movement in the cryptocurrency market.Â

During bull markets, as the value of digital assets goes up, traders may feel a sense of euphoria, excitement, and optimism about the future. Because the general trend of a bull market is upward, traders typically see greater profits and have higher risk tolerance as they seek to maximize potential gains in emerging growth segments. Traders are also more likely to trade in smaller and more speculative cryptocurrencies during bull runs as they try to capitalize on potential profits in digital assets. Sometimes, the mania of a bull market leads people to make rash emotional decisions and "panic buy" cryptocurrencies to avoid the fear of missing out (or "FOMO").
