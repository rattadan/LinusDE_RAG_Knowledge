## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 49

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I'll provide a focused analysis of the specific section.

**Technical details:**
The current text chunk describes two technical documents:

1. City of Houston (2020) - "Pick-up and drop-off pilot for passenger cars." This document appears to be an official city report or announcement, detailing the implementation of pick-up and drop-off zones in Downtown Houston's Historic District.
2. Fagnant, D.J., Kockelman, K. (2015). No specific technical details are mentioned, but it seems to be a research paper or study that investigated various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles.

**Parameters and processes:**
The chunk discusses the following parameters and processes:

1. **Pick-up and drop-off zones:** The document explains the concept of pick-up and drop-off zones in urban areas, particularly in downtown historic districts.
2. **Implementation:** The city of Houston has launched a pilot program to implement these zones, with an expansion to a larger area.
3. **Data collection:** The authors mention that they used mesoscopic traffic flow models for agent-based simulation (De Souza et al., 2019) to simulate the behavior of passengers in the pick-up and drop-off zones.

**Context:**
The chunk is connected to the surrounding context through:

1. **Shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance:** The text mentions a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports on shared autonomous vehicles, including their impacts on urban transportation systems.
2. **Specific topics covered:** The references cover various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, such as congestion pricing, parking needs, consumer preferences, optimization techniques, effects on vehicle ownership, and the "peak car" phenomenon.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**
There are no explicit requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk. However, it appears that the authors are citing specific studies (e.g., De Souza et al., 2019) to support their arguments, which may have been published after the current text was written.

Overall, the chunk is providing technical information on a specific topic related to shared autonomous vehicles and their implementation in urban areas.
