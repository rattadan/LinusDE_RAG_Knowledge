**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're referring to the book "The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation MATSim" edited by Horni, A., Nagel, K., and Axhausen, K.W. published in 2016.

However, I couldn't find any information on an author named "Horni, A." The correct authors listed are Dr. Alina Horni, Dr. Klaus Nagel, and Prof. Kristian W. Axhausen.

This book seems to be a research publication or academic work, likely from the field of transportation modeling or agent-based simulation. MATSim is a software framework for simulating complex transport systems, and this book provides an overview of its capabilities and applications.

If you have any specific questions about the book or its contents, I'd be happy to try and assist you further!
