## Eureka - Chunk 43

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

For example, with Viem, we do the following:

TypeScript

Copy
import { createWalletClient, custom} from 'viem';
import * as chains from 'viem/chains';
import { SkipClient } from '@skip-go/client';

const
const skipClient = new SkipClient({
  getEVMSigner: async (chainID) => {
    const chain = extractChain({
  		chains: Object.values(chains),
  		id: parseInt(chainID)
    });
    const evmWalletClient = createWalletClient({
  		chain: chain,
  		transport: custom(window.ethereum!)
  	});
    return evmWalletClient;
  }
});
​
2. Request Route using SkipClient and get required chain
Next, request your route as normal:

TypeScript

Copy
const route = await skipClient.route({
  amountIn: "1000",
  sourceAssetDenom: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
  sourceAssetChainID: "1",
  destAssetDenom: "0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831",
  destAssetChainID: "42161",
  smartRelay: true,
  smartSwapOptions: {
    splitRoutes: true
  }
};

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk appears to be describing the technical details and processes involved in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, Go Fast, and their respective failure points.

Breaking down this chunk:

1. **Technical Details**: The code snippet imports necessary libraries and functions from various modules, including "viem" (a library for interacting with blockchain networks) and "custom" from the "@skip-go/client" module. It also defines a new class called `SkipClient`, which is used to interact with the Skip protocol. Additionally, it requests routes using the `route` method of the `SkipClient` instance.

2. **IBC**: The IBC protocol is described as having potential for timeouts or slippage during swaps, where tokens are sent back to their source chain if issues arise.

3. **Post-Swap Failures**: Similar rules apply to post-swapping scenarios, where tokens may end up on the wrong chain due to slippage or other errors.

4. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**: Axelar GMP is mentioned as having slow relaying from the protocol itself that can cause timeouts and slippage issues during swaps.

5. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**: The chunk highlights potential issues with Circle's attestation service, which can lead to funds being inaccessible if the service outage occurs.

6. **Hyperlane**: Hyperlane is described as being secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs), specifically mentioning that a multisig ISM is required for successful processing of smart relays and swaps.

7. **Go Fast**: The Go Fast protocol is discussed, including its timeout mechanisms and refund processes in case of failure or intent expiration issues during transactions within multi-tx sequences.

8. **Additional Insights**:
   - Short-term solutions proposed include adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API, implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API, and building better incentives for relayers.
   - Long-term recommendations include user education on potential failure points, risk management strategies, and developer best practices to mitigate risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

9. **Recommendations**:
   - The text concludes by suggesting that developers and users should be aware of these failure points and take steps to prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

This chunk provides detailed technical insights into various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, including their potential failure points and how they can be mitigated or addressed in a controlled manner.
