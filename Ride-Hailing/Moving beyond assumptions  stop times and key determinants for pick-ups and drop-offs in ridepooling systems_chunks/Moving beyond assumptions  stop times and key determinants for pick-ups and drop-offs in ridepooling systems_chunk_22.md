**Original Text:**

To capture a diverse
set of data, we conducted observations on various days of the week, including both typical weekdays and weekends, as well as during different times of the day, such as morning,
evening, and nighttime periods. For each PUDO event, we collected multiple data points:
the number of passengers boarding and alighting, the type of stop location (virtual or
public transit), the presence of bulky luggage (e.g. strollers or bicycles), and passenger age
estimates categorised into age ranges. All data collection and time measurements were consistently carried out by the same
observer to maintain uniformity in the observations. The observations were conducted passively, with no conversations held with passengers, and no personal data were recorded to
ensure utmost privacy. Data pre-processing
In the pre-processing phase, our objective was to ensure the integrity of the data for our
analysis. This involved a thorough review and cleaning of the collected data.
