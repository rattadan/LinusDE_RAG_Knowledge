### Document Overview  
The content outlines Noble's announcements about their Euro-backed stablecoin EURe, the launch of CCTP to enable USDC access on Cosmos, and the transition of USDC to Celestia rollups, alongside community-related actions like FRNZ token redemption.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Euro-backed stablecoins**: EURe is the first Euro-backed stablecoin in the $30 billion IBC-enabled blockchain ecosystem.  
- **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)**: Enables cross-chain communication and asset transfers between blockchains.  
- **USDC (USD Stablecoin)**: A decentralized, fiat-backed stablecoin.  
- **Native USDC**: USDC issued directly on a blockchain (e.g., Noble) without intermediaries, offering unique features like instant liquidity.  
- **Celestia rollups**: A layer-2 solution for the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling efficient transaction processing and scalability.  
- **Bridged USDC**: USDC issued on other blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) through bridges, requiring additional steps for access.  

### Implementation Details  
- **EURe**: A Euro-backed stablecoin built on IBC-enabled blockchains, enabling cross-chain transfers and liquidity.  
- **CCTP (Cosmos Token Program)**: A token program enabling seamless access to USDC on Cosmos, enhancing user experience (UX) and liquidity.  
- **Native USDC**: Issued directly on the Noble blockchain, offering immediate access to assets without intermediaries.  
- **Celestia Rollups**: Noble plans to bring native USDC to Celestia rollups, leveraging the Cosmos ecosystem’s scalability and efficiency.  
- **FRNZ Redemption**: Community-driven token distribution, allowing users to redeem FRNZ tokens for rewards.  

### Related Topics
