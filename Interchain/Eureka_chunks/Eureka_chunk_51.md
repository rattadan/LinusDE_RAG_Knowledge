## Eureka - Chunk 51

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

There are similar failure modes for Axelar as there are for IBC:

Swap failures
What: Axelar GMP takes user assets from an EVM chain to the swap chain. The swap can still fail at this point due to a timeout or slippage. Outcome / What to Expect: The user receives the Axelar-transferred token on the chain where the swap was supposed to take place at their recovery address. (Note this is different from the IBC swap failure case where the user receives the swap token back on the source chain)
Common failure sources:
Slow relaying from Axelar causes a timeout, and the swap is not attempted. Slippage (the amount out for the swap turns out to be less than the user’s specified minimum, i.e. their slippage exceeds their tolerance)
Post-swap failures
Once the swap is executed, Axelar is no longer involved, and the same rules that apply to IBC post-swap failures apply here, so the Post-swap failures section above applies. ​
CCTP Failures
Routes that use CCTP transfers rely on Circle to produce attestations.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk describes potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), and Hyperlane.

**Technical Details:**

1. **Timeout mechanisms:** The section mentions that timeout mechanisms are used to prevent users from losing funds due to the failed execution of a transaction.
2. **Slippage issues:** Slippage is also mentioned as a potential issue, where the amount out for a swap exceeds the user's tolerance.
3. **Multisig ISM (Interchain Security Modules):** The section discusses how multisig ISMs are used to secure transactions and prevent funds from being inaccessible on both chains.

**Contextual Connection:**

The current text chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing an overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. It also connects to previous sections that discussed specific protocols, such as Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol) and Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP).

**Requirements and Conditions:**

1. **User education:** The section recommends informing users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk management:** The section advises developers to implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

Overall, this text chunk provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, highlighting technical details, connections to previous sections, and recommendations for user education and risk management.
