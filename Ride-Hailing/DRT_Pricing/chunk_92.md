**LLM Contextual Output:**

The article "Autonomous driving: The impact of vehicle automation on mobility behaviour" by Ziemke, Kaddoura, Nagel, et al., published in the journal Procedia Computer Science, explores the effects of autonomous driving on mobility behavior.

The authors conducted a multimodal agent-based transport simulation scenario based on synthetic demand modeling and open data. This allowed them to analyze how autonomous vehicles (AVs) would influence transportation behavior.

Here are some key findings:

1. **Increased usage**: AVs were found to lead to an increase in travel time, as drivers had to adjust their schedules to accommodate the new driving style.
2. **Shift to non-traditional modes of transport**: The simulation showed that people would increasingly use alternative modes of transport, such as cycling or walking, rather than relying on cars alone.
3. **Reduced reliance on public transportation**: As AVs became more common, public transportation usage decreased, leading to a shift towards using personal vehicles for shorter trips.
4. **Increased accessibility**: AVs were found to increase access to mobility services, particularly for older adults and people with disabilities, by providing door-to-door transport options.

The authors conclude that autonomous driving will have significant impacts on mobility behavior, requiring changes in individual habits, transportation systems, and urban planning strategies. The study highlights the need for a multimodal approach to address these effects, integrating different modes of transport into a seamless system.
