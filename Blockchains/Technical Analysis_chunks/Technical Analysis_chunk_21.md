**Original Text:**

A “faster” Moving Average like the WMA or EMA will give a benefit in short-term trading. For long-term trading, an SMA will be smoother and more ideal. The differences between the SMA, WMA, and EMA aren’t very significant at first sight but they do give different signals on the chart. Let’s look at what the charts tell us now that we have explained the different types of Moving Averages. SMA_EMA_WMA

The SMA is blue, the WMA is orange, and the EMA is purple. In this example you can see the SMA is more flat and slow, the WMA is fast and closer to the price, and the EMA is in between both. Use Signals and PRO Trading Bot Strategies
