## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 19

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

**Original Text:**

as the overview of the resulting stop locations in figure 3.3 demonstrates. The average
walking distance to a stop is 240 m, whereas in the base case scenario, the average walking distance is 585m to reach
a transit stop. Simulations for both the door-to-door and the stop-based scheme are run with a varying fleet size between 200 and
600 vehicles. A capacity of eight passengers per vehicle is assumed. For further analysis, only those simulation runs
are evaluated where a certain service rate is reached and the fleet utilization is sufficient. 3.4. Quality of service and economic assessment
To assess the quality of these services, a set of service criteria need to be defined. On the passengers side, these
include the waiting times for vehicles and total travel times. In order to find a wide acceptance, the service needs to be
as reliable as schedule based public transport. This mainly means that the rate of trips where the target service criteria
are met, needs to be high.

	+ Operational costs: daily operational cost, travel times
	+ Travel times and costs comparison between stop-based and door-to-door systems

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Providing a technical explanation of the simulation approach used in the study.
* Connecting it to the broader discussion on the potential impact of DRT systems on traditional public transport operations.

The specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned include:

* The need for a set of service criteria to be defined (quality of service and economic assessment) for evaluating the services provided by both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
* The requirement for a high rate of trips meeting certain service criteria to ensure reliability.

Overall, this chunk is providing technical details on how the simulation approach was used in the study, which is essential for understanding the methodology behind the research.
