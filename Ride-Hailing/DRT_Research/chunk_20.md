The inherent tradeoff between the cost and quality of the DRT service necessitates holding a balance between the agency and user costs. The optimal balance between the operation cost and quality of the service can be determined by minimizing the total cost for the agency and users. In this objective function, the VOT that we consider for the users reflects the importance of the quality of the service for users relative to the cost of operations. The monetary operating cost for the agency can be

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're discussing Demand Response (DRT) systems and their optimization. To summarize:

The main point here is that when demand in a system exceeds its operating capacity, users are left with higher delay, reduced quality of service, and other inefficiencies due to inadequate capacity. 

To address this issue, the focus shifts to finding an optimal balance between the costs associated with maintaining the existing capacity (agency costs) and improving the quality of the Demand Response Time (DRT) service. This balance is typically achieved by minimizing the total cost for both the agency and users.

One key consideration in determining this balance is the Value of Time (VOT), which represents how much the quality of the DRT service matters to users relative to the cost of operations. By prioritizing VOT, agencies can better understand the importance of maintaining adequate capacity and optimizing their costs accordingly.

To further discuss Demand Response systems, it's worth noting that one underlying assumption is that demand can be distributed uniformly across a peak period. This suggests that managing demand during peak periods is crucial for minimizing the number of requests awaiting service in non-peak periods.
