## Chunk 28

**Original Text:**

Finally, we will prioritize the ongoing maintenance and
development of the technical components of the nRide application to ensure a seamless user experience. Key Partnerships
We believe in the importance of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and the numerous benefits they offer,
including transparency, efficiency, and ownership. These values are reflected in our foundational
components, which are built on decentralized networks and are supported by key partners. Our partnership with Juno network is integral to the nRide protocol, as we leverage their decentralized,
public, permissionless network to power our escrow, registry, and token smart contracts. These
components are vital to nRide and enable us to deliver a secure and trustworthy experience to our users.
