## Chunk 19

**Original Text:**

ProposalCancellation
Drivers can send a "ProposalCancellation" to the passenger before their proposal is accepted. This cancellation signifies that the driverâ€™s proposal is no longer valid, for example if the driver is no longer able to fulfill
the ride request or if the passenger has already chosen a different driver. Sending a ProposalCancellation allows drivers to inform the passenger that they are no longer able to fulfill
the ride request, which can help to prevent confusion and ensure that the passenger is able to quickly find
another driver to fulfill the request. ProposalCancellation {
String id;
String source;
String proposalID;
}

2.2.5. Acceptance
When a passenger broadcasts a ride request, they may receive multiple proposals from nearby drivers.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're proposing an improvement to the existing system for handling ride requests and cancellations. Here's a potential solution based on your description:

**Proposal Cancellation Model**

To address the "ProposalCancellation" functionality, we can introduce a new model that includes the following components:

* `Proposal` (a class representing a proposal)
* `ProposalID` (a unique identifier for each proposal)
* `Driver` (a class representing a driver, with properties like `id`, `source`, and `proposal`)
