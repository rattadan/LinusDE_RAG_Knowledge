## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 38

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Although queues forming because of aggregating
pickup trips is not modeled into POLARIS on the congestible network yet, this queue-forming
and curb-encroaching behavior can be seen from average trip clustering at different times of day. Figure 7 compares the 15-min traveler arrivals at PUDOs in the 5x and 25x trip density scenarios
when PUDO spacing was 0.25 mi. With AVOs ranging 1.2-1.6 per SAV, at least 150 SAVs
would be arriving at the PUDOs in the peak 15-min time period. Off-road infrastructure to
sustain about 10 SAVs arriving every minute at PUDO zones does not currently exist but MPOs
need to be planning for such situations in a future of SAVs. These SAVs taking up curb space
may outweigh congestion savings from eVMT reduction if they are not able to leave the main
roadway quickly. PUDO spacing greater than or equal to 0.5 mi may create bottlenecks. Careful
PUDO location planning will be required for current demand and dedicated off-road
infrastructure will be a necessity going forward.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text describes the following technical details, parameters, or processes:

1. **Trip density scenarios**: The author mentions different trip density scenarios (5x and 25x) to illustrate how the number of trips affects congestion.
2. **AVOs (Autonomous Vehicle Ownerships)**: The author states that at least 150 SAVs (Self-Autonomous Vehicles) would be arriving at PUDO zones in a peak 15-min time period, using AVO ranges of 1.2-1.6 per SAV.
3. **SAVs (Self-Autonomous Vehicles)**: The author mentions SAVs as the vehicles driving autonomous vehicles, with each vehicle requiring dedicated off-road infrastructure.

This chunk connects to and builds upon the surrounding context in several ways:

* It provides specific technical details on trip density scenarios, AVOs, and SAVs, which are mentioned earlier in the text.
* The mention of congestible networks (POLARIS) and average trip clustering at different times of day serves as a backdrop for discussing congestion-related issues with autonomous vehicles.
* The discussion of peak traffic periods (15-min time period) and queue formation due to aggregating pickup trips reinforces the context of shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance.

The specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk are:

* **Current demand**: The author highlights the need for careful PUDO location planning to accommodate current demand.
* **Dedicated off-road infrastructure**: The mention of dedicated off-road infrastructure is a requirement going forward, as SAVs may not be able to leave main roadways quickly if they take up curb space.
