I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

In addition to the main
experiments, we also study the influence of minor factors like the
temporal and spatial request distribution, the number of parking lots,
and the necessity of quick responses. specification, the best strategy per setting (row) is shown in italic
typeface. In addition, we compare the results of the two specifications
all/non-serving vehicles to determine which strategy is best when vehicle
availability is part of the strategy. In this comparison, the absolute best
strategy per setting is given in bold typeface. The results show that the nearest strategy outperforms the matching
approaches for fleets with low utilization (ùê∑ùëÜùëÖ = 40). This is caused by
the decision-delay of the matching approaches. Due to the assignment
interval ùõøùëÄ , actions are not taken immediately. In low-utilized fleets,
the benefit of the matching is lower than the time lost waiting for
the next matching epoch. This problem further increases with longer
matching intervals.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Processes:**

1. The technical details mentioned in this chunk relate to dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems. Specifically, they cover simulation platforms (e.g., DIMACS Center for Discrete Mathematics), methodologies (e.g., deep learning approaches), and the evaluation of different strategies.

2. The processes described involve comparing results between two specifications: the main experiment and an alternative specification with better performance. This comparison is aimed at identifying the best strategy per setting, which is represented in italic typeface.

3. The process also involves evaluating the impact of various factors on the system's performance, including:
    * Temporal request distribution
    * Spatial request distribution
    * Number of parking lots
    * Vehicle availability

**Contextual Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing more technical details about the methodologies used for simulation (spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network) and deep learning approaches.
2. Introducing new factors that affect system performance, such as vehicle availability and temporal request distribution.
3. Specifying a comparison between two alternative strategies to identify the best approach per setting.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. The condition for evaluating different strategies is that "vehicle availability is part of the strategy", implying that some level of availability is required for dynamic dispatch.

2. The constraint mentioned is related to the performance of fleets with low utilization (DSR = 40), where the decision-delay of matching approaches causes a negative impact on system performance due to delayed responses.
