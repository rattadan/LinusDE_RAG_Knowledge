## Chunk 51

**Original Text:**

Therefore, the escrow mechanism discourages bots from engaging in this type of behavior, as it imposes a financial penalty

-9on parties that do not fulfill their commitments. What happens when both parties turn up at the pickup point, and one of the users receives the
other’s secret, but doesn’t share their own secret (maliciously or for technical reasons)? This corresponds to "Approve(A, s_b) AND Cancel(B)", or the symmetrical state, and would result in an
unfair loss for the person who shared their secret. The exchange of secrets happens at pickup and in person,
in the physical realm, so at that stage, refusing to share one’s secret is akin to running away without paying
after a regular Taxi ride. nRide users will just have to trust each other not to do that.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The escrow mechanism serves as a safeguard to prevent both parties from being disadvantaged in the event of a breach of confidentiality. In this scenario, if one party tries to share their secret with the other while holding onto theirs, the exchange is cancelled, and neither user loses any money or information. This mechanism helps maintain trust and ensures that both parties feel protected.
