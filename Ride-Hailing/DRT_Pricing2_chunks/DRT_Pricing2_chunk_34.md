## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 34

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

We consider this optional variation only
in settings without a maximum waiting time restriction, as we
have to ensure that all ùëõ requests will actually be matched. available vehicles. They assume that open requests will be queued
in a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) fashion until they are answered. In
this case, the next assignment will happen whenever the next vehicle
becomes available for assignment. However, assigning this vehicle to
the longest-waiting customer will most likely lead to bad assignments in
terms of distance or travel time. To prevent this, they propose to switch
from request-based to vehicle-based assignments and assign the nearest
request to the first available vehicle. With that, the first-come-firstserve principle is disregarded (which can lead to fairness concerns),
but the efficiency of the fleet is increased due to better assignments. This proves to be successful because efficiency is key in times of undersupply. Nevertheless, we do not consider this strategy in our study.
