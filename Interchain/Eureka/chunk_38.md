## Chunk 38

**Original Text:**

Unlike CW20s, native tokens are directly compatible with ICS20 and IBC modules. One can send a native token to another chain over a transfer channel just using a MsgTransfer — no conversion contracts or anything of the sort required. The downside of native tokens is that they’re permissioned and deeply ingrained into the chain’s state machine. As a result, issuing a new native token requires a chain upgrade. Issuing a CW20 on the other hand, only requires deploying a new contract (just a transaction).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

You're discussing the differences between native tokens and centralized exchange of value (CEX) tokens in various blockchain networks.

Yes, that's correct. Native tokens are specifically designed to be compatible with the underlying blockchain network, such as ICS20 and IBC modules, without the need for conversion contracts or additional infrastructure. This means that users can send native tokens directly from one chain to another using a transfer message (MsgTransfer) without any intermediate steps.

On the other hand, Centralized Exchange of Value (CEX) tokens require a different approach, as they are often issued by centralized exchanges and require permissioning mechanisms, which can be restrictive and may not be compatible with all blockchain networks. Issuing a new CEX token also typically requires an upgrade to the underlying blockchain network.

It's worth noting that native tokens have some unique characteristics that make them more suitable for certain use cases, such as high-speed transactions and direct compatibility with the underlying blockchain network. However, this also means that they may require more maintenance and updates to ensure their continued compatibility and security.

Do you have any specific questions or use cases in mind where native tokens might be a good fit, or are there any other aspects of native tokens you'd like to discuss?
