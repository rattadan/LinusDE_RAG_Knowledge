In this objective function, the VOT that we consider for the users reflects the importance of the quality of the service for users relative to the cost of operations. The monetary operating cost for the agency can be 
Demand management strategies
As explained in the previous section, the underlying assumption in optimizing the number of requests awaiting service in the peak period is that that demand can be distributed uniformly across the period. However, the distribution of the demand in the equilibrium condition will naturally tend to be stepwise in the peak period, which is the cumulative result of the rational behavior of the individual users minimizing their own costs. Accordingly, demand management strategies that can make the
Numerical example
To provide a numerical illustration of this problem, in this section we employ the proposed analytical model to optimize different operating strategies for a DRT service in different optimization scenarios. This DRT system is assumed to provide a curb-to-curb service for its users in an area of 
 mi2 with a network travel parameter of 
, and a fixed peak demand of 
 requests.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that you haven't provided the objective function itself, but rather a general description of the problem. However, I can provide a sample objective function based on your description:

Let's say we have a discrete-time random walk (DRT) system with a network travel parameter λ and a fixed peak demand of Q = 100 requests.

The VOT (Value-Of-Treatment) that reflects the importance of the quality of service for users relative to the cost of operations can be represented as:

Minimize ∑[u_i(t)] \* [cost(t) - v_i(t)],

where u_i(t) is the utility or satisfaction level of user i at time t, v_i(t) is the VOT for user i, and [ ] denotes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a uniform random variable.

The cost function c(t) can be modeled as:

c(t) = λ \* ∑[d_i(t) - μ],

where d_i(t) is the distance traveled by user i at time t, and μ is the mean distance to travel.

To optimize different operating strategies for the DRT service, we would need to incorporate this objective function into an optimization framework. The specifics of the optimization algorithm, such as the numerical example provided, are not clear without further context or details about how the VOT is calculated and incorporated into the model.
