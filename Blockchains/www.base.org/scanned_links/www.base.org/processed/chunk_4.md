### Document Overview  
This content outlines Base's vision to build an open financial system on the blockchain, emphasizing onchain development, phased growth, and community collaboration to scale securely and efficiently.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Onchain Platform**: Base's focus on decentralized, open-source blockchain infrastructure.  
- **L2 Rollups (EIP4844)**: Optimism's layer 2 solution for scaling Ethereum.  
- **Phased Development**: Four stages (1M, 10M, 100M, 1B+ users) to build a global financial ecosystem.  
- **Open Source & Community Collaboration**: Emphasis on free, accessible development and collective effort for scalability.  
- **Secure, Safe, Easy-to-Use**: Core goals for the platform's usability and reliability.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Scaling Strategy**: Uses Optimism (EIP4844) to enable Ethereum-based L2 rollups for faster transactions.  
- **Phased Roadmap**:  
  - **Phase 1**: Develop the protocol (1M users).  
  - **Phase 2**: Build a digital currency exchange (10M users).  
  - **Phase 3**: Create a mass-market interface for apps (100M users).  
  - **Phase 4**: Launch an open financial system (1B+ users).  
- **Community Engagement**: "All hands on deck" to ensure collaborative scaling and security.  

### Related Topics  
- **EIP4844**: Technical specification for Optimism's L2 rollup.  
- **Open Financial System**: Connection to broader blockchain goals (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).  
- **Layer 2 Solutions**: Reference to scalability strategies in Ethereum and other networks.

We started by doing this on Ethereum, drivingEIP4844with Optimism to enable L2 rollups to scale.But we don't believe that's enough, so here we are.

Base is our all in commitment to onchain.

We believe that the onchain platform is the most important builder platform since the internet (online). We believe that the onchain platform should be open source, free to use, and globally available. And we believe that in order to make it really work, we need all hands on deck, working together to scale in a secure, safe, easy-to-use way.

From the beginning,our secret master planhas been clear and consistent: create an open financial system that increases economic freedom globally by moving deliberately through four phases.

New protocols (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) were invented and people began to tinker with them. Open source communities developed around each protocol and early adopters began experimenting with how they could be used.

Coinbase started here. Investment or speculation is a bootstrapping mechanism for a payment network (in other words, it is thesingle-player modeof digital currency). And the creation of safe and easy to use exchanges served as abridgefor people to get their local currency into and out of digital currency.
