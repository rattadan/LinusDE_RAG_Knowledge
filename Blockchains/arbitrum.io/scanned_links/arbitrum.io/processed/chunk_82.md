## Source Context
*From: https://arbitrum.io/*

### Document Overview  
This content outlines the arbitration agreement’s rules for fee payment, confidentiality, and severability, emphasizing how disputes are managed through arbitration under the AAA Rules.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Arbitration Fees**: Defined as costs for filing, administration, and arbitrator fees, with payment conditions based on the value of the relief sought.  
- **Confidentiality**: Prohibits disclosure of arbitration proceedings, rulings, or decisions to protect parties’ interests.  
- **Severability**: Allows the arbitration agreement to remain enforceable if a term is found invalid, replacing it with a valid, enforceable alternative.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Fee Payment Rules**:  
  - Offchain Labs pays arbitration fees if the relief value is $75,000 or less, or if the arbitrator determines a party is economically unable to pay.  
  - If arbitration costs are deemed prohibitive compared to litigation, Offchain Labs covers as much of the fees as the arbitrator deems necessary.  
- **Severability Clause**: Specifies that invalid terms are replaced with equivalent, enforceable provisions to preserve the agreement’s validity.  
- **AAA Rules**: Governs arbitration fees and attorney’s fees, ensuring standardized procedures for dispute resolution.  

### Related Topics  
- **AAA Rules**: The document references the AAA Rules for arbitration fee governance, indicating alignment with broader arbitration frameworks.  
- **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**: Confidentiality provisions imply connections to legal NDAs, though not explicitly detailed in the text.  
- **Legal Terms**: The severability clause ties to broader legal principles of contract law, such as "force majeure" or "restitution of agreements."

the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
- Costs of ArbitrationPayment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the Arbitration Fees) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Offchain Labs will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Offchain Labs will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Offchain Labs will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
- ConfidentialityAll aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
- SeverabilityIf a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified.
