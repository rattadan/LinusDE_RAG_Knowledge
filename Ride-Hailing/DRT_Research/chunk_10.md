## Chunk 10

**Original Text:**

Second, ADA requires that complementary paratransit for people with disability schedule a pick up within one hour of the initial requested pick-up time, so very large peaks in demand give operators no choice but to run more vehicles and employ more drivers. This paper presents a model and optimization approach for DRT service that is used to minimize the total cost to the agency and users combined. An analytical model for DRT systems based on Rahimi et al. (2014) and Daganzo (1978) is employed to approximate the components of the operating cost of the DRT system: fleet size, total vehicle hours traveled (VHT), and total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network. Given the service area of the DRT system, these components of the agency cost can be approximated as functions of the number of waiting passengers that have requested service and the maximum rate that operators can serve passengers per time (i.e., operating capacity).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing the Designated Rapid Transit (DRT) service, which provides public transportation to individuals with disabilities. Here's a breakdown of your points:

* You mention that ADA regulations require DRT services to schedule pickups within one hour of initial requests, leading operators to increase their fleet size and employ more drivers to manage peak demand.
* Your paper presents a model and optimization approach for DRT service to minimize total costs to the agency and users. This involves an analytical model based on Rahimi et al. (2014) and Daganzo (1978), which estimates the components of operating costs, including:
  + Fleet size
  + Total vehicle hours traveled (VHT)
  + Total vehicle miles traveled (VMT)

These costs are typically influenced by factors such as waiting passenger numbers, maximum operating capacity, and service area boundaries.

To clarify, you're seeking information on how to optimize DRT services under the constraints of ADA regulations and the analytical models used in transportation planning. Is there a specific aspect of this optimization process or a particular model you'd like more information on?
