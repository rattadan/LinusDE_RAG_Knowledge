## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on the key points and decisions. Let me start by looking at each tweet from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, the latest tweet at 18:56 mentions wanting more news from Fetch.ai and ends with "All power to the AI." So the key point here is their interest in getting updates from Fetch.ai, highlighting AI's importance.

Then at 18:55, there's an airdrop announcement from SubQueryNetwork to support JunoNetwork. Airdrops are significant because they often relate to token distribution or community support, so that's a decision point.

At 18:54, they talk about a new video from Cryptocito regarding Osmosiszone. That's promoting content related to another project, which shows collaboration or support.

Earlier at 18:53, SubQueryNetwork is venturing into Cosmos and JunoNetwork. This indicates expansion or partnership decisions.

At 18:52, they mention cheqd_io as a cool project, which is an endorsement but maybe not a major decision.

At 18:50, Covalent_HQ and EvmosOrg are friends, suggesting a collaboration or partnership between these two.

The first tweet at 18:26 is the Cosmos Weekly News, asking for comments on which projects people want to see and events they're excited about. It lists several tokens like ATOM, AXL, etc., which are part of the Cosmos ecosystem. The hashtag #IBCgang refers to the Inter-Blockchain Communication, so maybe they're promoting community engagement around IBC-related projects.

Putting this together, the main points are the Cosmos Ecosystem promoting various collaborations (SubQueryNetwork with Juno, Covalent and EvmosOrg), an airdrop by SubQueryNetwork, a video from Cryptocito about Osmosis, endorsements of projects like cheqd_io, and community engagement through their weekly news asking for feedback on projects and events. The focus is on partnerships, community involvement, and highlighting specific projects within the Cosmos network.

I should structure the summary to mention each key event, the collaborations, airdrop, content promotion, and the community interaction. Also note the emphasis on AI with Fetch.ai and the listed tokens. Keep it concise, maybe bullet points or a short paragraph. Avoid the permalinks and just focus on the actions and announcements

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand the structure of the text. It looks like a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, each mentioning different projects or events.

Starting with the first tweet: "We also want more news from @Fetch_ai All power to the AI". The main topic here seems to be Fetch.ai and AI. Next, "Airdrop from @SubQueryNetwork to support @JunoNetwork" mentions SubQueryNetwork, Airdrop, and JunoNetwork. The third tweet is about a new video from @Cryptocito regarding @osmosiszone, so those are the topics. Then there's another tweet where SubQueryNetwork ventures into Cosmos and JunoNetwork again, so those three. 

Another tweet praises @cheqd_io as a cool project, so cheqd_io. Then Covalent_HQ and EvmosOrg are friends, so those two. The last long tweet is the Cosmos Weekly News, mentions several hashtags like #IBCgang, projects like ATOM, AXL, AKT, FET, UMEE, JUNO, EVMOS, LIKE, HUAHUA, STARS, and also asks for comments. But the main topics here are Cosmos Weekly News, IBCgang, and the listed projects. 

Wait, but should I include all the $-prefixed tokens? The user might want the actual project names without the $ symbol. So ATOM is Cosmos, AXL is Axelar, AKT is Akash Network, FET is Fetch.ai, UMEE is Umee, JUNO is JunoNetwork, EVMOS is EvmosOrg, LIKE is LikeCoin, HUAHUA is Chihuahua Chain, STARS is Stargaze. But maybe the user just wants the handles or the ticker symbols? The original text uses both. The instruction says "main topics," so probably the project names and key terms. Also, "IBCgang" is a hashtag, so that's a topic. The weekly news itself is a topic. 

I should list each unique project mentioned, the airdrop, AI, video, and the hashtag. Make sure not to repeat JunoNetwork and EvmosOrg. Also, cheqd_io is mentioned once. The tokens like $ATOM might correspond

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- https (34 mentions)
- twitter (32 mentions)
- com (32 mentions)
- cosmosecosystem (28 mentions)
- status (14 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral.

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. The first one says, "We also want more news from Fetch.ai. All power to the AI." The mention of wanting more news from a specific project and the phrase "All power to the AI" sounds enthusiastic. That's probably positive.

Next, the second tweet mentions an airdrop from SubQueryNetwork supporting JunoNetwork. Airdrops are usually seen as positive in the crypto community because they can indicate growth or rewards for participants. So that's another positive.

Third tweet is about a new video from Cryptocito regarding Osmosiszone. Promoting a video isn't inherently positive or negative, but the context here seems neutral unless there's an implied endorsement. However, since it's part of their regular updates, maybe neutral.

The fourth tweet states SubQueryNetwork ventures into Cosmos and JunoNetwork. Expanding partnerships or ventures are generally positive as they suggest collaboration and growth. Positive here.

Fifth tweet calls cheqd_io a "cool project!" which is clearly positive with the exclamation mark adding emphasis.

Sixth tweet mentions Covalent_HQ and EvmosOrg being friends. Friendly relations between projects are positive, indicating good community and partnerships.

The seventh tweet is a weekly news update encouraging retweets and asking for community input. The use of emojis like üî• and phrases like "show your support" and "spreading the word" are positive, promoting engagement and community involvement.

Lastly, there's a link from JLiBercrypto. Since it's just a link without any text, it's hard to judge sentiment. But maybe the context of the previous tweets affects this? However, without content, I should treat it as neutral.

Now, tallying them up: most tweets are positive (5), one is neutral (the video tweet), and the link is neutral. The overall sentiment would be positive because the majority express enthusiasm, support, and collaboration. Even though one is neutral, the rest are clearly positive, leading the overall tone to be positive.
</think>

The sentiment of the provided text is **positive**.  

### Breakdown:  
1. **Enthusiastic endorsements**: Phrases like "All power to the AI," "cool project!,"

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and want me to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps from the text. 

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first few tweets are mentions of other projects like Fetch.ai, SubQueryNetwork supporting JunoNetwork, a new video from Cryptocito about Osmosiszone, SubQueryNetwork venturing into Cosmos and JunoNetwork, a shoutout to cheqd_io, and Covalent_HQ and EvmosOrg being friends. These seem to be announcements or positive mentions but not sure if there are specific actions here.

Then the last tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem before the user's message is asking for comments with #IBCgang projects people want to see and events they're excited about. They include several hashtags and a link. The user JLiBercrypto's message is just a link. 

So action items might be the request for followers to comment with their suggestions. The next steps could be the team following up on those comments. The other tweets are just updates but don't have explicit actions. The user might want to list the request for comments as an action item and maybe the team's intention to spread the word. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other actions. The other tweets are just informational, so the main action is in the last one. Decisions here could be the Cosmos Ecosystem team deciding to feature certain projects based on feedback. Next steps would be engaging with the community to gather input. 

I should structure this clearly, listing the action items and next steps based on the tweets. The user probably wants a concise summary without the extra details of each tweet. Let me check again to confirm that there's no other action items elsewhere. Yep, the rest are just announcements. So the key points are the request for community input and the potential follow-up actions.
</think>

**Extracted Action Items, Decisions, or Next Steps:**  
1. **Community Engagement Request**:  
   - The Cosmos Ecosystem team invited followers to comment with **#IBCgang projects** they want featured or events they are excited about (e.g., $ATOM, $AXL, $AKT, $FET, $UMEE, $JUNO, $EVMOS, $LIKE, $HUAHUA, $ST
