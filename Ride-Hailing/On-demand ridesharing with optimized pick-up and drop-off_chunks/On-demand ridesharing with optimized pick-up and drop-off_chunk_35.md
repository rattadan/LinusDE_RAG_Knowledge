**Original Text:**

(1)), either waiting for it to arrive or riding it; note that the
resulting waiting and in-vehicle times still need to respect the bounds given by Eqs. (2) and (3). The third term (Eq. (7)) represents the
additional operating costs (cO in Eq. (1)), caused by the increase in the time-length of the vehicle’s route L(Sv ). We will say that cost(τ,
v) = ∞ when this is an infeasible assignment. Eqs. (5)–(7) do not include operators’ capital costs, because the optimization process is performed for a fixed fleet of vehicles. This
is not a minor thing, because operators might be strongly favored by allowing walks if the fleet was also optimized, so our results will
likely underestimate the optimal amount of walking. Fleet sizing can be faced by trying different fleets to find the Pareto curves
between capital costs and the other costs, or by using analytical approximated functions and giving weights to each component of the
cost function.
