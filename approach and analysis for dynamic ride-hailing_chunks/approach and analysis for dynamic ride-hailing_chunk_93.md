**Original Text:**

If uniformly distributed request times are used, the service rate significantly increases since requests are more equally distributed over the
whole planning horizon, thus reducing the magnitude of undersupply in
former rush hours. Accordingly, this increase is larger for settings with
highly utilized fleets. Likewise, the benefit of repositioning increases in
these scenarios. Do some or all repositioning strategies favor customers in certain parts of the service area? We analyze the average service rates
and waiting times for different parts of the service area. All repositioning strategies lead to higher service quality in areas of high demand. There are no significant differences in the magnitude of this effect
depending on the strategy used. The suspected reason for this effect
is that, due to higher demand, more vehicles are sent to these areas,
thus involuntarily exploiting economies of scale.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining how dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies can benefit ride-hailing systems by optimizing service rates and reducing waiting times in high-demand areas.

Here's a focused analysis:

1. **Technical details and parameters**: The chunk discusses the concept of undersupply, which occurs when there are not enough vehicles to meet demand during peak hours. This is mitigated by repositioning strategies, where additional vehicles are sent to areas with high demand.
2. **Contextual connection**: The text refers to various references on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, highlighting the importance of understanding these topics within their respective research contexts (simulation, modeling, etc.).
3. **Requirements and conditions**: The chunk assumes that uniform distribution of request times is being used, which implies that a reliable and efficient routing system is necessary to manage demand fluctuations.

The text builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Providing an overview of dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies as methods for optimizing ride-hailing systems
* Highlighting the importance of understanding these concepts within their respective research contexts
* Offering evidence from specific references on the effectiveness of these strategies in improving service rates and waiting times

The specific requirements mentioned include:

* The need for a reliable and efficient routing system to manage demand fluctuations
* The significance of dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies in optimizing ride-hailing systems
