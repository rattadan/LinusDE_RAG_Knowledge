### Document Overview  
This content highlights Osmosis as the dominant DeFi platform in the Cosmos ecosystem, emphasizing its role as an interchain app store, integration with multiple blockchains, and its technical features like EIP 1559 and the grant program.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Layer-1 Blockchain Ecosystem**: Osmosis is a standalone blockchain with its own network and infrastructure.  
- **Interchain App Store**: Osmosis enables cross-chain DeFi applications (e.g., Milk Tia) to operate across multiple blockchains.  
- **EIP 1559**: A layer-2 optimization for Ethereum that Osmosis integrates to improve transaction fees and governance.  
- **Grant Program**: A funding initiative supporting long-term value-additive projects for Osmosis.

- **UI/UX**: The platform is praised for its visually appealing and user-friendly interface.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Integration with Blockchains**: Osmosis connects to over 50 blockchains (e.g., Cosmos, dYdX, Injective) and is expanding to more.  
- **EIP 1559 Implementation**: Osmosis adopts EIP 1559 to manage transaction fees and governance, ensuring scalability and efficiency.  
- **Grant Program**: Projects like Milk Tia are funded through the Osmosis Grant Program, prioritizing long-term value for the ecosystem.  
- **User Retention Metrics**: The content implies that 100 new addresses may retain a significant portion (e.g., 70–80%) due to strong user experience and community support.  
- **Governance Activity**: Osmosis is the most active Cosmos chain for governance, indicating robust community involvement.  

### Related Topics  
- **EIP 1559**: The content references EIP 1559 as a technical feature of Osmosis, linking to broader Ethereum/DeFi discussions.  
- **Interchain DeFi**: Osmosis is positioned as a critical hub for cross-chain DeFi applications, connecting to broader blockchain interoperability trends.  
- **Grant Program**: The grant initiative is tied to Osmosis’s strategy for long-term ecosystem growth, potentially aligning with documentation sections on funding models or community governance.

the world of appchains  More than 50 blockchains are currently connected, with dozens more in development— @dYdX  Chain, or  @Injective_

No doubt that  @osmosiszone  is the most dominant DEX in  @cosmos

The way Milk Tia is fully integrated into osmosis is amazing.

Osmosis is becoming the interchain App Store.

@OsmosisZone has established itself as the hub of the Celestia modular ecosystem.

I think Osmosis Grant Program has done a really good job funding things that are LONG TERM value accretive to Osmosis

People who are new to Cosmos don't truly understand the dominating crushing nature of Osmosis

User Retention
If 100 new addresses used these dexs.... how many would remain?

Here's my experience: Best support experience in whole of crypto - better than any CEX out there.

Osmosis is:
✔️ Layer-1  blockchain ecosystem
✔️ Best DEX in Cosmos
⏳ Interface for the Interchain (Asset Hub)

Osmosis is coming for EVERYTHING

Osmosis is ahead of their time. Top 5 builders in crypto…maybe higher.

The Osmosis UI is really gorgeous

ATOM is Money • Osmosis the DeFi Hub

Osmosis is the premier cross-chain DeFi hub ⚛️  As the liquidity center and primary trading venue of Cosmos, Osmosis is the access point for the world of appchains  More than 50 blockchains are currently connected, with dozens more in development— @dYdX  Chain, or  @Injective_

EIP 1559 on Osmosis is amazing

Every defi app should build on osmosis

Osmosis is not just one of the most active projects by dev activity (see @cryptomanran's post below), it's also the most active Cosmos chain for
governance activity EVERY SINGLE MONTH
