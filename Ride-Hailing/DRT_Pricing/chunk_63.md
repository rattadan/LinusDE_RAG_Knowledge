## Chunk 63

**Original Text:**

Without a minimum charge, for both service area setups, only a share of 4% switch from
car to DRT. Charging a minimum fee has a significant effect on the total number of DRT trips as well as the modal
shift: For a higher minimum fee, the number of users switching from bicycle and walk to the DRT mode is
drastically reduced. And instead, users switching from PT to DRT is observed to be the strongest modal shift effect. Nevertheless, even for a relatively high minimum fee, a significant share of DRT users come from the bicycle and
walk mode. The DRT service area is found to have a strong impact on the modal shift between car and DRT.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The text describes the effects of varying minimum fees on the number of people switching from car to Dynamic Rapid Transit (DRT) services, as well as the overall modal shift between car and DRT modes.

In general, the text suggests that a higher minimum fee can lead to:

* A decrease in the number of users who switch from bicycles and walks to DRT mode
* Instead, the use of PT (Public Transportation) becomes more prominent

However, it also notes that even at relatively high minimum fees, a significant share of DRT users come from bicycles and walks.

The text implies that the DRT service area has a strong impact on the modal shift between car and DRT modes, indicating that it is an effective way to encourage people to switch to DRT.
