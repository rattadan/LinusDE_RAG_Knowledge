   - Confident, aspirational, and intentionally ambiguous to spark curiosity  

3. **Evaluation of legitimacy**:

   - Legitimacy is unclear due to lack of tangible details, but engagement metrics (high likes, retweets) suggest an active community

The partnership with SatLayer hints at broader ecosystem integration, but the vagueness of phrases like "Kaito things" suggests an emphasis on branding over substance, possibly to compensate for underdeveloped technical narratives.
