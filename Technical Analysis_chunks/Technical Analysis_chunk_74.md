## Technical Analysis - Chunk 74

**Document Summary:**

**Key Points:**

* Technical analysis is a method used by traders to predict where the market might be heading by studying charts, patterns, and various technical indicators.
* Technical indicators are like tools that help traders make sense of price data and are used in technical analysis.
* Types of technical indicators include volume, momentum, and trend indicators, which can be grouped together.
* Popular technical indicators include the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Simple Moving Average (SMA), Bollinger Bands, and Relative Strength Index (RSI).
* MACD is a versatile and reliable technical indicator that can enhance trading strategies by identifying trends, momentum shifts, and reversal points.
* Moving averages are statistical tools used in technical analysis to smoothing out price data and help identify trends and potential reversal points.
* Different types of moving averages include simple, exponential, and weighted moving averages.
* Moving averages play several roles in cryptocurrency trading, including smoothing out price data, identifying trends, and providing support and resistance levels.
* Moving averages can be combined with other indicators, such as RSI and MACD, to create more robust trading strategies.
* Moving averages have several advantages and disadvantages, including simplicity and effectiveness in trending markets, but also lagging indicator and less effective in volatile or sideways markets.
* Risk management is crucial in trading and moving averages can be incorporated into risk management strategies by setting stop-loss levels and combining with other indicators.

**Original Text:**

The default settings show three moving averages: SMA for 7, 25, and 99 days. Users can hide these individually by clicking on the eye icon or collapse their description by clicking on the arrow below the rows. Clicking on the gear symbol for settings allows users to change their colour and style of line. More importantly, users can move between SMA, EMA, and WMA, and adjust the MA time frame. For this, change the number in the ‘length’ field to define the averaging period. How Traders Use Moving Averages to Predict the Crypto Market
To understand the practical application of moving averages in cryptocurrency trading, let’s examine a few examples. Bitcoin 2017 Bull Run

During the 2017 bull run, Bitcoin’s price often found support at the 50-day EMA. Traders who recognised this pattern and entered positions when the price bounced off the EMA would have significantly profited. Ethereum 2018 Bear Market

In the 2018 bear market, Ethereum’s price repeatedly encountered resistance at the 200-day SMA.
