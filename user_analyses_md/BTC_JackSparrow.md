- The use of "hmm" at the end gives it a reflective quality

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
- The tweet itself is legitimate in the sense that it's a genuine expression of sentiment
- However, it lacks specific details about what exactly is being referred to, making it difficult to assess factual accuracy
- The tweet could be spreading a conspiracy theory if "they" refers to some shadowy group controlling access to Bitcoin
