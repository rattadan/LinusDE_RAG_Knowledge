## Chunk 39

**Original Text:**

The pick-up and drop-off duration is set to 1 minute. DRT vehicles interact with each other as well
as with private cars and trucks (dynamic congestion). Travel times within public transport (PT) mode result from
walking times from and to the transit stop, waiting times and in-vehicle times based on the schedule. In this simulation
setup, buses and tramways do not interact with DRT vehicles, private cars or bicycles. The walk, bicycle and ride
mode are simulated in a simplified way, i.e.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're describing a transportation simulation model that considers various modes of transportation, including public transport (PT), dynamic congestion, and the interaction between different types of vehicles.

To clarify, DRT stands for Dedicated Public Transit, which refers to dedicated bus or tramway services that operate in separate lanes or tracks within a larger highway system. The term "Dynamic Congestion" likely refers to the interactions between these dedicated buses or trams and private cars or trucks that use shared roads or highways.

Given this context, I'll assume you're asking about how to model the interaction between DRT vehicles and private cars or trucks in the simulation setup.

One possible approach would be to add a "Vehicle Type" attribute to the vehicle types (DRT vehicles, private cars or trucks) to track their specific behaviors and interactions. For example:

* DRT vehicles could have a separate schedule for arrival and departure times, taking into account the dedicated bus or tramway routes.
* Private cars or trucks might be modeled as general road users, with their own schedules and travel times based on traffic conditions.
* When interacting with each other, DRT vehicles would follow their scheduled route and wait for available time slots to depart or enter the designated bus or tramway lane.

To simulate this interaction, you could introduce "waiting" states in your simulation, where DRT vehicles wait at designated stops for passengers or for a window of opportunity to leave the dedicated bus or tramway lane. When a private car or truck arrives and requests service, it would need to find an available slot on the dedicated bus or tramway lane.

The interaction between DRT vehicles and private cars or trucks could be modeled using simple rules, such as:

* If two DRT vehicles are approaching the same stop at the same time, they would wait together for a short period before moving apart.
* If multiple private cars or trucks arrive within a certain timeframe, they would be assigned to the first available space on the dedicated bus or tramway lane.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible approach, and you may need to refine or modify your simulation setup based on specific requirements or constraints.
