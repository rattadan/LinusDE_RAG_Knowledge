cycle theory is popular amongst cryptocurrency enthusiasts, it's a highly speculative idea, and there's never a guarantee past performance will be replicated in the future. Even if BTC's supply goes down, there must be enough buying pressure to trigger a sustained bullish move. If there's not enough demand for BTC or other assets post-halving, the four-year cycle model will prove incorrect. Additionally, other factors unique to the crypto space can impact and turn a bull market, such as government regulation, enforcement actions and issues with banks that focus on cryptocurrency.Â Â
