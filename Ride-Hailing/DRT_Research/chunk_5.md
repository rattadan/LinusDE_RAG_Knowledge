**Original Text:**

In the end, proposed optimization strategies are compared using a numerical example. Introduction
Demand responsive transit (DRT) systems are a class of transit services in which a fleet of vehicles dynamically changes routes and schedules in order to accommodate demand within a service area. A DRT system naturally has flexibility in providing service, which allows it to adapt to variations in the demand. This property of DRT makes it possible to eliminate the access distance for transit users by providing a curb-to-curb trip. The trade-off is that each user of the system must wait for a vehicle to pick them up and spend time in the system while the transit vehicles divert to pick up and drop off other passengers.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

To better understand the proposed optimization strategies for demand responsive transit (DRT) systems, let's consider a numerical example.

Suppose we have a DRT system that serves a city with two major hubs: Hub A and Hub B. The objective of this system is to minimize the total travel time for passengers who request a trip from one hub to another.

Let's assume there are three types of trips:

1. Trips between Hub A and Hub C, which have a fixed route and frequency.
2. Trips between Hub A and Hub D, which also have a fixed route but with varying frequencies based on demand.
3. Trips between Hub B and Hub E, which have an unpredictable schedule due to changes in passenger demand.

The proposed optimization strategy is to allocate vehicles between these trips in a way that minimizes the total travel time for passengers. The goal is to find the optimal allocation of vehicles to each type of trip while considering the constraints:

* Each vehicle can only be allocated to one type of trip.
* Vehicles cannot be idle, and all passengers must be served within a certain time frame.

To solve this problem using a numerical example, we'll use the following assumptions:

* The demand for trips between Hub A and Hub C is 500 passengers per day (with a maximum capacity of 1,000 passengers).
* The demand for trips between Hub A and Hub D is 300 passengers per day.
* The demand for trips between Hub B and Hub E is unknown.

We'll use a simple integer programming model to optimize the allocation of vehicles. Let's denote:

* V_A as the number of vehicles allocated to trip between Hub A and Hub C.
* V_D as the number of vehicles allocated to trip between Hub A and Hub D.
* V_E as the number of vehicles allocated to trip between Hub B and Hub E.

The objective function is to minimize the total travel time for passengers:

Total Travel Time = (500 * 1.5 + 300 * 2.0) / 3 + (V_A * 30 minutes) + (V_D * 60 minutes)

where 1.5 represents the fixed route and frequency, 2.0 represents the varying frequencies based on demand, and 30 minutes represents the travel time.

To find the optimal values of V_A, V_D, and V_E, we'll need to solve this integer programming model using a numerical optimization algorithm.
