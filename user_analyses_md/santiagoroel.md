Putting some tweets in bigger context of intentions:
The tweet about focusing on distribution rather than product (first-time vs second-time founders) fits with the overall theme of strategic thinking about crypto adoption. It suggests the author learns from others' experiences and applies those insights to their own venture (Inversion).

The warning about lingo that should set off warning bells shows the author wants to educate others in the crypto space about potential red flags, indicating they're concerned about responsible participation in the ecosystem.

The DePIN tweet shows the author is looking beyond the speculation aspects of crypto to real-world applications that could transform industries, reinforcing that they're interested in crypto's practical applications rather than just price speculation.

The tweet about "A" players from Steve Jobs suggests the author cares about quality and excellence in team-building, which would be important for any crypto venture they might be involved with.

The quotes about Jevons Paradox and software-as-a-service demonstrate the author is thinking deeply about economic principles and how crypto services might follow similar adoption patterns to internet technologies.
