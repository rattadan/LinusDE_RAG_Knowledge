## CosmosNetwork - Chunk 57

**Document Summary:**

This overview provides an excellent foundation for understanding Tendermint Core's architecture and its Application Binary Interface (ABCI). Let's break down the key components and their functionalities:

### 1. **Tendermint Core**
   - **Role**: Responsible for consensus, validation, and block propagation.
   - **Components**:
     - **Block Proposal**: Proposes new blocks based on transaction data.
     - **Commit Vote**: Collects votes from validators to finalize a block.
     - **Consensus Logic**: Implements BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) logic.

### 2. **ABCI Interface**
   - **Purpose**: Allows the application logic to interact with Tendermint Core.
   - **Primary Messages**:
     - **AppendTx**: Delivers transactions for validation and inclusion in blocks.
     - **CheckTx**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block (optional).
     - **Commit**: Computes cryptographic commitments of the current state.

### 3. **Application Logic**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Validate and process transactions.
     - Update application state based on transaction outcomes.
     - Respond to ABCI messages with appropriate responses.
     - Handle consensus-related tasks like reorg-proposals (if necessary).

### Detailed Breakdown

#### **AppendTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Delivers a transaction for validation and inclusion in the blockchain.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core receives a new transaction via the network.
  2. The transaction is passed to the application via `AppendTx`.
  3. Application validates the transaction against its state, protocol rules, and credentials.
  4. If valid, the application updates its internal state (e.g., UTXO database).
  5. Tendermint Core schedules the transaction for inclusion in a block.

#### **CheckTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core's mempool first checks each transaction with `CheckTx`.
  2. If the transaction passes, it is relayed to other peers for further validation.
  3. Validated transactions are then passed to application via `AppendTx` for state updates.

#### **Commit Message**
- **Purpose**: Computes a cryptographic commitment of the current application state.
- **Flow**:
  1. After processing all transactions in a block, Tendermint Core computes the commit state.
  2. This commit is signed by validators based on their voting power.
  3. The commit is then included in the next block header.

### Additional Features

#### **Validator Set Management**
- **Messages**: `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock`.
- **Purpose**:
  - `BeginBlock`: Passed to application at the start of each block, allowing it to update its state.
  - `EndBlock`: Passed after transactions have been processed, enabling finalization actions like reorg-proposal signing.

#### **Lightweight Client Support**
- **Commit Hashes**: Signed by validators, providing cryptographic proof of committed states.
- **Merkle Proofs**: Simplify verification for lightweight clients using block hashes and signed commit votes.

### Handling Byzantine Faults

1. **Forks**:
   - ≥ ⅓ Byzantine voting power can cause forks.
   - Detectable through inconsistencies in the state root, triggering social consensus mechanisms to heal the network.

2. **Censorship Attacks**:
   - > ⅔ Byzantine voting power can commit arbitrary invalid states.
   - Social consensus and legal measures are necessary for handling such failures.

3. **Reorg-Proposal Coordination**:
   - Signed by +½ of original validators, ensuring that external coordination is robust to network partitions.

### Conclusion
ABCI provides a flexible interface for integrating application logic with Tendermint Core’s consensus mechanism. By carefully validating transactions and updating state, applications can ensure consistency and reliability in blockchain operations. The ability to handle Byzantine faults through social consensus mechanisms further strengthens the overall system's resilience.

**Original Text:**

because the proposal was spam), the deposit goes to the reserve pool, except any atoms which are burned. For each proposal, voters may vote with the following options:

Yea
YeaWithForce
Nay
NayWithForce
Abstain
A strict majority of Yea or YeaWithForce votes (or Nay or NayWithForce votes) is required for the proposal to be decided as passed (or decided as failed), but 1/3+ can veto the majority decision by voting "with force". When a strict majority is vetoed, everyone gets punished by losing VetoPenaltyFeeBlocks (DEFAULT 1 day's worth of blocks) worth of fees (except taxes which will not be affected), and the party that vetoed the majority decision will be additionally punished by losing VetoPenaltyAtoms (DEFAULT 0.1%) of its atoms. Parameter Change Proposal
Any of the parameters defined here can be changed with the passing of a ParameterChangeProposal. Bounty Proposal
Atoms can be inflated and reserve pool funds spent with the passing of a BountyProposal.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the technical details behind Tendermint Core's Application Binary Interface (ABCI) and its role in handling Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). Here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details:**

1. **AppendTx Message**: Delivers transactions for validation and inclusion in blocks, requiring application logic to validate transactions before including them in the blockchain.
2. **CheckTx Message**: Validates transactions against the current state, protocol rules, and credentials, and passes validated transactions to other peers if necessary.
3. **Commit**: Computes a cryptographic commitment of the current application state and includes it in the next block header after processing all transactions.

**Context Connection:**

This chunk is building upon the surrounding context by explaining how Tendermint Core's consensus mechanism handles transactions and blocks in a blockchain network, specifically focusing on Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). This involves understanding the role of validators, their voting power, and the mechanisms for detecting and handling failures like forks, censorship attacks, and reorg-proposals.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. **Validating transactions**: Requires application logic to validate transactions against the current state and protocol rules.
2. **Handling Byzantine faults**: Requires understanding of BFT mechanics, such as strict majority decisions, veto power, and penalty fees for failing to vote with force.
3. **Parameter changes and proposals**: Requires knowledge of how to modify parameters, define bounty proposals, or propose changes to the ABCI.

**Additional Information:**

The text also provides a detailed explanation of additional features and mechanisms, such as validator set management, lightweight client support, commit hashes, Merkle proofs, and handling of forks, censorship attacks, and reorg-proposals. These details are important for understanding how Tendermint Core's consensus mechanism works and how applications can integrate with it effectively.

Overall, this chunk is explaining the technical foundation behind Tendermint Core's ABCI and its role in managing transactions and blocks in a blockchain network, specifically focusing on BFT mechanisms.
