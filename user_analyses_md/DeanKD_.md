- The author uses no emojis, hashtags, or other embellishments in this specific tweet, keeping it straightforward

4. Legitimacy evaluation:
This tweet presents a claimed "rumored" fee structure for Binance listings:
- The content appears factual but cannot be verified from this tweet alone
- The claim about Binance listing fees being $2m plus 10% of token supply is a commonly circulated rumor in crypto circles, though Binance has never officially confirmed it
- The tweet doesn't provide any sources or evidence to support the claim
- The author positions themselves as someone who has insider knowledge about exchange listing processes
- Without citation or evidence, this can't be considered a reliable source about Binance's actual listing fees

- The tweet could also be motivated by a desire to appear knowledgeable or in-the-know about the inner workings of exchanges

Emotional patterns:

Decision-making approach:

- They focus on sharing information rather than engaging in discussions (no replies or threads shown)
- They make claims without providing evidence, which might indicate a willingness to share unverified information they believe is true

Putting this tweet in context:
This appears to be the only tweet provided, so I can't establish broader patterns of behavior. However, the content suggests the author wants to be seen as someone who has access to insider knowledge about cryptocurrency exchanges and is willing to share it publicly. The tweet presents information that would be relevant to cryptocurrency projects seeking exchange listings, potentially positioning the author as someone who understands the challenges projects face in getting listed on major exchanges.

The tweet seems to serve multiple potential purposes: it might be an attempt to appear knowledgeable about the industry, to inform followers about perceived barriers to entry for new tokens, and potentially to criticize Binance's listing practices indirectly.
