## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 6

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Research on the use of single-occupant SAVs from across the world shows added eVMT in the
range of 10-30% (Spieser et al., 2014; Fagnant et al., 2015; Bischoff and Maciejewski, 2016;
Simoni et al., 2019; Gurumurthy et al., 2020a). DRS is one strategy to manage rising VMT - if
users are willing to share their rides (Agatz et al., 2011). Bilali et al. (2019) argue that detour
time is important when it comes to a fleet’s shareability, since travelers’ detour time flexibility
relates directly to a DRS algorithm’s routing flexibility, which is rather essential for high rates of
trip-matching. However, added delay from DRS detours is considered a key factor in many
travelers’ unwillingness to share rides with those who do not share their origin and destination
(Lavieri and Bhat (2019). Hyland and Mahmassani’s (2020) optimization of SAV operations
with DRS illustrates how even slight flexibility in detours and delays can prove very useful at the
network and total-system-cost levels.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes:**

This chunk describes a specific technical detail related to the use of single-occupant electric vehicles (SAVs) with a driverless autonomous vehicle (DAV). The relevant technical parameter here is:

* eVMT (Electrification-Vehicle-Middle-Traffic): This refers to the percentage increase in electrification (or energy conversion efficiency) of the DAV system.

**Context and Connection:**

This chunk connects to its surrounding context by providing a brief overview of shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) usage trends, specifically highlighting that single-occupant SAVs have seen an added eVMT of 10-30%. This information is presented within the broader discussion on DRS (Driverless Restraint Systems) and its potential benefits in managing rising Vehicle-to-Machine Traffic (VMT).

The chunk also explicitly mentions Bilali et al. (2019), Lavieri and Bhat (2019), and Hyland and Mahmassani's (2020) research, which focuses on the optimization of SAV operations with DRS. This context is crucial for understanding how these technical details are being applied in the field.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

None explicitly mentioned in this chunk. However:

* The timeframe of 2014 to 2020 indicates a specific time period within which the research was conducted.
* Key authors such as K.M. Kockelman and M. Yan (likely from the American Association for the Advancement of Science) are mentioned, indicating that their research may have been influential in shaping the discussion on SAV usage trends.

**Analysis:**

This chunk is primarily explaining a specific technical detail related to the use of single-occupant SAVs with DRS systems. The added eVMT (10-30%) suggests that these vehicles are being optimized for electrification, implying that there may be opportunities for further improvement in terms of energy efficiency and reduced emissions.

The connection to its surrounding context highlights the importance of understanding the broader implications of SAV usage trends on VMT management and optimization. This information can inform urban transportation strategies and vehicle fleet operations more effectively.
