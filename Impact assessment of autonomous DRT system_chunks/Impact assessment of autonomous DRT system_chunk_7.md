## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 7

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

- Simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
- Evaluates operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.
- Includes detailed breakdowns of daily operational costs for stop-based and door-to-door systems.
2. **Contextual Connection:**
- This chunk is part of a larger paper that discusses the potential impact of fully automated DRT systems on traditional public transport operations in Cottbus, Germany.
- It builds upon the surrounding context by providing technical details about the simulation approach, travel times and costs comparison, operational cost analysis, and other aspects of the study.
3. **Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**
- The text mentions that the current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture operational costs under all scenarios (Limitations). This implies that further research is required to consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice.
