## What Is the Decentralized Physical Infra - Chunk 37

**Document Summary:**

The case of decentralized physical infrastructure projects like Helium and Filecoin highlights both the potential and the challenges in this emerging sector. Here are some key takeaways:

### Potential:
1. **Innovative Use Cases**: Projects like Helium's LoRaWAN network and Filecoin's decentralized storage solutions offer promising applications for IoT and data storage, respectively.
2. **Decentralization Benefits**: By leveraging blockchain technology, these projects aim to create more secure and resilient networks that can operate without central authorities.

### Challenges:
1. **Exaggerated Use Cases**: Projects often promise a lot but struggle to deliver tangible value or revenue in the short term.
2. **Economic Sustainability**: Token incentives and economic models need to be carefully designed to ensure long-term viability. Over-reliance on initial rewards can lead to unsustainable practices.
3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: As these technologies become more mainstream, they will face increasing regulatory scrutiny, which could limit their growth.

### Case Studies:
1. **Helium**:
   - **Initial Success**: Grew quickly with over 900,000 hotspots by July 2023.
   - **Revenue Issues**: Despite a large user base, revenue has been minimal and mostly driven by hardware sales.
   - **Executive Criticism**: Allegations of insider hoarding and early frontloading have damaged the project's reputation.

2. **Filecoin**:
   - **Initial Hype**: Gained significant traction during its bull market period but struggled with economic models.
   - **Token Dilution**: Introduction of Filecoin Plus led to a shift in user behavior, reducing storage deal revenue significantly.
   - **Sustainability Concerns**: The lack of a clear use case for the FIL token and potential future selling pressure remain major concerns.

### Future Outlook:
- **Long-term Viability**: Both projects need to demonstrate that they can sustain their operations beyond initial hype. This requires building robust economic models, finding new revenue streams, and addressing regulatory challenges.
- **Community Engagement**: Projects like Helium and Filecoin must engage with the community more effectively to ensure long-term support and trust.
- **Innovation**: Continued innovation in technology and use cases is crucial for maintaining relevance in a competitive market.

### Conclusion:
While decentralized physical infrastructure projects have the potential to disrupt traditional industries, they face significant hurdles in terms of economic sustainability and community engagement. Investors and stakeholders should approach these projects with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before committing resources or capital.

As always, do your own research (DYOR) to ensure you are making informed decisions.

**Original Text:**

Well, it turns out that Helium raised a lot of money, but its use case was, let’s say, exaggerated. Here are Helium’s weekly revenue numbers over the last year:

Allegedly, most of that revenue was driven by selling hardware to new network providers. That would mean that supply was going up, but there was almost zero revenue from actual demand for Helium’s product. Web3 critic, Liron Shapira, made the case that Helium was built on an overblown use case and took in a measly $6.5K in revenue from demand for data in June 2022. The incentives, he said, are not sustainable. Helium CEO, Amir Haleem, responded that Helium is in it for the long run, and demand for its use case isn’t even there yet:


It remains to be seen whether the demand is likely to show up soon, however Helium’s has pivoted to 5G help, although that did not help its cratering revenue and token price.
