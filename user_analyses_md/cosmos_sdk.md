The ecosystem is probably the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, which is a framework for building blockchains. The account is promoting the Cosmos SDK, which is a toolkit for developing blockchain applications.

For the author's character, the communication is professional and concise. The use of technical terms indicates expertise. The motivation is likely to inform developers about the new features to attract or retain users. The emotional tone is positive and enthusiastic, aiming to generate interest.
