### Document Overview  
Noble XYZ raises $15M in Series A funding, collaborating with M^0 to create USDN, a dollar-denominated stablecoin on the Cosmos network, aiming for interoperability, DeFi adoption, and hyper-scalability.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Cosmos-based blockchain**: A decentralized network for cross-chain transactions and interoperability.  
- **USDN (Stablecoin)**: A dollar-denominated token leveraging M^0’s infrastructure for stability and scalability.  
- **M^0’s infrastructure**: A stablecoin provider enabling decentralized, programmable, and interoperable stablecoins.  
- **Interoperability**: Cross-chain communication (e.g., via CCTP) to connect 50+ blockchains.  
- **Programmable yield**: Token-based financial applications (e.g., swaps, lending).  
- **Hyper-scalability**: Efficient issuance across 50+ blockchains with optimized performance.  
- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Blockchain-based financial applications (e.g., lending, trading).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Funding**: $15M Series A led by Paradigm, highlighting DeFi market growth.  
- **USDN Design**: Leverages $M (M^0’s token) as a core building block for a neutral, programmable digital dollar.  
- **Scalability**: Focus on interoperability (CCTP) and performance standards across 50+ blockchains.  
- **Volume**: Exceeded $5B in its first year, emphasizing growth in decentralized finance.  
- **Protocols**: Use of M^0’s infrastructure and CCTP for cross-chain token transfer.  

### Related Topics  
- **DeFi Adoption**: Connection to broader DeFi market trends and partnerships (e.g., Paradigm).  
- **Stablecoin Standards**: Efforts to define scalability and performance benchmarks in the crypto industry.  
- **Interoperability Protocols**: CCTP as a key technical feature enabling cross-chain workflows.  
- **Tokenization**: USDN’s role in redefining stablecoin infrastructure and liquidity provision.

The Cosmos-based Noble blockchain is the first to launch a new dollar-denominated token, USDN, using decentralized stablecoin infrastructure provided by stablecoin upstart M^0, according to an announcement on Thursday. USDN will leverage $M as its âcore building blockâ to provide the broader Interchain ecosystem with âa credibly neutral digital dollar,â the company said in a statement. 

âThis collaboration not only advances Cosmos-native stablecoin adoption but sets a new precedent for stablecoin design by focusing on safety, programmability, and interoperability,â Noble CEO Jelena Djuric said. âWeâre excited to redefine what stablecoin infrastructure can achieve within decentralized finance.â
