## Chunk 9

**Original Text:**

2.1. Network
The implementation of peer-to-peer protocols in mobile applications can be challenging, especially due to
the dynamic nature of mobile devicesâ€™ network conditions, which often do not have a static public IP address. However, nRide has tackled this problem by leveraging NKN, a blockchain-based overlay network. NKN (New Kind of Network) provides multiple independent and self-organized relay nodes, enabling
clients to send and receive data for free without requiring a server or third-party services. This eliminates
the need for clients to have a public IP address or port forwarding.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you've provided a passage explaining how nRide leverages NKN (a blockchain-based overlay network) to overcome the challenges of implementing peer-to-peer protocols in mobile applications due to dynamic network conditions.

To break it down:

- **Dynamic nature of mobile devices' network conditions**: This refers to the unpredictable and often unstable internet connection on mobile devices, which can make it difficult for applications to establish reliable connections.
  
- **Challenges of peer-to-peer protocols**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols are essential in mobile applications as they enable direct communication between two parties without the need for a centralized server. However, they can be tricky to implement due to the dynamic nature of network conditions.

- **Role of NKN**: NKN is an innovative solution that addresses these challenges by introducing an overlay network consisting of multiple independent and self-organized relay nodes. This decentralized architecture allows clients (or users) to communicate without relying on a traditional server or third-party services, thereby minimizing the need for a public IP address or port forwarding.

In essence, nRide's use of NKN provides a scalable and secure way to enable peer-to-peer communication in mobile applications, overcoming the limitations associated with dynamic network conditions.
