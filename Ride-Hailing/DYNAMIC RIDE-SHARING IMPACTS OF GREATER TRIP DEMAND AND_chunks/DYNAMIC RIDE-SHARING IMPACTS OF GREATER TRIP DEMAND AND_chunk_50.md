## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 50

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining how shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance can be optimized using techniques such as ride-splitting services.

1. The technical details described include:
- Ride-splitting: the practice of dividing passengers into smaller groups to reduce congestion and wait times.
- Optimization techniques: algorithms and strategies used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ride-splitting services.
2. This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by providing a specific solution to a problem (i.e., optimizing shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance). It expands on the discussion of shared autonomous vehicles in the provided document, offering concrete examples and research findings from 2014 to 2020.
3. The requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned include:
- A system of shared autonomous vehicles: the presence of multiple vehicles operating under a common authority, which is essential for ride-splitting services.
- Market data: specific studies (e.g., Fagnant et al., 2015; Gurumurthy et al., 2021) that provide insights into the operations and performance of shared autonomous vehicle fleets.

In terms of analyzing this chunk's content, it can be concluded that:
