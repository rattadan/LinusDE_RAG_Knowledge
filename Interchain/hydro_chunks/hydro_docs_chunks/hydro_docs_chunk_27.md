**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

# Bidder Guide
------------

Hydro allocates liquidity through sequential auction rounds, each lasting one month. Bidders compete by offering tribute to voters. This onboarding guide describes how projects may create and submit bids to participate in the auction process. The best way to get started as a Hydro bidder is to schedule a call with Brian Truax from the Hydro team. He will walk you through the process and answer initial questions. Before starting, briefly familiarize yourself with the complete process of creating a bid through to winning and monitoring a deployment.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Text Chunk**

1. **Technical Details and Parameters**:
   - Hydro allocates liquidity through sequential auction rounds, each lasting one month.
   - Bidders compete by offering tribute to voters.
   - There is a reference to a Community call with Brian Truax from the Hydro team, but no specific technical details are provided.

2. **Connection to Surrounding Context**:
   - The text chunk is part of the Hydro document and redirects users to the Bidder Overview link, indicating that it connects to the larger documentation on the platform.
   - The mention of a call with Brian Truax suggests that the surrounding context may include involvement of the Hydro team in the bidding process, but no specific connection is made to the technical details or processes mentioned in previous sections.

3. **Specific Requirements and Constraints**:
   - Projects need to schedule a call with Brian Truax to get assistance.
   - Briefly familiarize yourself with the complete process of creating a bid through to winning and monitoring a deployment before starting.
   - The text does not mention any specific requirements or constraints related to bid submissions, such as bid templates or deployment tests, which are mentioned in the User and Bidder Guides section.

**Overall Analysis**:
The text chunk appears to be an introduction and onboarding guide for bidders to participate in the Hydro auction process. It encourages users to schedule a call with Brian Truax and mention the necessary steps in the bidding process but lacks specific technical details or connection to the surrounding context in terms of technical aspects of the Hydro platform.
