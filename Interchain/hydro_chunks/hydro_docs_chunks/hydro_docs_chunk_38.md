**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

If delays occur due to unresolved bidder-side issues, it may result in forfeiture of the deployment. In some cases, the Hydro committee may be able to extend liquidity deployment for up to 30 days post-resolution, but extensions are contingent on the availability of sufficient capital reserves and are not guaranteed in future rounds. ## Queries
-------

Bidders must submit deployment queries and transaction details as part of their bid submission to ensure that the Hydro team and committee can accurately monitor deployed funds. An LCD query to check the current holdings of the Hydro account in the deployment venue. A query to check the total TVL in the venue. Output must include the principal asset(s) amounts (for example, in ATOM and stATOM for an ATOM<>stATOM pool). ## Transactions
------------

Bidders must also submit transaction details as part of their bid submission to ensure that the Hydro team and committee can execute liquidity deployments efficiently.

    -   It references "principal asset(s) amounts" that must be reported in bid submissions for assets such as ATOM and stATOM in a pool.
    -   Bidders are required to submit transaction details for "efficient" liquidity deployments.
2.  **Connection to Surrounded Context:**
    -   This text chunk appears to be a specific part of the user and bidder guides within the Hydro platform documentation.
    -   It relates to the deployment process and bidding requirements for users and bidders.
    -   The text provides details on the necessary information and queries required for accurate monitoring and execution of liquidity deployments.
3.  **Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**
    -   Bidders must submit deployment queries and transaction details as part of their bid submission.
    -   The queries should include LCD checks on the Hydro account holdings and total TVL (Total Value Locked) in the deployment venue.
    -   The output of the queries should display principal asset amounts, such as ATOM and stATOM in the given examples.

The provided text chunk is focused on the necessary queries and transaction details required from bidders for the efficient execution of liquidity deployments within the Hydro platform.
