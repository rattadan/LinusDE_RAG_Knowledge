## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on decisions and main issues.

Starting from the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's important for context, so maybe mention that support is available there.

Then, looking at kychuli and zzxzzzzzzjdk's conversation. They mention an issue with DOT and SOL alloy tokens, specifically Picasso assets causing problems. The devs are working on it, and the swap button is greyed out until fixed. Also, kychuli says they can pin something once sorted, but the timeframe is unclear. So the main points here are the technical issue with alloy tokens, the ongoing fix, and the temporary inability to swap or transfer back.

Next, a_b_c1001 and GPKwee are discussing swapping SOL to SOL.wh. The swap button is greyed out, and they suggest converting to USDC first and then to SOL.wh, but note that liquidity might be low, causing slippage. Also, there's a mention of the transmutter pool and whether tokens are stuck there. So here, the key points are the workaround using USDC, liquidity issues, and high slippage for large amounts.

Then, there's a discussion about e-money (NGM) chain. LoveRassulullah is trying to get NGM from Osmosis but can't send it because the restake isn't working, so they're offering OSMO for native NGM. GPKwee questions if the chain is still active, and they discuss whether it's a ghost chain with no relayers maintained. The project might be dead, but there's still staking and liquidity. So the main issue here is the NGM chain's status and the problem with transferring tokens due to expired channels or lack of maintenance.

Other messages are general comments about crypto volatility, projects failing, and DYOR (Do Your Own Research). These are less critical but might be worth a brief mention.

Putting it all together: The main issues are the DOT/SOL alloy token problems causing swap issues, the workaround with USDC, and the NGM chain transfer problem. Devs are aware and working on fixes, but no timeframes. Users are advised to use support links for help.

I need to structure this clearly, maybe in bullet

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify what they're talking about.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's about directing users to the support site. That's a support resource, so maybe "official support site" is a topic. Then kychuli mentions pinning something once sorted, which seems like a temporary hold, so "temporary pinning" could be a topic. Another user asks if they'll post when solved, so "posting updates after resolution" might be relevant.

Looking at the next messages, there's an issue with DOT and SOL alloy tokens causing problems, and devs are working on it. So "DOT and SOL alloy token issues" and "development team working on solution" come up. Users are having trouble swapping tokens due to high slippage and can't move back to Axelar, so "high slippage in token swaps" and "inability to transfer tokens back to Axelar" are topics.

Then there's a discussion about converting through USDC and using specific pools, which points to "token conversion process via USDC" and "pool liquidity limitations". The swap button being greyed out is another point, so "swap button disabled for certain conversions".

GPKwee provides links to specific pools, which could be "specific pool links for token swaps". The user a_b_c1001 mentions the frontend not allowing swaps from SOL to SOL.wh, so "frontend restrictions on SOL to SOL.wh swaps".

Another thread talks about the Calc tooling and why it's not integrated into the frontend. That's "Calc tooling integration into Osmo frontend". Then there's a mention of projects failing, like Om and Sui, which relates to "volatility in crypto projects".

Moving on to LoveRassulullah and GPKwee's conversation about e-money and NGM chain. They discuss the project possibly being dead, restaking manually, and relayers not being maintained. Topics here could be "status of NGM chain on e-money", "manual restaking on e-money", and "lack of relayer maintenance for ghost chains". Also, the mention of DYOR (Do Your Own Research) and investor responsibility is a point: "investor responsibility and DYOR".

The user also brings up

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a series of chat messages and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. I'll need to go through each message and see the tone.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to support. That's neutral, just providing help. Then kychuli says they can pin something once sorted but it might take time. The mention of an issue and waiting could be negative, but the user is offering help, so maybe neutral.

zzxzzzzzzjdk asks if they'll post when solved. Neutral. Then they thank and say they'll wait with an emoji. Positive because of the thanks and smiley. Next, kychuli explains there's an issue with DOT and SOL alloys, devs are working on it. Again, mentions a problem but also that they're addressing it. Maybe neutral leaning negative.

zzxzzzzzzjdk again mentions moving DOT to Osmosis, can't swap due to high slippage. Definitely negative because of the problem faced. Then kychuli says the swap button is greyed out until fixed. Neutral but indicates an issue, so maybe negative.

Looking at the rest, there's a discussion about swapping SOL to SOL.wh, some links provided. Users mention high slippage for large amounts, which is a negative point. GPKwee and a_b_c1001 talk about technical issues with the frontend and conversion fees. More negative aspects here.

Then there's a part about projects being dead, relayers not maintained, ghost chains. That's negative. However, some messages are just factual or explanatory without clear sentiment. For example, GPKwee's comment on crypto being wild and projects failing is a neutral observation. The user privetandreynugdejeti mentions being impressed by Calc tooling, which is positive, but also questions why it's not integrated, which could be a negative note on the current state.

Overall, there's a mix. The main issues are technical problems causing user frustration (negative), some neutral explanations from support, and a few positive notes like the thanks and the impressed comment. But the majority revolves around problems with the platform (DOT/SOL alloy issues, high slippage, greyed-out buttons) and concerns about projects being dead, which might tip the balance towards negative. However, since some messages are neutral or positive,

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a chat log with various messages from different people. My task is to go through each message and identify any specific actions that need to be taken, decisions made, or next steps mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's more of a support link, so maybe not an action item but just a reference. Then, kychuli says they can pin something once it's sorted, but it's not clear what needs to be pinned or who is responsible. Maybe that's a note for kychuli to follow up once the issue is resolved.

Next, zzxzzzzzzjdk asks if "they" will post when solved. The user might be referring to the devs or the team. Then they thank and say they'll wait. Not sure if that's an action item. The previous message from kychuli mentions an issue with dot and sol alloy, and devs are working on it. So the action item here is the devs need to resolve the issue with dot and sol alloy caused by Picasso assets.

Looking at the user's problem: zzxzzzzzzjdk moved DOT to Osmosis, converted to standardized version, can't swap due to high slippage or move back to Axelar. So the next step for them might be to wait until the issue is fixed, as mentioned by kychuli. Also, kychuli earlier mentioned that the swap button is greyed out until the issue is resolved, so the decision here is that the swap button remains grey until the devs fix the problem.

Then there's a message from GPKwee suggesting swapping to USDC first and then to Sol.wh via specific pools. So the action items here are for the user to follow those steps once the issue is resolved. Also, a_b_c1001 mentions the swap button is greyed out, which confirms that the current next step is to wait.

Another part is privetandreynugdejeti's comment about the Calc tooling not being integrated into the Osmo frontend. They're suggesting integration, so maybe a decision or next step for the Osmosis team to consider integrating the tooling for assets like Bitcoin, especially with their BTCFi focus.

Then there's a discussion about NGM chain and whether
