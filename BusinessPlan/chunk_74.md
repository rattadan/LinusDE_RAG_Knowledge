## Chunk 74

**Original Text:**

Blockchains can halt for various reasons, but
mainly during manual intervention when a critical
bug/vulnerability is found. Restarting a chain can take a
number of days because the community needs to review,
agree and vote on a new release candidate, and coordinate a
software upgrade. At the moment, Juno has a latency of 5s
per tx, which is fast in blockchain terms, but it is unclear how
much load it can take without undermining this metric. The nRide smart-contracts are compatible with any
CosmWasm enabled blockchain. To mitigate the risk of a
service outage or degraded performance on Juno, nRide will
deploy backup smart-contracts on other trusted chains such as
Archway and TGrade.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you're discussing the potential risks and mitigation strategies for blockchains, specifically in relation to the nRide smart-contracts on the CosmWasm-enabled blockchain, Juno.

To summarize, your points are:

1. Blockchains can be halted due to manual interventions when a critical bug or vulnerability is found.
2. The process of restarting a chain involves community review, agreement, voting, and software upgrades, which can take days.
3. There's a latency of 5 seconds per transaction (tx), but the question remains how much load it can handle without compromising its performance metric.
4. To mitigate risks, nRide will deploy backup smart-contracts on other trusted chains like Archway and TGrade.

It appears you're highlighting the importance of ensuring blockchain systems are robust and reliable, as well as being prepared for potential issues that may arise. This is a great starting point for discussing security, reliability, and scalability in blockchain development.

Can I help with anything else?
