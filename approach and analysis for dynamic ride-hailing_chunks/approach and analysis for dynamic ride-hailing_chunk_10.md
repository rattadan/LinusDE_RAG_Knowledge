I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

In most cases, a vehicle has only planned its very next
request since many settings do not allow sharing the vehicle with other
customers. By that, the problemâ€™s focus shifts towards quickly finding a
feasible matching between open requests and available vehicles (request
assignment ). To improve the quality of future assignments, currently
unused vehicles can be sent to different parts of the service area
(repositioning ) to balance supply and demand. In what follows, we first introduce different characteristics of the
problems studied in the literature. Afterwards, we present approaches
from the literature for assignment and repositioning. Please note that the
approaches used in the experimental study will be discussed in more
detail in Sections 4 and 5. Table 1 shows articles dealing with assignment strategies. The order
of the articles results from the classification made according to different
relevant problem characteristics.
