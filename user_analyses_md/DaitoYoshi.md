Legitness evaluation. The user is talking about a scam, so they might be a victim or someone warning others. The mention of specific projects suggests they have knowledge about these scams. But I need to check if they're a legitimate user or part of the scam. Since they're reporting others losing money, maybe they're a victim or a whistleblower.
