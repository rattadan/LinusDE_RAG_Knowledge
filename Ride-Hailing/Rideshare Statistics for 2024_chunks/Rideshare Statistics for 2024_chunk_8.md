**Original Text:**

Uber doesn’t only do rideshares — it also has a delivery service, Uber Eats (which, despite its name, is more than just food delivery), as well as a freight service for commercial trucking. That said, mobility (ridesharing) still makes up the largest segment of Uber’s business, at 56 percent. 2022 Uber revenue in millions

Segment	Uber Revenue 2024 Q1	Percentage of business
Mobility	$5.6 billion	56%
Delivery	$3.2 billion	32%
Freight	$1.3 billion	12%
Safety
More than 99.9 percent of all Uber and Lyft trips occur without a safety incident. However, we compared the latest safety data to see which company saw more car crash fatalities, physical assaults, and sexual assaults. Uber’s most recent U.S. Safety Report covers 2019 to 2020, while Lyft’s covers 2020 to 2022. So we’ve used data from Lyft’s previous report to calculate data for the period from 2019 to 2020 to make the comparison as fair as possible.
