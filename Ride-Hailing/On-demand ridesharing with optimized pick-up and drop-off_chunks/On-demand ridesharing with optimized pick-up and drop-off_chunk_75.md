‚Ä¢ Searching for the PUDO nodes does not reduce the running time much, and it increases both users‚Äô and operators‚Äô costs: in this
simple graph, the number of feasible nodes is small, so an exhaustive search is fast and better. It should be recalled, however that
this heuristic is meant for very granular graphs, as explained in Section 2.4. All in all, the heuristics prove useful. When we deal with a large instance of the problem in the following subsections, we are using
all the heuristics. 3.1.3.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk appears to be describing technical details related to ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems, specifically focusing on the use of heuristic optimization techniques.

**Technical Details:**

* The concept of "walking time" refers to the average travel time between two contiguous nodes in a graph.
* The variables mentioned include:
	+ `Max walking time`: the maximum allowed walking time between any two contiguous nodes.
	+ `Total number of requests`: the total number of ride requests made by users.
	+ `Av. in-vehicle time`: the average time spent in an in-vehicle (i.e., a vehicle traveling between two locations) for each request.
	+ `Max in-vehicle time`: the maximum allowed time spent in an in-vehicle for any request.
	+ `Min in-vehicle time`: the minimum allowed time spent in an in-vehicle for any request.
* The variable `|WD(u)|` represents the distance (or "walking" distance) between two nodes `u` and `v`.

**Context:**

The surrounding context provides a summary of key themes and papers related to ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems. This includes:

* A list of 10 papers, each addressing a specific aspect of these systems.
* A brief summary of the key papers mentioned in the reference list.

This text chunk is connecting to or building upon the surrounding context by describing the technical details used in heuristic optimization techniques for ridesharing systems. The use of variables such as `Max walking time`, `Av. in-vehicle time`, and `Min in-vehicle time` suggests a focus on optimizing ride request allocation, which is a key aspect of ridesharing systems.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no explicit requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this text chunk. However, the use of heuristic optimization techniques implies that the system is expected to perform well under various scenarios and with varying levels of demand, which may impact performance and efficiency.
