## Eureka - Chunk 18

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Satisfy the following basic requirements
The chain where the token is issued must already be supported by the Skip Go API
Use the /info/chains endpoint to query a list of actively supported chains: /v2/info/chains
If the chain is not already supported, follow the instructions in Chain Support Requirements to request support
This is a pre-requisite
The Skip Go API must also support the remote chains to which you wish users to be able to transfer the asset
Use the /info/chains endpoint to query a list of actively supported chains: /v2/info/chains
If the chain is not already supported, follow the instructions in Chain Support Requirements to request support
This is a pre-requisite
Token metadata is available in a commonly used chain registry (e.g. Cosmos Chain Registry) .

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the current text chunk:**

The given text chunk appears to be part of an overview or documentation on potential failure points and best practices for cross-chain asset transfers using the Skip Go API.

**Technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk:**

1. **Chain Support Requirements**: This refers to the process of requesting support from multiple chains (e.g., Cosmos Chain Registry) when a chain is not already supported by the Skip Go API.
2. **Remote Chains**: The Skip Go API must also support remote chains, which are chains that are not part of the same local network.

**Connections and building upon the surrounding context:**

This chunk builds upon the existing documentation on cross-chain asset transfers using the Skip Go API. It provides additional information on potential failure points, such as:

* Swap failures ( timeouts or slippage)
* Post-swap failures (tokens ending up on the wrong chain)
* Additional insights and recommendations for mitigating these risks.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

1. **Chain Support Requirements**: The document requires requesting support from multiple chains when a chain is not already supported by the Skip Go API.
2. **Remote Chains**: The document mentions that remote chains are required to be supported by the Skip Go API.
3. **Token metadata availability**: Token metadata must be available in a commonly used chain registry (e.g., Cosmos Chain Registry) for successful transfers.

Overall, this chunk provides an overview of potential failure points and best practices for cross-chain asset transfers using the Skip Go API, while also highlighting the importance of supporting multiple chains and remote chains.
