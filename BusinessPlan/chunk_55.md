## Chunk 55

**Original Text:**

Token holders will have the ability to
propose and vote on changes to the nRide Protocol and the company's future direction. nRide's
co-founders will continue to play an important role in shaping the company's vision and strategy, but their
decision-making authority will be subject to the will of the DAO. Operations
We manage and operate our DAO on DaoDao, a DAO management platform on the Juno Network, that
allows stakeholders to propose and vote on changes to the network's protocols. The proposal submission
and approval process is as follows:
1. Identify the problem or opportunity: The first step is to identify an issue or opportunity in the
nRide protocol or ecosystem that needs addressing.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that nRide is implementing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model, where token holders can participate in decision-making and propose changes to the protocol.

To summarize, the ability for token holders to propose and vote on changes to the nRide Protocol and the company's future direction will be available through the DAO management platform on DaoDao. The co-founders' role will continue to play a significant part in shaping the company's vision and strategy.

Here are some key points related to this capability:

* Token holders can identify issues or opportunities that need addressing.
* A proposal submission process will be established, allowing token holders to propose changes to the protocol.
* The proposal process will involve an approval mechanism, where token holders will vote on whether to approve the proposed change.
* As of now, the co-founders' decision-making authority is still subject to the will of the DAO (DAO management platform on DaoDao), indicating that their input may be considered but not necessarily guaranteed.
