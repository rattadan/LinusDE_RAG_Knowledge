## Chunk 54

**Original Text:**

The nRide Protocol and
DAO were created by its two co-founders, Martin Arrivets and Oluwadare Sobande. While the
co-founders currently hold the key decision-making authority, they aim to gradually transfer this power to
the nRide community as more people join the DAO. As the nRide community grows, the company's
decision-making process will become increasingly democratized. Token holders will have the ability to
propose and vote on changes to the nRide Protocol and the company's future direction. nRide's
co-founders will continue to play an important role in shaping the company's vision and strategy, but their
decision-making authority will be subject to the will of the DAO.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that you're providing a brief overview of the nRide Protocol and DAO, including how they were created by Martin Arrivets and Oluwadare Sobande, as well as their current development path.

From what you've shared, it seems that:

* The nRide Protocol is an open-source software framework designed to facilitate decentralized applications.
* The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a type of autonomous organization that allows individuals to collectively own and operate a business or project.
* The protocol aims to be more accessible and participatory, with token holders having the ability to propose and vote on changes to the protocol and company's direction.
* Co-founders Martin Arrivets and Oluwadare Sobande currently hold key decision-making authority, but this will gradually shift to a more decentralized model as the DAO grows.

Overall, it seems that nRide is moving towards a more democratized decision-making process, where token holders have a greater voice in shaping the company's direction.
