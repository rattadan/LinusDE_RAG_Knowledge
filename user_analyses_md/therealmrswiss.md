Putting this tweet into bigger context:
This tweet suggests that the author frequently observes blockchain projects being developed primarily for the sake of being on blockchain without offering any meaningful real-world application. By pointing out that having real-world utility is "what a concept," they're implying that unfortunately, many blockchain apps lack this basic quality. This critical perspective likely extends to other aspects of the blockchain space, where the author distinguishes between genuine innovation and projects that are simply trying to cash in on blockchain hype without providing value.
