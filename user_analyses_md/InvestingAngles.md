# User Analysis: InvestingAngles

## Overview

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze these tweets step by step. Let me start by looking at each one to see what the main topics are. The first tweet mentions $GDX and $GDXJ with a mid-term forecast, so that's about gold miners. The second talks about TLT's weekly analysis and mentions US10Y, so it's related to the US 10-year treasury and bond yields. The third is another TLT weekly.

Then there's a tweet about ASX, FTSE, SSE, and HSI indices closing bearish, so that's global markets and indices. The fifth tweet is about MU with some Elliott Wave analysis, which is a technical analysis method. The next one mentions ABC, WXY wave patterns and GLTA, which is another Elliot Wave term. The seventh discusses $SPY, $QQQ, $DIA, and Bearish Engulfing patterns in candlestick charts. The eighth is a list of various financial instruments like VIX, DXY, USDJPY, TLT, GDX, oil, natural gas, SP500, Nasdaq, DJIA, DJT. The ninth is about $ETH with Elliott Wave tags.

Putting this together, the main themes are technical analysis of financial markets using Elliott Wave theory, coverage of indices like S&P, Nasdaq, gold miners, treasury bonds (TLT), and some crypto like Ethereum. There's also a focus on volatility, dollar indices, and market trends.

For language style and tone: The user uses technical jargon related to Elliott Wave and candlestick patterns. The tone seems professional and educational, offering analysis rather than casual conversation. They ask for opinions, like "Team ABC or WXY?" indicating they engage with followers. The messages are concise but informative, possibly aiming to build a community around their analysis.

Legitimacy evaluation: The accounts seem legitimate as they provide consistent analysis with specific details. They mention various real financial instruments and use recognized technical terms. However, the analysis is very specialized (Elliott Wave), which might not be mainstream. Need to check if the URLs lead to genuine content. Since the image URLs are from Twitter's media, they're probably part of the account's legitimate posts. No obvious spam or scams detected here.

Ecosystem or project advertised: The account doesn't explicitly promote a specific project or ecosystem. They appear to offer market analysis, possibly their own insights or a service. The links might go to their analysis reports, but without visiting, it's hard to confirm. No clear affiliation with a specific project, but they use $ symbols for stocks and indices, so financial market analysis.

Author's character: The communication style suggests expertise in technical analysis, particularly Elliott Wave. They seem data-driven, analytical, and methodical. Motivations could be to share knowledge, build a following, or promote a subscription service. Values include transparency (providing free updates like the ETH one). Emotional patterns are neutral, focused on strategy. Their decision-making is based on structured analysis frameworks rather than impulsive thoughts. They present scenarios (like MU's price paths) and invite discussion, indicating openness to varied perspectives but grounded in their methodology.

Contextualizing intentions: The tweets are part of a broader strategy to establish authority in financial market analysis, possibly to grow their audience for a paid service or affiliate marketing. By consistently providing analysis on trending instruments (like major indices and commodities), they attract traders interested in technical indicators. The use of hashtags and mentions of platforms like wsjmarkets suggests they aim for visibility and credibility within trading communities.
