**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

---------------------------------------------------------

The yields derived from swap fees, external incentives, lending, superfluid staking, etc., is owned by and sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capture. In a future upgrade there will be features to further share PoL yield rewards with users. ## What are the key requirements for submitting a bid? ---------------------------------------------------

Projects must:

Use the bid template. Ensure bids meet the Hydro committeeâ€™s guidelines, including details on liquidity usage, risk mitigation, and monitoring. ## What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid? ---------------------------------------------------------

Draft the bid using the provided template. Schedule a review meeting with the Hydro committee. Finalize the bid and convert it to Markdown. Upload the bid and tribute to the Hydro smart contract. Hydro team adds the bid to the front-end for voting. ## What happens during deployment testing?

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the text chunk:**

**1. Technical details, parameters, or processes described:** The text chunk discusses the following technical aspects:
- **Yield distribution**: The yields derived from various sources (swap fees, external incentives, lending, superfluid staking, etc.) are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment.
- **Future upgrade**: An upcoming update will include features to share PoL (Protocol-Owned Liquidity) yield rewards with users.
- **Bid submission process**: The chunk outlines the required steps for submitting a bid, including using the bid template, meeting Hydro committee guidelines, and uploading the bid and tribute to the smart contract.
- **Deployment testing**: The exchange rate of bid to markdown, adding the bid to the front-end, and adding voting.

**2. Connection to surrounding context:**
- The chunk builds upon the previous section's discussion on **APRs and Rewards** by mentioning the yield distribution process.
- The **Key Components and Processes** section, specifically **Committee Oversight**, is connected to the chunk's discussion on the Hydro committee's guidelines and review process.
- The chunk also relates to the **Bid Submissions** process, as mentioned in the **Key Components and Processes** section.

**3. Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**
- The bid must be submitted using the provided template.
- The bid must meet the Hydro committee's guidelines, including details on liquidity usage, risk mitigation, and monitoring.
- The bid submission process involves a review meeting with the Hydro committee, finalizing the bid in Markdown, uploading it to the smart contract, and adding it to the front-end for voting.
- Deployment testing is a part of the process, but the specifics are not explicitly stated.
