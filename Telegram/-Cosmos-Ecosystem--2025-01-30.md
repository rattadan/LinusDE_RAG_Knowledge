## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to go through each message and identify the important information.

Starting with the top, there's a user introducing themselves and some mentions of Dora Hacks. Then, the main messages from AnubisPhy and Asa332. AnubisPhy's message is about the Planq Airdrop. They had a first round with 10 winners, but over 20 wallets were disqualified because they were large holders. The second round will have 30 re-evaluated winners, but only those with Planqonauts NFTs in the same wallet qualify. Also, moving NFTs could disqualify them. The reward is 1 million $Anubi tokens. Selling tokens leads to disqualification, and if five people sell, the campaign ends.

Asa332 mentions the Ark Protocol launchpad live, first InterChain NFT launch on Jan 31st at 8 AM UTC on Neutron. Other phases and public mint on all chains. There's a link to the announcement.

Then there's a message from dorahacksofficial about Round 5 of the AEZ Quadratic Grant. Funding pool is 8k ATOM and 31k USDC. Two participation methods: Quadratic Funding with ATOM contributions needing IBC transfer, and MACI Voting for ATOM stakers with gas fees covered. They back public goods and appchain projects in Cosmos. Applications for Round 6 are open.

Forthex talks about Castrum wallet release for Planq Network with download links and a request to share their tweet.

wlkatja mentions the last day to register for Agentic Ethereum, with links to resources for builders. Also, a Twitter Space link.

I need to group these by topic. The main topics are Planq Airdrop, Ark Protocol Launch, AEZ Grant Round 5, Castrum Wallet, and Agentic Ethereum registration. The new user and Dora Hacks mentions are probably less critical unless they relate to decisions.

For each section, extract key points: milestones, eligibility, deadlines, rewards, rules. Also note any links or important dates. Avoid redundancy, like the repeated Dora Hacks messages. Check if any decisions are made, like the disqualification in Planq, the launch date for Ark,

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to parse through each message to identify recurring or significant themes.

Starting with the earliest message, there's a greeting from a new user, which probably isn't a main topic. Then, mentions of DoraHacks and creating a topic about them. The next few messages talk about an Airdrop from Planq, Ark Protocol's launchpad for NFTs, and Cosmos ecosystem activities. 

Looking at the details, the Planq Airdrop has several parts: the first round results, the second round with NFT eligibility, token concentration dilution, and disqualification rules. Ark Protocol's launchpad is about an InterChain NFT launch, with specific dates and links. DoraHacks is mentioned multiple times in relation to the AEZ Quadratic Grant Program, Round 5 voting, funding pools, participation methods, and project support. 

Other mentions include Twitter Spaces by Sputnik Network and Mad Scientists, and the $WHALEx token being tradable on WhiteWhale. Later messages mention Agentic Ethereum registration deadline and Castrum wallet launch. 

I should extract each unique topic. DoraHacks and AEZ Quadratic Grant Program are definitely key. The Planq Airdrop, Ark Protocol's InterChain NFT, Cosmos ecosystem, Castrum wallet, Agentic Ethereum hackathon, and Twitter Spaces. Also, terms like liquidity providers, token concentration, NFT eligibility, and public goods funding come up but might be part of broader topics. 

Need to ensure that each main topic is concise and not overlapping. For example, "Planq Airdrop" covers the rounds and eligibility. "Ark Protocol Launchpad" includes the InterChain NFT launch. "DoraHacks" is already covered with the AEZ grant. "Castrum Wallet" is separate. "Agentic Ethereum" and "Twitter Spaces" are distinct. 

Double-checking for any other mentions: $WHALEx on WhiteWhale, but that might be a secondary detail. The user might want the primary topics. So the main ones are: DoraHacks, AEZ Quadratic Grant Program, Planq Airdrop, Ark Protocol Launchpad, Cosmos Ecosystem, Castrum Wallet, Agentic Ethereum, Twitter Spaces. 

Wait, the AEZ Quadratic Grant

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. The text is a series of chat messages from different users, mostly related to blockchain projects like Dora Hacks, Planq Community, Ark Protocol, and others.

First, the user_7164487109 introduces themselves, saying "Hello everyone, I'm new here" and "Nice to meet you all." That's definitely positive, friendly, and welcoming. The sentiment here is positive.

Then there are some messages from unknown users mentioning Dora Hacks and tagging the official account. They seem neutral because they're just stating facts or announcing topics without expressing strong emotions.

AnubisPhy's message is about concluding an airdrop round, selecting winners, and explaining eligibility for the next round. They use words like "thrilled," "excited," "impressive," and emphasize community building. The tone is positive, highlighting achievements and future plans.

Asa332 shares a link about the Ark Protocol launchpad and mentions the first InterChain NFT launch. They also include links and announcements. The sentiment here is neutral to slightly positive, as it's informative but doesn't have strong emotional language.

Another message from Asa332 just shares a link, which is neutral.

dorahacksofficial has two messages, both similar, announcing Round 5 of the AEZ Quadratic Grant Program. They use bold text and emojis like üåü, and phrases like "long-term program supporting," "innovative projects," and encourage participation. The sentiment is positive, promoting engagement and support.

rcjulin_ForkDAO says "Hi all the cosmos üßâüí™ü´Çüí°" with emojis indicating positivity and enthusiasm, so that's positive.

wlkatja has a message about a live Twitter Space and another from unknown users about a Twitter Space, both including links. These are neutral as they're just sharing information.

zicha110001 starts with "GM @everyone" which is a common greeting in crypto communities (Good Morning), mentions $WHALEx being tradable, and provides links. The sentiment is positive, sharing good news and opportunities.

wlkatja's later message includes important links and deadlines for a hackathon. It's informative but has some emphasis with bold text and mentions it's the last day

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any specific tasks, deadlines, or decisions made.

Starting with the first few messages, there's a new user introducing themselves and some mentions of DoraHacks. The unknown user mentions creating a topic about Dora Hacks and that @dorahacksofficial represents them. Not sure if there's an action item here, maybe just setting up a topic, but no specific task assigned.

Then, AnubisPhy's message about the Airdrop for liquidity providers. They mention the second round starting, 30 winners re-evaluated, eligibility with Planqonauts NFTs. The action items here would be: holders shouldn't move their NFTs to avoid disqualification, and the team can guide those wanting to trade NFTs. Also, the reward distribution of 1 million tokens. The rules about not selling tokens to stay eligible are important decisions.

Asa332 talks about the Ark Protocol launchpad live, first NFT launch on Jan 31st. The next steps here are the dates and phases for the launch. Phase 1 starts on Neutron on Friday, so that's a deadline. Also, links provided for participation and announcements. Users need to check those links for WL phases and public mint.

Another message from wlkatja about the last day to register for Agentic Ethereum. Important links provided for builders, including office hours, GitHub repos, docs, and npm packages. The key action item here is the deadline to register today. They also mention waiting for updated docs and the Agent Kit to be released later.

Forthex announces the Castrum wallet release. Users should download it for Android or iOS, and like/share a tweet. So next steps are downloading the wallet and promoting it via social media.

Dorahacksofficial repeats the info about Round 5 of the AEZ Quadratic Grant. They list participation methods with deadlines until Feb 3. Also, applying for Round 6 is possible. Action items include contributing to projects via Quadratic Funding or MACI Voting, checking the guide, and applying for the next round.

I need to make sure I don't miss any deadlines or specific tasks. Also, check if any messages are duplicates. For example,
