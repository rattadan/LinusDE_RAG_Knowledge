## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 2

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Dynamic ridesharing (DRS) or ride-pooling of trips can significantly improve system performance by
lowering empty vehicle-miles traveled (eVMT) and increasing average vehicle occupancy
(AVO). With several cities looking to promote efficient curb space use, especially with the use
of pickup and drop-off locations (PUDOs), this study explores the impacts of PUDOs on DRS
rates and AVO values. Various PUDO spacings and trip-demand densities were studied, across
the Bloomington, Illinois region, using the agent-based simulator POLARIS. Results reveal that
greater PUDO spacing or distances between stops and higher levels of SAV use or trip demand
increase AVO (by up to 0.2 travelers per 4-seater SAV, on average) and decrease SAV VMT (by
up to 27%) compared to door-to-door SAV fleet operations without DRS or PUDOs. A quartermile PUDO spacing is recommended in downtown regions, similar to current transit stop spacing
design, to keep walking trips short and demand relatively high.
