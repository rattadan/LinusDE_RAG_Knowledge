**Original Text:**

The first one is that public transport systems need to be easy to understand, achieved by having regular
and fixed operation rules. The second reason is that gathering passengers together triggers scale economies, allowing the system to
provide higher frequencies (Mohring, 1972; Jansson, 1980) and more direct routes (Fielbaum et al., 2020; Cats et al., 2020). These first
and second reasons do not apply to ridesharing systems, as there are no such things as frequencies or routes. The third reason deals with
diminishing the traveling times for the vehicles and users, which is achieved in three different ways:
1. Some streets have special infrastructure that prioritizes transit vehicles. Transit lines and stops tend to accumulate in those streets. An extreme case for this is the so-called BRT (Bus-Rapid-Transit) system that have been built in many cities worldwide (Deng and

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk describes the technical details, parameters, or processes related to optimizing transportation systems for efficiency and user satisfaction.

Here's a breakdown of what this section is explaining:

1. **Technical details:** The text discusses various mathematical modeling approaches used in ridesharing systems, such as:
	* Mathematical decomposition methods (e.g., Zhao et al.'s 2018 paper) that break down complex optimization problems into smaller, more manageable parts.
	* Simulation techniques (e.g., Vosooghi et al. 2020's focus on shared autonomous vehicle simulation and service design) used to analyze system performance.
2. **Parameters or processes:** The text mentions specific parameters and processes related to ridesharing systems, such as:
	* Meeting points: the concept of gathering passengers together triggers scale economies in ridesharing systems.
	* Vehicle rebalancing: a process aimed at reducing travel times for vehicles by optimizing their route and schedule.

In terms of context, this chunk is building upon the surrounding discussion of various themes related to ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems. The specific topic of meeting points is highlighted as a crucial factor in improving efficiency and user satisfaction in these systems.

The technical details discussed in this section are also relevant to the broader goals of optimizing transportation systems, which include reducing travel times, increasing frequencies, and minimizing costs.

Conditions and constraints mentioned:

* None mentioned specifically in this text chunk.
* However, it is implied that ridesharing systems require efficient use of resources (e.g., vehicles, infrastructure), as well as a high level of user satisfaction and efficiency. This may limit the scope of possible solutions or approaches discussed in this section.

By focusing on technical details and parameters related to optimizing transportation systems for efficiency and user satisfaction, this chunk provides insight into the mathematical modeling and simulation techniques used in ridesharing research.
