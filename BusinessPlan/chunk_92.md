## Chunk 92

**Original Text:**

There is a risk that users dismiss nRide because it
uses this technology. The nRide team can reduce this risk by communicating
clearly, in the company blog and social media, about how and
why it uses blockchain as a technological enabler of
decentralisation. nRide is focusing on building and releasing
a product, not on building hype and organising a token sale to
raise more money than needed. The stamp of approval from
IUK would also increase confidence. 26

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The text mentions that there is a risk that users dismiss nRide because it uses blockchain technology, specifically mentioning environmental risks such as:

1. Energy consumption: The computing resources used to operate blockchains consume energy, which can lead to environmental impacts.

This suggests that the potential negative publicity around environmental concerns related to blockchain technology may be a valid concern for the company, and that addressing these issues upfront could help mitigate this risk.
