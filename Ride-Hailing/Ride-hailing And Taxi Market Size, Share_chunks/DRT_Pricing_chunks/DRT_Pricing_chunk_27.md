## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 27

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

**Original Text:**

A comparison of the modal
shift effect for the different pricing setups reveals that without a minimum charge, most DRT users come from the
bicycle and walk mode. Without a minimum charge, for both service area setups, only a share of 4% switch from
car to DRT. Charging a minimum fee has a significant effect on the total number of DRT trips as well as the modal
shift: For a higher minimum fee, the number of users switching from bicycle and walk to the DRT mode is
drastically reduced. And instead, users switching from PT to DRT is observed to be the strongest modal shift effect. Nevertheless, even for a relatively high minimum fee, a significant share of DRT users come from the bicycle and
walk mode. The DRT service area is found to have a strong impact on the modal shift between car and DRT. In the
setup where DRT vehicles only operate inside the inner-city Berlin area, increasing the minimum fee does not increase
the share of users switching from car to DRT.
