In context:

The tweet from @0xWenMoon seems like a response to Kaito's announcement of his Virtual Yapper Leaderboard. Wen Moon might be interested in learning more about the leaderboard and how it's calculated. The mention of donating "yapping" Virgen Points with microcreators is likely an attempt by Vader Research to attract followers who are willing to engage with their content.

The other tweet from Kaito is a promotional message, likely intended for his own audience or fans. It uses humor to encourage them to follow him and potentially monetize their online presence through microtransactions (e.g., donating points).
