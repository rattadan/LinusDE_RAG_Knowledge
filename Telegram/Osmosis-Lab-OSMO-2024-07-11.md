## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this chat text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The text has multiple messages from different users, mostly discussing issues related to cryptocurrency transactions on Osmosis and other blockchain platforms. 

First, I'll go through each message to understand the context. The earliest message is from Chessmany3k asking why STatom can't be moved via IBC to Osmosis, getting a failed to fetch error. BasementNodes responds with a method involving IBC transfer. Then there's a discussion about a pool (link provided) having no incentives, with iconoicono asking about it and WorkerBee_3 confirming that only swap fees are present.

Next, there's a mention of a news article from Osmosis, but user_7164487109 is upset because there's no pump despite the news. Svansy and WorkerBee_3 then discuss a UI issue with certain tokens showing incorrect values, specifically high integer counts causing problems. They mention that USDC is fine, but other shitcoins with large token amounts have issues. BasementNodes points out that large exponents are problematic. 

Svansy also talks about a new auto-tx feature with a time limit, and WorkerBee_3 explains that you can set limits and sign transactions for up to 2 hours. There's a mention of multiple wallet approval and a user only approving with one. 

Then, there's a part where Svansy is having trouble with USDC becoming worthless, but WorkerBee_3 says it's still $1 on CoinGecko. They discuss possible router issues and manually controlling pool routes. Later, Svansy mentions saving some bottlecaps, and others talk about inflation reports and unrelated topics like WW3 starting. 

Looking at the key points: issues with IBC transfers for STatom, lack of incentives in a specific pool, UI displaying incorrect values for tokens with high integers, problems with Solana to Cosmos transfers (CCTP), high Solana gas fees, and the new auto-tx feature. Decisions include submitting the UI issue to devs, suggesting using IBC transfer method, and manually controlling pool routes as troubleshooting steps.

I should structure the summary to highlight these issues and the actions taken or suggested. Make sure to mention the main participants and the outcomes. Avoid minor details like the inflation report or unrelated jokes unless they're part

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and see what they're talking about.

Looking at the text, there are several mentions of Osmosis, like "osmo/shitcoin" and "app.osmosis.zone". So Osmosis is definitely a topic. Then there's a lot about token swaps and issues with the UI showing incorrect values, like "weird worth" and "huge amounts of tokens". That seems related to problems with token swaps on the platform.

Another recurring theme is IBC transfers, specifically with STatom and moving USDC from Solana to Cosmos. Users are having errors and discussing alternatives like cctp.money and ibc.fun. So IBC transfer issues and cross-chain transfers between Solana and Cosmos are topics here.

There's mention of high integer counts for tokens, which might relate to decimal precision or tokenomics. Also, some users talk about manual pool routing and router issues, suggesting that pool routing is a topic. They mention swap fees and incentives, like "no additional incentives" and "swap fees", so that's another topic.

Solana gas fees come up, with users complaining about high costs and failed transactions. Then there's a link to a news article and a support site, so news and support resources might be topics. Lastly, there's a question about a specific pool (pool/1057) and some unrelated messages like "BPOB" and "inflation report", but those might be less central.

I should compile all these into a list, making sure they're concise and not overlapping. Let me check again to ensure I didn't miss any. The main points are Osmosis, token swaps, IBC transfers, Solana to Cosmos transfers, UI issues, high token integers, pool routing, swap fees, incentives, Solana gas fees, news, and support. That should cover the primary topics discussed in the chat.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this chat. Let me start by reading through all the messages. 

First, looking at the earliest messages. There's a user asking about moving USDC from Solana to Cosmos with good liquidity and if there are issues with CCTP today. Another user mentions Solana gas being expensive after 10 attempts, costing $5 and causing a headache. They also mention trying to swap shitcoins with high integers and problems with the UI showing weird worth. There's a lot of technical discussion about blockchain issues, like IBC transfers failing, relayer problems, and integer counts causing confusion.

Then, there's a message about an inflation report coming in good and saving bottlecaps, which seems positive. But most of the conversation revolves around technical problems: UI inaccuracies, failed transactions, high gas fees, pool incentives, and routing issues. Users are troubleshooting and discussing bugs or limitations in the system. Some are frustrated, like "my USDC is worthless" and "this hurts my eye," indicating negative sentiment. Others are neutral, asking questions or providing solutions. 

There are a few positive notes, like liking the auto-tx idea and the app, but the majority of the messages are about problems they're encountering. Phrases like "nah the ones with large exponent are always problematic" and "failed to fetch error" lean negative. The user_7164487109 is upset about no pump despite news. 

I should categorize each message. The technical issues and complaints about costs and failures are negative. Neutral parts are factual questions or statements without clear emotion. Positive ones are rare but present. Overall, the sentiment seems more negative because of the recurring problems and frustrations expressed.
</think>

The sentiment of this text is **negative**. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Technical Issues & Frustration**: Multiple users report problems with blockchain transactions (e.g., failed IBC transfers, high Solana gas fees, UI inaccuracies). Phrases like "huge amounts of tokens," "weird worth," "failed to fetch error," and "solana gas so expensive" indicate dissatisfaction and confusion.
2. **Criticism of Tools/Platforms**: Complaints about relayers, frontends, and pool incentives (e.g., "cctp.money not so much," "looking at this hurts my eye") suggest frustration with existing tools.
3. **Neutral/Positive Elements**: A few

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat. The user wants me to extract any such things, so I need to go through each message and see what people are planning to do or have decided.

Starting from the latest message: Svansy is asking if there are issues with CCTP today. Then they mention trying to move USDC from Solana to Cosmos with good liquidity. Another user, martyvb, talks about IBC.fun working great but CCTP.money not so much, and mentions relayer problems and fees. Svansy tried and had issues, then after 10 attempts it worked but with high gas. Then BasementNodes suggests using IBC transfer for now. 

Chessmany3k is having a failed to fetch error with STatom on IBC. BasementNodes asks if it's just one of them, maybe referring to the pool or token. Then there's a user asking about BPOB, but it's unclear. Later, Svansy mentions that auto-tx for a time limit is new, and WorkerBee_3 explains that you can sign a transaction for 2 hours. Svansy says they only approve with one wallet, and WorkerBee_3 suggests using multiple wallet approvals. They also discuss manually controlling the pool route for a router issue. 

Svansy points out that the UI shows a weird worth for some coins, and WorkerBee_3 is going to submit to devs. BasementNodes mentions coins with large exponents being problematic, and Svansy notes that high integer counts (tokens with huge amounts) are the issue. Mikebarb can't replicate the problem, and Svansy says USDC is fine but the UI is the problem. 

Earlier messages talk about inflation reports, bottlecaps saved, news links, and a pool without incentives. Iconoicono asks about incentives for pool 1057, and WorkerBee_3 says only swap fees. Osmosis_news shares a link, and someone else mentions a failed transaction. 

Putting this all together, the main action items would be:

1. WorkerBee_3 will submit the UI issue to the developers.
2. Svansy and others are advised to manually control the pool route as a workaround.
3. BasementNodes suggests using IBC transfer method for moving tokens.
4. Iconoicono's question about incentives is answered,
