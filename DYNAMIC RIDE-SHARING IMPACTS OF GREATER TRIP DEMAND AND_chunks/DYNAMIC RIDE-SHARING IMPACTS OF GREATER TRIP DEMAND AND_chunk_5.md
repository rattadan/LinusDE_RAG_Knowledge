## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 5

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

(2019) estimated an increase in VMT of about 47% from
demand shifts once shared AVs (SAVs) are available, after accounting for induced mode use. Availability of personal AVs, on the other hand, may increase household VMT by up to about
80%, according to Harb et al. (2018). Transit ridership may also be affected, with studies
predicting transit being the key market for mode shifts to low-cost convenient SAVs (Hall et al.,
2018; Reck and Axhausen, 2020; Gurumurthy et al., 2020c), and congestion will rise without a
sustainable alternative to high-occupancy transit vehicles. Without ride-pooling or dynamic ridesharing (DRS) among strangers while en route, SAV use is likely to further increase congestion
from added, unoccupied travel or empty vehicle-miles traveled (eVMT). If SAVs continue to
operate like present-day TNCs combined with higher demand, curbside congestion from multiple
pickups and drop-offs on busy downtown blocks is an additional concern.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The current text chunk discusses the estimated increase in Vehicle-to-Motor Traffic (VMT) due to the adoption of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs).
* VMT is defined as the total distance traveled by all road users, including passengers and freight.
* The estimates provided refer to changes in VMT:
	+ A 47% increase in demand shifts once SAVs are available for personal use.
	+ An estimated 80% increase in household VMT due to the availability of personal SAVs.

**Connections to or Building Upon Surrounding Context:**

The current text chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing a specific and technical analysis of the potential impacts of shared autonomous vehicles on urban transportation systems. It connects to the broader discussion about shared autonomous vehicles, consumer preferences, and operational strategies, as mentioned in the provided document context.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

* The references listed appear to be academic articles and reports that are relevant to discussing the impact of shared autonomous vehicles on urban transportation systems.
* The timeframe (2014-2020) suggests that the authors' work may not have been directly influenced by current developments in the field but rather reflects a more recent perspective.
* There is no explicit requirement or condition mentioned in the text chunk, but it assumes access to external references and expertise in the field.
