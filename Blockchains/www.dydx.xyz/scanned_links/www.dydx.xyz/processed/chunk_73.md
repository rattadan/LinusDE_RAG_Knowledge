It's also common for cryptocurrency companies to invest in advertising to capitalize on the pervasive bullish sentiment. For example, the exchangeCrypto.combought the naming rights for LAâs former Staples Center during the 2021 cryptocurrency bull run.Â
- Higher trading volume on exchanges:Volume measures how many times a cryptocurrency trades between buyers and sellers each day on an exchange. Since more people are rushing into the market during a bull run, it's common to see average trading volumes rise throughout the crypto ecosystem.Â
- Stronger trader confidence and riskier decisions:Generally, traders are willing to move away from established cryptocurrencies like BTC during bull runs to search for new profitable opportunities in lesser-known projects. For instance, in the 2017â2018 crypto bull run, Bitcoin's percentage of the total crypto market (called âBTC dominanceâ)fell from 95% to 37%, indicating more people took profits from BTC to trade in altcoins. It's also common for Alternative.me's "Crypto Fear & Greed Index" to stay in the "greed" category during bull markets. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index analyzes daily cryptocurrency trading activity, price volatility, and social media sentiment to determine how traders feel about the current market conditions. That said, these factors may be overtaken by negative developments in the crypto space, which can turn a bull market very quickly.Â
