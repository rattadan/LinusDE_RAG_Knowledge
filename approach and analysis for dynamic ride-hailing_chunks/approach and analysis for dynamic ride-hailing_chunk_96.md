I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

â€¢ In our experiments, using well-designed repositioning approaches
improved the service rate much more, in relative terms, for
smaller fleets compared to larger fleets. This was observed for
all demand-supply-ratios and especially for shorter maximum
waiting times. The intuitive reasoning behind this is that for a
given service area size and a random distribution of vehicles, the
average distance of a random customer location to its nearest vehicle is much bigger when fewer vehicles are used. Consequently,
a randomly distributed, small fleet struggles more than a large
fleet to reach customers in time, and therefore benefits more
from a clever repositioning strategy. In contrast, when the waiting
time was not limited but to be minimized, larger fleets benefited
more from the repositioning, especially when the demand-supplyratio was high.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details behind dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies in ride-hailing systems.

**Technical Details:**

1. The context of the study is a real-world scenario where small fleets are more beneficial for service rate improvements compared to larger fleets.
2. The approach involves using well-designed repositioning strategies that take into account the distribution of vehicles in the system.
3. A key insight is that the average distance between a customer's location and its nearest vehicle is significantly greater when fewer vehicles are used, which makes it more challenging for small fleets to reach customers on time.

**Context:**

The section builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Identifying the topic of ride-hailing systems and their challenges in terms of demand-supply ratios and waiting times.
2. Mentioning that the current study focuses on dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies, which is a specific area of research within this broader topic.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

None explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that:

1. The study requires access to real-world data or simulations to analyze the effects of fleet size and dynamic dispatch strategies.
2. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of repositioning strategies in improving service rates for smaller fleets compared to larger ones.

Overall, this section provides a technical explanation of how dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies can be used to improve service rate in ride-hailing systems, particularly when dealing with limited demand-supply ratios and short waiting times.
