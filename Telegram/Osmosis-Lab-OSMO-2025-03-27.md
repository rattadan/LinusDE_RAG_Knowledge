## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions.

First, the main event is Yusungsang's proposal that Osmosis becomes a Bitcoin Security Network by integrating Babylon. That's a big deal because it ties Osmosis to Bitcoin's security and positions it as a top trading venue for Babylon assets. The Bitmosis initiative is mentioned here, so I should note that alignment.

Then there's Osmogovbot reposting JohnnyWyles' post about the proposal. The support site link from Osmsis_statbot is probably just a resource, but not a key point. 

Discussions about Swapkit: talsi123 asks about the integration date, and Davidjgoosey says it's early talks, no confirmation, not near future. Jasbanza mentions no public info yet. So the key point here is uncertainty and early stages.

The CosmosRescue part: WriteCorrectlyDotCom had an account hacked, is working with CosmosRescue who need the seed phrase to help. BasementNodes and Moonz_9 confirm CosmosRescue is legit. So the key points here are the security incident and the community's trust in CosmosRescue.

Other messages like Czarcas7ic talking about exercise and the UI preferences for token deposits don't seem relevant to the main topics. I'll skip those.

Need to structure the summary around the proposal, Swapkit integration status, and the security incident with CosmosRescue. Keep it clear and to the point without extra details.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Osmosis Proposal**: Yusungsang advocates for Osmosis to become a Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN) via Babylon integration, enhancing security and positioning Osmosis as a hub for Bitcoin-related assets (aligned with the Bitmosis initiative).  
2. **Swapkit Integration**:  
   - Unconfirmed and in early discussions (davidjgoosey).  
   - Expected to boost trading volume alongside Polaris, though no timeline is provided.  
3. **Security Incident**:  
   - A user‚Äôs Keplr account was compromised due to a hacked computer; unstaked Akash tokens are recoverable in weeks.  
   - CosmosRescue (trusted by community members) is assisting but requires the user‚Äôs seed phrase to proceed.  
4. **UI Feedback**: Users request Osmosis to

- **00:51** @Czarcas7ic: Second exercise, makes me an entirely different person. Just got to set a routine and stick to it
- **02:40** @arlai_mk: hey team! Does anyone know how to configure (if possible) so that when depositing some tokens on ...
- **02:43** @mikebarb: I'm not sure if there's a way to permanently set it to default with token amount
- **02:52** @moonz_9: I think the amount of tokens makes way more sense here.
- **02:53** @moonz_9: Weird that it's not the default.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects discussed.

Starting with Yusungsang's first message: "Osmosis to Become a Bitcoin Security Network" and mentions Pros and Cons of Osmosis if the proposal passes. So that's about Osmosis integrating Bitcoin security, probably the main topic here is the proposal for Osmosis to become a Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN) using Babylon. Then there's a link and a mention of likes and retweets, but those might not be topics.

Next, osmosis_statbot's message is just a support link, so maybe not a topic. Then osmogovbot quotes JohnnyWyles talking about the same proposal, integrating Babylon, Bitmosis initiative, and Osmosis as a trading venue for Babylon assets. So that reinforces the BSN and Babylon integration as a main topic.

jasbanza mentions an interchain swaprouter with Thorchain support. So Thorchain integration or swaprouter could be another topic. The user_1746142216 asks about Swapkit, and davidjgoosey responds that there's no public knowledge yet but mentions discussions with Swapkit. Then talsi123 asks about the timeline for Swapkit integration and Polaris. So Swapkit integration is another topic here.

There's also the part where WriteCorrectlyDotCom talks about a compromised Keplr account and mentions CosmosRescue. BasementNodes and others confirm CosmosRescue's legitimacy. So security issues, account compromise, and CosmosRescue as a support entity are topics.

Then arlai_mk, moonz_9, mikebarb are discussing the Osmosis frontend defaulting to $ value instead of token amount when depositing. So user interface preferences or token amount vs. fiat value settings in Osmosis could be another topic.

Lastly, Czarcas7ic talks about exercise and routine, which seems unrelated to the main discussions about Osmosis, Bitcoin, etc. Maybe that's a separate topic but perhaps not relevant here? The user might want only topics related to the main discussions.

Putting it all together, the main topics are:

1. Osmosis becoming a Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN) via Babylon integration.
2. Pros

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different users and times, all related to Osmosis and some proposal about becoming a Bitcoin Security Network. They want me to determine the overall sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with Yusungsang's post. He's sharing a link about Osmosis becoming a Bitcoin Security Network and asks for pros and cons. Then he adds heart and butterfly emojis with "retweets are love." Emojis like ‚ù§Ô∏è and ü¶ã usually indicate positive sentiment. The fact that he's asking for pros and cons might seem neutral, but the emojis suggest he's supportive, so maybe positive.

Next, osmosis_statbot's message is just a support link. That's neutral, no opinion there.

Then osmogovbot quotes JohnnyWyles talking about the proposal integrating Babylon, leveraging Bitcoin security, and aligning with Bitmosis. The language here seems positive, highlighting benefits. So that's a positive message.

jasbanza mentions an interchain swaprouter with Thorchain support. Thorchain is another blockchain project, so supporting it might be seen as a positive development, indicating expansion or collaboration. Positive.

moonz_9 says "They're good people." Referring to someone positively, so that's a positive sentiment.

BasementNodes has two messages. The first is stating it's @CosmosRescue, and the second confirms that CosmosRescue is legitimate. Both are neutral in tone, just providing information, but the second one could be slightly positive as it's affirming legitimacy.

user_1746142216 asks "Whats swapkit?" That's a neutral question seeking information.

davidjgoosey has two messages. The first says "Fingers crossed though ü§û" which is hopeful, so positive. The second mentions discussions with Swapkit are early and nothing confirmed, which is neutral because it's stating facts without clear positive or negative words.

jasbanza again responds to a question, saying there's no public knowledge and tags davidjgoosey. Neutral.

talsi123 is asking about a timeline for Swapkit integration mentioned by Sunny. The message includes a hopeful note about volume increasing, but the question itself is neutral. However, mentioning that "Polaris needs some time" might indicate some impatience

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any parts that indicate something needs to be done, a decision was made, or a next step is mentioned.

Starting with Yusungsang's message from 2025-03-27T22:48:39: They're talking about a proposal for Osmosis to become a Bitcoin Security Network, mentioning pros and cons. They also ask for likes and retweets. The action item here might be promoting the proposal via social media engagement. Then there's a link to a status, but that's more informational than an action item.

Next, osmosis_statbot's message points users to the support site. The action item here is just directing users to seek help there, so maybe "Visit official support site for assistance" would be relevant.

Looking at osmogovbot's message: JohnnyWyles posted a proposal on the forum about integrating Babylon to make Osmosis a Bitcoin Secured Network. This is a decision or next step related to the proposal. The key points are integrating Babylon as part of a future upgrade and positioning Osmosis as the preferred venue for Babylon assets. So the action item here is the proposal to integrate Babylon for BSN.

Then jasbanza mentions an interchain swaprouter with Thorchain support. That's a feature or project, so maybe a next step is developing or implementing that.

The messages from BasementNodes and user_1746142216 discuss CosmosRescue and Swapkit. The user_1746142216 is asking about Swapkit, and BasementNodes confirms CosmosRescue is legitimate. Not sure if there's an action item here except maybe the user considering contacting CosmosRescue, but the main thing is the mention of Swapkit integration being discussed.

davidjgoosey's messages state that the Swapkit integration is in early discussions, nothing confirmed, and unlikely soon. talsi123 asks about the timeline for Swapkit integration and Polaris. The action item here is the inquiry about the go-live date for Swapkit, which requires a response from the team.

WriteCorrectlyDotCom has a security issue and is seeking advice from CosmosRescue, needing to provide a seed phrase.
