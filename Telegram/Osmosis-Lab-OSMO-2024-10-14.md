## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and figure out the key points and any decisions made.

Starting from the top, there's a support message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. Then a news link from osmosis_news, but it's a URL without details. Maybe note that there's a news update. 

Next, jasbanza mentions that Osmosis doesn't do listing deals. Emmie_listing from Toobit asks about contacting the team for listing and marketing. So there's an inquiry about listing, and a response that they don't do deals. 

Khuwarzmi flags a scam warning. Another statbot message repeats the support site. Then a user asks if everyone left the LP sector, indicating concerns about liquidity providers. 

Hassantge and Khuwarzmi discuss Claude vs GPT, and martyvb mentions being out of Claude questions for 72 hours. Khuwarzmi also refers to checking the doc site for the orderbook, and martyvb asks about orderbook docs. There's a mention of a GitHub repo link. 

Then there's a conversation about price feeds being messed up, with martyvb reporting an issue with STRD price in the limit order UI being wrong, leading to arbitrage. Khuwarzmi thanks Mary, so maybe Mary is part of the team addressing issues. 

Finally, crystalball0 and BasementNodes discuss token burns and max supply. BasementNodes is skeptical about burns increasing price, while crystalball0 thinks it's deflationary and good for hodlers. 

Putting this together: The main points are support links, listing inquiries, scam warning, LP concerns, orderbook docs availability, UI/price feed issues causing arbitrage, and discussions on tokenomics. Decisions might include directing to support docs, noting no listing deals, and acknowledging UI issues. Need to make sure the summary is concise, hits all key points without extra details.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Support & Documentation**: Osmosis directs users to its official support site (https://support.osmosis.zone) and documentation hub (https://docs.osmosis.zone) for resources on the AMM protocol and IBC integration. A GitHub repo for the orderbook was referenced (https://github.com/osmosis-labs/orderbook).  
2. **Listing Inquiries**: A

- **03:03** @BasementNodes: idk why people think burns will increase price
- **03:07** @crystalball0: it wont increase price but it makes the asset kinda deflationary doesn't it?

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or subjects.

Looking at the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's about visiting the support site. So "official support site" might be a topic. Then osmosis_news shares a link, which seems related to announcements or updates. The next message from jasbanza mentions that Osmosis doesn't do listing deals, so "listing deals" is a point here.

Emmie_listing is from someone at Toobit asking about contacting the team for listing and marketing. That's another topic: "listing and marketing inquiries". Khuwarzmi's message with #scamwarning clearly points to a scam warning. 

Another osmosis_statbot message talks about the documentation, so "official documentation" and "orderbook" come up. Then user_7164487109 is asking about liquidity providers (LP) leaving, so "liquidity provider activity" or "LP sector changes". 

Hassantge and Khuwarzmi discuss Claude vs GPT, which is about AI models comparison. Martyvb mentions being out of Claude questions, which relates to that. Then there's a discussion about orderbook docs, price feeds issues, and limit order UI problems. Those could be grouped under "orderbook documentation", "price feed issues", and "limit order UI discrepancies".

Kychuli reports flickering price feeds, reinforcing the price feed topic. BasementNodes and crystalball0 talk about token burns and deflationary aspects, so "token burns", "deflationary tokenomics", and "intrinsic value of token scarcity". 

Also, there's DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) into OSMO, which is an investment strategy. Polar mentions might refer to a project or feature named Polaris. 

Putting it all together, I need to ensure each topic is distinct but covers all the messages. I should avoid redundancy and group similar points. Let me list them out: official support site, Osmosis news, listing deals, listing and marketing inquiries, scam warnings, liquidity provider sector changes, AI model comparisons (Claude vs GPT), orderbook documentation, price feed issues, limit order UI discrepancies, token burns, deflationary tokenomics, intrinsic value of token scarcity,

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people related to Osmosis, which seems to be a blockchain or cryptocurrency project. I need to go through each message and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot: it's a link to their support site. That's just a neutral announcement, right? No emotion there, just providing a resource.

Next, another osmosis_statbot message linking to the official documentation. Again, neutral. They're just sharing official information.

Then there's a user, jasbanza, replying to someone else saying Osmosis doesn't do listing deals. That sounds negative because they're pointing out a limitation or maybe a refusal to engage in certain activities. But I should check the context. If they're correcting someone else's assumption, maybe it's neutral? Hmm, but the statement itself is a negative assertion about Osmosis not participating in deals.

Emmie_listing is asking about contacting someone for listing and marketing. It's a neutral inquiry, seeking information. No positive or negative sentiment here.

Khuwarzmi starts with #scamwarning. That's clearly negative. The hashtag itself is a red flag, indicating they're warning others about a potential scam.

Another osmosis_statbot message about support site‚Äîneutral again.

User_7164487109 is asking if everyone left the Osmosis LP sector, noting that there's no worthwhile LP anymore. This is a negative sentiment because they're expressing concern or disappointment about liquidity providers leaving.

Hassantge says they haven't used Claude yet, so can't give an opinion. Neutral, as it's just stating a fact about their experience.

Khuwarzmi asks which is better, Claude or GPT. Neutral, as it's a question comparing two models without expressing a preference.

Martyvb mentions being out of Claude questions for 72 hours. Maybe neutral, but could be slightly negative if they're frustrated with the service. But it's more of a factual statement about rate limits, so probably neutral.

Martyvb's next message about a repo and code being reasonable as a resource. Positive? They're agreeing that the resource is helpful, so maybe positive.

Another Khuwarzmi message about the GitHub repo and doc site. Neutral, as they're just stating where they're

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's anything that requires action or a decision made.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's more of an informational message, so no action item there. The next one is osmosis_news sharing a link to a tweet. Again, informational, not an action.

Then there's jasbanza replying to davidjgoosey that Osmosis doesn't do listing deals. That's a statement, not an action. Emmie_listing is asking who to contact for listing and marketing. That's a request for information, so maybe an action item for the team to respond or direct them to the right contact.

Khuwarzmi's message is a scam warning. Important for awareness, but not an action item unless there's a need to report or take down something. The next osmosis_statbot message is another support link, same as before.

User_7164487109 is asking about LPs leaving the sector. That's a question about the community's status, but unless there's a plan to address it, maybe not an action. Hassantge says they'll try Claude, so that's a personal next step. Khuwarzmi asks which AI is better, Claude or GPT. That's a question, but unless someone answers with a decision, not an action item.

Martyvb mentions they can't ask Claude questions for 72 hours. That's a limitation, but not an action. Then they discuss a repo and the orderbook documentation. The team might need to check if the docs are available or update them. Another message from martyvb points out an issue with the STRD price in the UI, leading to orders being filled at +10% off. This seems like a bug report, so the action item here is to investigate and fix the UI issue.

Khuwarzmi mentions checking the doc site or GitHub repo for orderbook docs. If they found the repo, maybe the team should ensure the docs are accurate. Hassantge refers to the docs link shared earlier. Martyvb again questions the orderbook docs existence, so maybe the team needs to create or update documentation.
