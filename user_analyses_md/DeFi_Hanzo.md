* The first tweet from @garlandflips is a direct attack on China trade war and the "fake" economic situation. However, this message seems to be in response to DeFi_Hanzo's earlier statements about an "alt season," which likely refers to a new wave of altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies).
* The second tweet from @DeFi_Hanzo is a prediction that 80% of investors were not prepared for the China trade war and will lose out. This message appears to be part of a larger conversation about market volatility and DeFi trends.
* The third tweet from @deadinsol is a warning that Trump's China tariffs will destroy the market, with $104,000 being the ATH (all-time high) price for Bitcoin in 2025. This message seems to be a prediction based on speculative analysis rather than concrete evidence.

Overall, the tweets and messages appear to be part of a larger DeFi community discussion about alternative cryptocurrencies, market trends, and financial analysis.
