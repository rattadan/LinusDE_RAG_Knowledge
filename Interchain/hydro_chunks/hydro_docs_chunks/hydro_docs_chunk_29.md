**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

The information needed in the project bid template is the following:

Contact details Bid Description Liquidity bucket and tranche Intended use of liquidity Conversion to desired LST (if required) Performance monitoring details Expected performance Risk mitigation details Security audits Deployment Venue Queries Tribute tokens or points during auction process

The full template can be found here. The template contains instructions on how to prepare a bid for review. ## Committee review
----------------

During Pilot Rounds, the Hydro committee is responsible for allowlisting Projects, deploying liquidity, and managing exports (future versions of Hydro will incorporate a governance module and integration with the Valence protocol built by Timewave Labs). Committee members are also responsible for maximizing returns for voters and alerting the community about unwanted behaviors and vulnerabilities. The committee has written guidelines for project pre-submissions.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Text Chunk:**

1. **Technical Details and Parameters**:

The text chunk outlines the requirements for a project bid template in Hydro. The key details include:
- Contact details: required for project communication
- Bid Description: a description of the project and liquidity requirements
- Liquidity bucket and tranche: the specific amount and type of liquidity needed
- Intended use of liquidity: the purpose of the liquidity deployment
- Conversion to desired LST (if required): the need to convert liquidity into a specific tokenized staked ATOM (LST) format
- Performance monitoring details: tracking project performance and returns
- Risk mitigation details: strategies to minimize potential risks
- Security audits: thorough review of project security measures
- Deployment Venue: the platform or venue for the liquidity deployment
- Queries: potential questions or concerns from the Hydro committee or users
- Tribute tokens or points during auction process: the distribution of tribute tokens or points during the auction process

The full template for the project bid, which includes instructions for preparation, is linked in the text.

2. **Connection to Surrounding Context**:

The text chunk explains the process of preparing a bid for Hydro's Pilot Rounds, during which the Hydro committee reviews and approves bids. The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment.

The current text chunk is connected to the surrounding context as follows:
- It builds upon the **Key Components and Processes** (Section 3 in the larger document) by explaining the project bid template and the process of submitting a bid for review by the Hydro committee.
- It expands on the **Bid Submissions** (point 7 in **Key Components and Processes**) by detailing the specific requirements for project bids.

3. **Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints**:

The text chunk outlines the specific requirements for a project bid template in Hydro, which include:
- A link to the full template for project bids, which outlines the instructions for preparing a bid.
- Adherence to the Hydro committee's guidelines for project pre-submissions.
- The need for projects to submit bid templates with the required information.

Specifically, projects must use the linked template and ensure that the bid meets the Hydro committee's guidelines. The Hydro committee will review and approve bids based on these requirements.
