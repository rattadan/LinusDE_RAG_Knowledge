## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to go through each message and identify the important parts.

Starting from the top, Metamo0n is asking for a wallet tracker that shows token quantities over time instead of dollar values. Mikebarb suggests stake.tax, but Metamo0n says downloading CSVs isn't user-friendly. Then BasementNodes mentions a link to Pulsar Finance. Later, there's a discussion about a transaction issue from bendita_Varsovia. Mikebarb and BasementNodes talk about possible Kuji node issues and Keplr sync problems. They check the transaction on different explorers, and it seems like the transaction went through but isn't showing up in Keplr. The solution suggested is to remove and readd Kuji in Keplr.

Then there's a message from osmosis_news and osmosis_statbot with links. User_6825379443 and HOSS_ibc have casual messages. KyChuli and Francomeli discuss international card purchases, with a link to a Notion site for supported countries and another link for international options. Foulahton had an error with Keplr and Ledger when depositing DYM, and GPKwee suggests using TFM. BasementNodes mentions Skip and Noble using CCTP. Cmancrypto talks about ValueRouter being Circle-backed and using CCTP, with a link. Mikebarb asks about bridges, and cmancrypto mentions wormhole, cctp.money, or skip requiring bridging through Noble first.

So the key points are:

1. Metamo0n's request for a token quantity tracker, with suggestions like stake.tax and Pulsar Finance.
2. bendita_Varsovia's transaction issue via IBC from Osmosis to Kuji, which seems to be a sync problem with Keplr. The advice is to readd Kuji in Keplr.
3. Francomeli asking about international card purchases, with links provided for supported countries and international options.
4. Foulahton's error with Keplr and Ledger when depositing DYM, suggesting using TFM.
5. Discussion about ValueRouter using Circle's CCTP, allowing direct bridging of USDC from Osmosis, and other bridges requiring Noble first.

Decisions or solutions mentioned:

- For the transaction issue: readd

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user provided a list of chat messages from different people, each with timestamps and content. My task is to go through these messages and identify the main topics, then list them separated by commas.

First, I'll start by reading through each message to understand the context. The messages mention various things like wallet trackers, token holdings, transaction issues, specific platforms like Pulsar.finance, Keplr, Osmosis, Kujira, and others. There are also references to error codes, bridges, and some support links.

Looking at the first few messages, Metamo0n is asking about a wallet tracker that shows token quantities over time instead of dollar values. They mention a YouTube link and someone else suggests stake.tax. Then there's a discussion between bendita_Varsovia and mikebarb about a pending transaction on Kujira, with links to transaction details and possible node issues. BasementNodes mentions a Kuji node problem. Later, there's a message about Osmosis News, support links, and some card activation questions. Another part talks about depositing DYM in Osmosis with a Keplr error. Then discussions about bridges like ValueRouter, Circle CCTP, Wormhole, Noble chain, etc.

So, the main topics seem to revolve around:

1. Wallet trackers and user-friendly interfaces for token holdings (quantity vs. value).
2. Transaction issues on Kujira and Osmosis, including pending transactions and node problems.
3. Error messages related to Keplr wallet and Ledger when depositing tokens.
4. Bridging tokens between chains, specifically mentioning ValueRouter, Circle CCTP, Wormhole, Skip, Noble.
5. Support and assistance links for Osmosis and other platforms.
6. Discussions about international purchases with a card linked to Osmosis.
7. Token bridges and their underlying technologies.

I need to make sure these topics are distinct and not overlapping. For example, the transaction issues and node problems might be part of the same topic. The bridge discussions are about different services and their technical aspects. Also, the card activation and international purchases are related to a specific service or feature.

Let me check again. The user wants the main topics, so I should group related issues. The first topic is about wallet trackers showing token quantity over time. Then transaction problems on specific chains. The error code 4 in Ke

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. First, I need to go through each message and figure out its sentiment. Then, I'll aggregate them to determine the overall tone.

Starting with the first message: "Metamo0n at 2024-12-11T18:47:30+00:00: Yeah not showing what im looking for". The user is expressing frustration that something isn't showing what they need. That sounds negative. Words like "not showing" and "looking for" indicate dissatisfaction.

Next, BasementNodes says, "But I think it only starts when you start it". This seems neutral. It's a statement about a process, not clearly positive or negative. Maybe a bit informative.

Then, another BasementNodes message with a link. Just sharing a link without context might be neutral unless the link is positive or negative, but since we don't have the content, it's safer to mark it neutral.

Metamo0n shares a YouTube link: "Something like this [link]". The user is providing an example, so neutral again. No strong emotion here.

Metamo0n's message "Will try üëçüèª" has a thumbs-up emoji, which is positive. They're showing willingness to try something, so that's a positive sentiment.

mikebarb says, "yeah but it does show a bar graph of token holdings". The "yeah but" structure might indicate a slight negative, but they're pointing out a feature. Maybe neutral because it's a factual statement.

Metamo0n's message: "Yeah, but not user friendly to download the csv each time." The complaint about user-friendliness suggests negative sentiment. They're frustrated with the process.

mikebarb suggests "stake.tax might allow that". Neutral, as it's a recommendation without clear emotion.

Metamo0n asks a question about a wallet tracker. The tone is inquisitive but seeking a solution, so neutral. They're looking for a feature, not necessarily upset yet.

bendita_Varsovia thanks someone: "thanks. i appreciate your help". Definitely positive. Gratitude is a clear positive indicator.

mikebarb mentions a message received in kuji. Neutral, just stating a fact.

Another mikebarb message: "Sure

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I'll read through the entire conversation to understand the context. 

Looking at the messages, there are several users discussing different issues. Metamo0n is asking about a wallet tracker that shows token quantities over time instead of dollar values. Mikebarb suggests stake.tax and mentions checking a transaction on Kuji. BasementNodes provides a link to Pulsar.finance and comments on node issues. Bendita_Varsovia has a transaction pending and is checking with Chainscope and Keplr. There's also a user asking about international purchases with a card, and another about a Keplr error when depositing DYM. Additionally, cmancrypto and BasementNodes discuss bridging options like ValueRouter and CCTP.

So, the main action items would be things people are planning to do, decisions made, or next steps to resolve issues. Let me parse each relevant message:

1. Metamo0n at 18:18: Shares a YouTube link. Not an action item.
2. Mikebarb at 17:50: Says stake.tax might allow showing token quantity. So the action item here is "Consider using stake.tax for token quantity tracking."
3. Metamo0n at 17:46: Asks about a wallet tracker for token quantity. This is a request but not an action item unless someone else responds with a solution. Mikebarb's previous message is a suggestion, so that's an action item.
4. BasementNodes at 18:25: Shares Pulsar.finance link. Maybe suggest trying it, but the user later says it's not what they want. So maybe "Check Pulsar.finance for wallet tracking features" as an action item.
5. Bendita_Varsovia's issue: They have a pending transaction. Mikebarb checks and says it was received on Kuji, but Bendita can't see it in Keplr. Mikebarb suggests removing and re-adding Kuji in Keplr. So the action item here is "Bendita_Varsovia to remove and readd Kuji chain in Keplr to resolve sync issues."
6. Foulahton has an error with Keplr and Ledger when depositing DYM. GPKwee suggests using TFM bridge. So "Foulahton to
