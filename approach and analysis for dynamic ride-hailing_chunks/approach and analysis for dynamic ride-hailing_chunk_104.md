I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

In order to overcome this issue, we use the Perlin noise (Perlin,
1985). Here, a grid is used, with all points on intersections having
a noise value of zero. A random gradient is generated for each intersection. All points between the grid intersections receive a noise
value interpolated based on the gradients of the surrounding grid
intersections. By that, a pseudo-random noise is generated where points
close to each other have similar values. The noise can be configured
regarding the amplitude (by scaling the interpolated values) as well as
regarding the frequency (by changing the size of each grid cell). Using
this approach, we create a noise factor for each estimated demand
value depending on the spatial location as well as the current time. The average unsigned noise corresponds to the configured 10%, 25%,
and 50%, while the maximum values are roughly three times as large. The noise is limited to Â±100%. Fig.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**
The technical details mentioned in this chunk include:

* Perlin noise generation using a grid with random gradients between intersection points.
* Interpolation of noise values based on surrounding grid intersections.
* Configuration options for amplitude and frequency (size) of each grid cell, which affect the generated noise.

**Contextual Connection:**
This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing an explanation for how Perlin noise is used to generate a pseudo-random noise factor in dynamic dispatch for ride-hailing systems. The context discusses simulation and modeling techniques, including those related to demand forecasting and vehicle repositioning.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

* A grid-based approach is used to generate the noise factor.
* Interpolation of noise values based on surrounding grid intersections is employed.
* Specific parameters (amplitude, frequency) are mentioned for configuring the noise factor.
* The noise factor's amplitude and maximum value limits are also specified.

The chunk provides a detailed explanation of how Perlin noise can be used to generate a pseudo-random noise factor in dynamic dispatch, which is essential for ride-hailing systems.
