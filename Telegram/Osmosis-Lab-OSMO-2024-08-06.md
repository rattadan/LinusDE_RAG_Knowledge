## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. 

First, I'll scan through the text to identify the main topics. The earliest messages are from around 10:40 AM, but the bulk of the conversation happens later, especially from 11:47 AM onwards and then in the evening around 11:50 PM.

Looking at the evening messages, there's a lot about OSMO tokens and gas fees. Svansy is frustrated that Osmosis doesn't let users use OSMO for gas fees, leading to confusion about the token's purpose. Mikebarb mentions that allowing permanent selection of gas fees (like using OSMO) is a highly requested feature. So the key point here is user demand for OSMO as a gas fee option and the project's response.

Then, there's a discussion about pools and tokens not showing up on the frontend. Svansy and others are having issues finding certain tokens in pools, and BasementNodes and mikebarb suggest checking if it's a new pool or a temporary issue. They mention possible frontend rebuilds and the need to wait. The decision here seems to be that the team is aware but needs time to resolve.

Another major topic is the problems with CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) from Solana to Noble. Svansy points out that it's broken, requiring manual relaying, and suggests using Wormhole instead. There's a mention of allUSDC being a better option. The key points here are the CCTP issues and the recommendation to use alternative bridges.

Also, there's a user (CryptoOGT) asking about trading AKT on Osmosis, and mikebarb explains the process. Then, profesija and Svansy discuss the lack of a refresh button in Keplr causing inaccurate balances, and mikebarb says he'll pass this feedback to Keplr devs.

Additionally, there's a mention of a new Transmuter v3.2 pool and some support links. But the main decisions and issues are around gas fees, token visibility in pools, CCTP problems, and Keplr balance inaccuracies.

Putting this all together, the summary should highlight the main user concerns: OSMO gas fee selection, pool token issues, CCTP bridge problems, and Keplr balance refresh. Also note the team's acknowledgment and plans to

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list.

First, I'll read through the text to understand the context. The conversation seems to be happening on a platform like Discord or Telegram, related to the Osmosis blockchain and its token, OSMO. There are mentions of gas fees, staking, and issues with transactions. 

Looking at the messages, the main topics start to emerge. The first part is about feedback on allowing permanent selection of gas fees, specifically using OSMO for gas. Users are frustrated because they bought OSMO for gas, but Osmosis doesn't let them use it easily. That's a key topic: gas fees and OSMO token usage.

Then there's a mention of staking rewards, gas fees, taker fees, and governance. These are separate but related topics in the blockchain space. So those should be individual topics.

Another recurring issue is problems with pools and token visibility on the frontend. Users can't find certain tokens in pools, which affects their ability to trade or interact. So topics like pool issues and token visibility come up.

There's also a discussion about converting tokens between chains, like AKT on Osmosis to the main chain, and using tools like CCTP, wormhole, and noble express. This points to cross-chain transfers and bridge issues. The mention of specific bridges like CCTP and Axelar adds more detail.

The user Svansy talks about the confusion around the purpose of OSMO tokens, which ties into token utility and user concerns about holding the token if it's not useful for gas. That's another topic: token utility and user retention.

Additionally, there's a mention of a new Transmuter version and governance proposals, which relates to new features and governance processes. The support chat and relayer issues are also discussed, indicating topics around support and transaction relaying.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other topics. The part about the portfolio page and withdrawing tokens might fall under cross-chain transfers. The addresses and conversion tools could be part of a broader topic on address management or cross-chain tools.

Also, the feedback on the timeline for implementing gas fee selection is mentioned, so maybe including the timeline for feature implementation. However, the user might just want the main topics without specifics like timelines unless it's a recurring point.

Putting it all together, the main topics are:

-

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- osmosis (23 mentions)
- use (15 mentions)
- can (12 mentions)
- https (12 mentions)
- gas (10 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people discussing Osmosis, a blockchain project, and their experiences with gas fees, token usage, and transaction issues.

First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The main focus seems to be on the OSMO token and gas fees. Let's start with Svansy's messages. They mention that people want to select OSMO for gas permanently, which is a positive request but the context is frustration because they can't do it now. Then they say OSMO's value went down 90% because no one uses it for gas, which is negative. They also express confusion about the token's purpose and question why they should hold it if it's not useful for gas. That's definitely negative sentiment.

Mikebarb is responding to these concerns, acknowledging that the feature is highly requested. His messages are neutral because he's just relaying information without expressing strong emotions. Then there's a mention of a trending announcement about $COOK, which is positive with emojis, but that's unrelated to the main OSMO discussion. 

Other parts talk about technical issues with pools, tokens not showing up, and problems with CCTP transfers. Users like Svansy and profesija discuss how certain bridges are broken or unreliable, leading to frustration. There's a lot of "this doesn't work" and "it's broken" which are negative. 

Some messages are neutral, like BasementNodes explaining possible frontend issues or jasbanza providing links to tools. The support bot link is neutral too. However, when users mention having to wait for relayers or transactions getting stuck, that's negative. 

The overall sentiment seems negative because the majority of the messages express dissatisfaction with Osmosis's current functionality regarding gas fees and token usage. There are a few neutral or positive points, but the dominant tone is frustration and criticism. I should make sure to note that the negative sentiment is around the OSMO token's utility and transaction reliability, while some interactions are neutral or positive, like the support links provided.

The sentiment of this text is **negative**, with some neutral and mixed elements. Here's the breakdown:

### **Negative Sentiment**:
1. **Frustration with OSMO token utility**:  
   - Svansy repeatedly criticizes the lack of practical use

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I'll need to read through all the messages carefully to identify any tasks that need to be done, decisions made, or plans for the future.

Starting from the top, Mikebarb mentions feedback about allowing permanent selection of gas fees, specifically using OSMO for gas. Svansy and others are frustrated that Osmosis doesn't let them use OSMO for gas, leading to a loss in value. They're asking when this feature will be available. So, an action item here might be to address the gas fee selection issue, maybe a feature request.

Then there's a discussion about pools not working and how to fix that. Svansy says the frontend isn't showing tokens, and BasementNodes suggests checking endpoints. Mikebarb mentions reporting to devs, so maybe a next step is to investigate the pool display issues and adjust endpoints if necessary.

Another part is about converting Bech32 addresses, where Jasbanza provides a tool. That's more of a solution provided, not an action item. Then there's a user asking about advanced IBC transfers, and Khuwarzmi points them to a guide. Again, a resource shared, not an action item.

There's a lot of talk about CCTP issues from Solana to Noble, with Svansy suggesting to use Wormhole instead and asking for allUSDC. So maybe a decision to use Wormhole temporarily or a next step to fix CCTP issues. Also, they mention relayers needing to manually mint if CCTP fails, so perhaps a support action or dev fix needed.

Regarding the Transmuter contract, there's a proposal mentioned, so maybe a next step is to review or implement that. Also, a user is having balance discrepancies in Keplr, and Mikebarb says he'll pass it along to Keplr, indicating an action item to communicate with Keplr devs.

The user sending Whale tokens to INJ and Migaloo chains with Leap wallet having issues, Mikebarb checks the tx and says it's pending, so next steps might be to wait or check with relayers. Also, the relayer clearing a tx mentioned by Khuwarzmi.

Putting this all together, the main action items are around gas fee selection, pool display issues, CCTP fixes, balance refresh in Keplr, IBC tx troubleshooting
