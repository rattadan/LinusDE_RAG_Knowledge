# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_37.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.dydx.xyz/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses the aftermath of the Mt.Gox hack, the evolution of blockchain security features (e.g., smart contracts, insurance treasuries), Ethereum's role in decentralized finance (DeFi), and the rise of NFTs and blockchain splits.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Anti-phishing codes**: Security measures to prevent phishing attacks on user wallets.  
- **Insurance treasuries**: Funds (e.g., Binance's SAFU) to compensate users in case of hacks.  
- **Smart contracts**: Self-executing contracts on blockchain that automate agreements.  
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Ethereum-based projects with vulnerabilities leading to the 2016 DAO hack.  
- **Blockchain split**: Ethereum’s fork into ETH (with smart contracts) and Ethereum Classic (without).  
- **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**: Unique digital assets used in DeFi and decentralized applications.  
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)**: Security layer to protect user accounts.  

### Implementation Details  
- **DAO hack exploit**: A vulnerability in Ethereum’s smart contracts allowed hackers to steal $60 million.  
- **Blockchain split**: Ethereum’s original chain (ETC) and new chain (ETH) were created to address the DAO issue.  
- **DeFi applications**: Smart contracts enabled decentralized services like lending, trading, and borrowing.  
- **NFTs**: Early implementations like CryptoKitties and MoonCats showcased decentralized digital ownership.  

### Related Topics  
- **Security features**: The content connects to broader documentation on blockchain security (e.g., anti-phishing, insurance treasuries).  
- **Decentralized finance (DeFi)**: The text ties to technical documentation on blockchain protocols and DeFi platforms.  
- **Smart contract vulnerabilities**: The DAO hack is a case study in blockchain security, potentially linked to other security analyses.

platform. The fallout from the Mt.Gox hack influenced future crypto exchanges and wallet developers to introduce advanced security features, such as anti-phishing codes, insurance treasuries (e.g., Binance's SAFU Fund), and two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect users' funds.

Following the Mt.Gox attack, a new project called Ethereum started to make waves in the cryptocurrency market. Launched in 2015, Ethereum differed from previous altcoins thanks to its innovative smart contract technology. Smart contracts are special blockchain-based programs that automatically execute term agreements once a set of conditions are met. Developers who use smart contracts on Ethereum don't need to rely on central authorities to approve transactions or oversee in-app activity. Inspired by Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, developers began experimenting with decentralized internet applications (aka dApps) on Ethereumâs blockchain.Â

However, Ethereum faced a major crisis in 2016 when hackers exploited a bug in the smart contract code of an Ethereum-based fund called a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO hack drainedroughly $60 millionfrom early investors in the Ethereum ecosystem. Some Ethereum developers proposed creating a new blockchain to reimburse DAO investors, while others argued any third-party intervention went against the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. Eventually, the Ethereum blockchain split into two networks: the new Ethereum (ETH) and the original Ethereum Classic (ETC) chain.Â

After the DAO hack drama, Ethereum continued to rise in significance in the cryptocurrency community. Popular cryptocurrency collectibles callednon-fungible tokens(NFTs) emerged on Ethereum with early collections, such as CryptoKitties, MoonCats, and CryptoPunks. New fields such asdecentralized finance(DeFi) began using smart contract technology to provide users with decentralized services such as trading, lending, and borrowing.
