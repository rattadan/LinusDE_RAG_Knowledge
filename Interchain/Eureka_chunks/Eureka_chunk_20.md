## Eureka - Chunk 20

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Usually, there’s just one highly-trafficked and well-relayed channel between two chains over which all assets are transferred. (In theory, there can be many because IBC is permissionless, but usually relayers are only monitoring 1 and creating more adds confusion for all parties)

If you’re launching a new token on a chain that already has a vibrant IBC ecosystem and has already issued tokens that are widely used throughout the interchain (e.g. Osmosis or Neutron), you should probably use the same channel the well-established tokens use, since relayers are most likely to support these ones. To see which channel this is, call the /v2/fungible/recommend_assets endpoint with the following values:

source_denom: A well-established token on the chain where your asset is issued (e.g. uatom)
source_chain_id: The chain_id of the chain where your asset is issued (e.g. cosmoshub-4)
dest_chain_id: The chain_id of the chain to which you want to be able to transfer your asset (e.g.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Current Text Chunk**

The provided text chunk provides a detailed overview of potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* IBC is a permissionless protocol that allows for multiple relayers to monitor transactions and create more adds, which can lead to confusion among users.
* The chunk mentions specific values such as:
	+ source_denom: Well-established token on the chain where the asset is issued (e.g. uatom)
	+ source_chain_id: Chain ID of the chain where the asset is issued (e.g. cosmoshub-4)
	+ dest_chain_id: Chain ID of the chain to which the asset is being transferred (e.g. cosmoshub-4)

**Connections and Builds upon Surrounding Context:**

* The chunk builds upon the existing understanding of cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on IBC as a potential failure point.
* It also references other related protocols such as Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol, Hyperlane, and Go Fast, which are all mentioned in previous sections of the document.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

* The chunk provides recommendations for user education (Recommendation 1), risk management (Recommendations 2 and 3), and developer best practices (Recommendations 4).
* It also notes that implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms is essential in cross-chain applications to mitigate potential failure points.

Overall, the current text chunk provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, highlighting technical details, connections with surrounding context, and requirements for mitigating these risks.
