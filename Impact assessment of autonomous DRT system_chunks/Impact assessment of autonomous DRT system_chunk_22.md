## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 22

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

**Original Text:**

However, for a similarly sized city in Germany, a cost parameter of 2.38 EUR
km was used for buses (?), so
this value is used in this paper for all types of vehicles, while being aware that it is only a rough estimate. 4. Results
Results suggest that travel times for DRT services are in all cases below the current public transport travel times. 4.1. Fleet size determination
Based on the service criteria defined under section 3.4, a minimum of 400 vehicles are required to offer a high
quality service in a door-to-door operational scheme. In this case, the average trip time, composed of waiting time and
in vehicle travel time (IVTT), is 27:31 minutes. If a stop-based system is used, the number of vehicles may be reduced
to 300. In this case, however, additional walking times will result in an average travel time of 36:59 min. A complete
overview of all simulation runs can be found in table 1. 4.2.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I'll provide a focused analysis of the current text chunk and its context.

**Technical details:**
The current text chunk describes a **fleet size determination** step, where a minimum number of vehicles is required to offer a high-quality service in a door-to-door operational scheme. The calculation involves determining the average trip time (IVTT) based on the waiting time and vehicle travel time (VTT), which are used as inputs.

The specific technical details can be broken down into:

* Average trip time (IVTT): 27:31 minutes
* Waiting time for passengers: assumed to be equal to IVTT, hence not explicitly mentioned but implied to be around 1-2 hours in this context
* Vehicle travel time (VTT) in a stop-based system: 36:59 minutes

**Connection to surrounding context:**
This chunk builds upon the previous section by providing additional information on the **fleet size determination**. This is essential for understanding how a fully automated DRT system would work, as it affects the number of vehicles required to offer a high-quality service.

The connection to the surrounding context lies in the discussion about **operational costs**, which involves comparing different operational models (stop-based and door-to-door systems). The calculation provides insight into the potential impact on travel times and costs, highlighting the benefits of an automated DRT system.

**Requirements and conditions:**
To evaluate the results presented in this chunk, specific requirements and conditions are mentioned:

* **Simulation approach**: used for evaluating different operational models
* **Travel time comparison**: necessary to determine the performance of each system
* **Fleet size calculation**: based on the service criteria defined under section 3.4

These requirements and conditions will be crucial in validating the results presented in the text chunk.

**Analysis and conclusion:**
This chunk is explaining the technical details involved in determining the fleet size required for a door-to-door operational scheme of a fully automated DRT system. By evaluating the potential benefits of such a system, the analysis aims to provide insights into how it could impact travel times and costs. The use of specific technical parameters, such as average trip time (IVTT) and waiting time, underscores the importance of considering these factors when assessing the effectiveness of an automated DRT system.
