## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 33

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Furthermore, 𝛿𝑀 should never be greater than the maximum
notification time 𝑇𝑁 , as we must ensure that every request is
considered at least once in a matching epoch. Requests that did
not receive an assignment in one matching epoch, while the next
matching epoch would be after 𝑇𝑁 , are rejected prematurely. • FCFS integration: In undersupply scenarios with more open requests than available vehicles, some of the requests will not
receive an assignment. To increase fairness, Hyland and Mahmassani (2018) modify the purely cost-based matching approach
by giving priority to earlier requests. Let us assume we have 𝑛
available vehicles but 𝑛+𝑐 (with 𝑐 > 0) open requests. In this case,
only the oldest 𝑛 open requests are considered in the matching,
resulting in an 𝑛 × 𝑛 cost matrix, while the newest 𝑐 requests
are ignored in this decision epoch. By that, it can be guaranteed
that no customer will be matched later than another one that
requested service later.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

The current text chunk discusses a specific optimization problem within ride-hailing systems:

* The key challenge is ensuring fairness and efficiency in assigning requests to available vehicles.
* The approach involves considering the order of requests (FCFS, First-Come-First-Served) to optimize the matching process.

**Contextual Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by discussing various studies, concepts, and techniques related to ride-hailing systems. It builds upon the discussion of dynamic trip-vehicle assignment, spatio-temporal demand forecasting, fleet management, and optimization-based strategies. The text also introduces the concept of fairness in matching requests with available vehicles, which is a critical aspect of ride-hailing systems.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The requirements for this chunk are:

* Ensuring fairness and efficiency in assigning requests to available vehicles.
* Considering the order of requests (FCFS) to optimize the matching process.

There are no specific constraints mentioned in the text chunk. However, it's essential to note that the context implies that the system is designed to handle undersupply scenarios with more open requests than available vehicles. In such cases, some requests may not receive an assignment due to limited vehicle availability. To address this issue, the modified purely cost-based matching approach by Hyland and Mahmassani (2018) prioritizes earlier requests, ensuring fairness in the matching process.

Overall, this chunk provides insight into a specific optimization problem within ride-hailing systems, with a focus on fairness and efficiency in assigning requests to available vehicles.
