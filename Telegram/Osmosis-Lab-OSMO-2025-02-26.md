## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the provided chat messages and identify the key points and decisions. The user wants a concise summary focusing on those elements.

Looking at the messages, there are several threads. The main ones seem to be about Osmosis pools, specifically concentrated liquidity (CL) pools, and some questions about token burns. There's also a part about using stake.tax for transaction reports and some confusion with Mars credit accounts.

Starting with CR202020's questions. They asked why their BTC/USDC pool ratio is 98% BTC and 2% USDC, and what "NEAR BOUNDS" means. Mikebarb explains that when the price moves out of the set range, tokens convert to a single asset. Users can't adjust the range but can swap BTC back to USDC to create a new position. Also, removing liquidity doesn't require a waiting period unless it's a full range with superfluid staking.

Then there's a discussion about Osmosis burning tokens. ANSOPHEAP1 asks when Osmosis will burn, and mikebarb mentions that a proposal is needed for a manual burn, and the parameters are set for a community pool/staker split. The burn will be done manually via proposal until a software upgrade includes a burn split.

Other topics include BasementNodes and KaiArne90 discussing how to look up old Osmosis pools using tools like Chainscope, GitHub repositories, and other platforms. They mention issues with stake.tax handling new features like alloyed assets and CL rewards. Also, there's a mention of Mars being confusing and credit accounts causing problems with tax software.

Key decisions here are the need for a proposal to handle token burns and the manual adjustment of pools by users when out of range. The main points are about CL pool mechanics, the implications of being out of range, and the current tools and their limitations for tracking transactions and pools.

I should structure the summary around these points, making sure to highlight the user questions, the explanations from the admin (mikebarb), and the decisions mentioned, like the manual burn proposal. Also, note the tools and the issues with tax software compatibility. Keep it concise, avoiding minor details unless they're part of a key point.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand the context of the messages. Looking through the text, it seems like a conversation taking place on a platform related to Osmosis, which I know is a decentralized exchange in the Cosmos ecosystem. The participants are discussing various aspects of liquidity pools, specifically concentrated liquidity (CL) pools.

Starting with the earliest messages, KaiArne90 is asking about looking up old Osmosis pools, like pool #700. Others mention tools and links such as chainsco.pe, Celatone, and a GitHub repository. So, one topic here is "Osmosis pool lookup tools" or something similar.

Then, there's a discussion about stake.tax and its maintenance, with jasbanza asking if it's still being updated. RoboMcGobo responds that CL rewards are working, but Alloys and Mars credit accounts are problematic. This points to topics related to "stake.tax maintenance" and "Mars credit accounts issues".

Moving on, CR202020 has questions about pool ratios (98% BTC, 2% USDC) and being "OUT OF RANGE" in their pools, leading to discussions about adjusting price ranges, rebalancing, and the implications of being out of range. So topics here would include "BTC/USDC pool ratio imbalance" and "Osmosis concentrated liquidity pool range adjustments".

Another part involves Osmosis token burns, with ANSOPHEAP1 asking when Osmosis will burn tokens, and mikebarb explaining about proposals and manual burns. That's a separate topic: "Osmosis token burn schedule and proposals".

There's also a mention of HLS (High Liquidity System?) and slippage issues by mikebarb and BasementNodes, so "HLS slippage issues" could be another topic.

Additionally, BasementNodes comments on Mars being confusing, which might relate to the Mars protocol or credit accounts, so "Mars protocol complexity" could be relevant.

Lastly, there's a thank you message from TisMeAgain to OSL (Osmosis Labs?), which might be a separate topic about their funding proposal, but since it's a single message, maybe it's not a main topic unless it's part of a recurring theme.

I need to ensure that each topic is recurring or

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of the given text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

The conversation seems to be between users and support or community members on Osmosis, a blockchain platform. There are several questions about technical aspects like pool ranges, liquidity removal, and token burns. 

First, looking at CR202020's messages. They ask about "NEAR BOUNDS" and why their BTC/USDC ratio is 98/2. Then they mention their pools are out of range and ask about removing liquidity and a 7-day waiting period. They also ask if they can get back in range immediately. These are questions indicating confusion or issues they're facing. Mikebarb responds by explaining the situation, suggesting adjusting the price range, and mentions that they can swap BTC back to USDC. He also shares that the same thing happened to him, which might add a bit of camaraderie but still addresses a problem.

Other users like KaiArne90 and BasementNodes discuss finding old pools and transaction reports, mentioning that some tools are confusing or have edge cases. There's a mention of "Mars being the most confusing thing" and issues with credit accounts causing headaches. RoboMcGobo talks about difficulties with tax software and Mars credit accounts. 

Positive sentiments come from TisMeAgain wishing the team luck and praising their work, which is clearly positive. There's also a thank you from KaiArne90 and some appreciation for features. However, the majority of the messages are either neutral (providing information, links) or negative (expressing confusion, problems with features, edge cases, slippage issues). 

The support bot messages are neutral, just providing links. Mikebarb's responses are helpful but address problems, which might lean negative. The repeated mentions of confusion, problems, and edge cases suggest a negative sentiment overall. Even though there's one positive message, the rest are either neutral or dealing with issues, making the overall sentiment more negative.

The sentiment of the text is **negative**. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **User Concerns & Confusion**:  
   - Multiple users (e.g., CR202020, KaiArne90, BasementNodes) express confusion about technical aspects like pool ranges ("NEAR BOUNDS"), liquidity removal delays, tax reporting issues

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat. The user provided a bunch of messages with timestamps and usernames, and they want me to parse through them to find any tasks, decisions made, or next steps that need to be taken.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with the most recent ones. The latest message is from mikebarb at 18:58:37, saying "Sounds good. Let us know if you have any other questions üß™". That seems like a closing statement, maybe not an action item. Then CR202020 at 18:58:13 says "Thanks...I may do this later...am about to go out now". Not sure if there's an action here, maybe just acknowledging something.

Looking at the previous messages, osmosis_statbot at 18:47:57 links to the support site. That's a suggestion, but maybe not an action item. Then mikebarb suggests opening a support ticket for private chat. That could be a next step for the user to take if they need help. 

mikebarb also mentions that if the price is near bounds, it's almost outside the range. Then he refers to a video explaining it. The user CR202020 asks about "NEAR BOUNDS" and the ratio of BTC/USDC. mikebarb explains that when out of range, tokens are converted to a single asset and suggests swapping BTC back to USDC to create a new position or wait for the price to return. So here, possible action items could be adjusting the price range, swapping tokens, or creating a new position.

Another part is CR202020 asking if removing liquidity takes 7 days. mikebarb says you can remove and readjust without waiting if not using superfluid staking. So the next step here might be to remove liquidity and readjust positions immediately.

Then there's a discussion about Osmosis burning tokens. mikebarb mentions a proposal is needed for manual burn, and parameters aren't set for a burn split yet. So action items here could involve creating a proposal for the manual burn.

Later, there's a conversation about stake.tax and its maintenance. RoboMcGobo says they're working with Roger to add new features, but
