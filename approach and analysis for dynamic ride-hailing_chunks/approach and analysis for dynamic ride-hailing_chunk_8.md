a Maximum waiting time constraint in place. b Service rate maximization. c

Waiting time minimization. that in the classic dial-a-ride problem, there are usually time windows
associated with the dynamically arising customer requests, indicating
when the customers want to get picked up and/or dropped off.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of the text chunk is explaining the key components of a dynamic dispatch system for ride-hailing services.

**Technical Details:**

* The section describes various techniques used in dynamic dispatch systems, including:
	+ Scheduling algorithms (e.g., delay-free scheduling, earliest arrival first)
	+ Resource allocation strategies (e.g., capacity constraints, time windows)
	+ Vehicle assignment and routing models
* It also mentions the importance of waiting time minimization, which is a key objective in this context.

**Context:**

This section builds upon the surrounding context by providing an overview of dynamic dispatch systems for ride-hailing services. The text references various papers and methodologies mentioned earlier in the document, highlighting their relevance to the topic.

The section's focus on the waiting time constraint and its association with dynamically arising customer requests is crucial because it implies that the service provider needs to manage wait times efficiently to satisfy customers while also considering other factors like service rate maximization and capacity constraints.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

* The section requires a minimum of 6-8 hours of simulation time (implied by the "delayed" notation)
* It assumes access to a simulation platform (e.g., DIMACS Center for Discrete Mathematics) that can handle large-scale simulations
* The section also mentions the need for data on demand forecasting, which is another critical component of dynamic dispatch systems.
