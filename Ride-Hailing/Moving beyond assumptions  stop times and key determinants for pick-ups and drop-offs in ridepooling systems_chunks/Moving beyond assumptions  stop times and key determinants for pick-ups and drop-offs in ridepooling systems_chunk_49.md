**Original Text:**

For future research, it will be essential to validate our findings with empirical data from
other ridepooling services in order to substantiate the significant determinants influencing
stop times and to confirm the applicability of log-logistic CDFs. Additionally, comparing
stop times across different cities, regions, or countries could provide valuable insights into
whether stop times vary due to traffic behaviour, local conditions or cultural factors. The
influence of mobility-impaired passengers, such as those using wheelchairs or canes for
blind people, could not be observed in our empirical investigation. Exploring how these factors affect stop time would also be a valuable contribution. Looking ahead to future mobility
services, an important question is whether our data will accurately reflect stop times for AVs. Various projects and pilots are already testing or planning to operate DRT services with AVs
