## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the provided text and identify the key points and decisions. The user wants a concise summary focusing on those.

Looking at the timestamps, the most recent message is from rcjulin_ForkDAO wishing everyone a happy birthday with some emojis. Then there's calabiyau87 sharing project links related to various DAOs and protocols like WHALE Furnace, Eris Protocol, Backbone Labs, Ophir DAO, Ash DAO, and Guppy DAO. Each has specific URLs, so those are important to include as key resources.

The unknown user posts multiple birthday messages for #NFT #News #7 and #794, noting their 2-year and 1-year anniversaries. They list hashtags from two years ago and one year ago, which might indicate past projects or topics. But maybe the key point here is the celebration and the reference to Twitter posts.

Then there's faneatiku and Asa332 discussing Twitter posts and DApp updates. Faneatiku mentions adding an external link for "Read more" on a DApp, and they're coordinating sharing a link. The conversation includes a governance proposal from BeeZee blockchain, proposal #36, which is about limiting the max supply of BZE to 400M. They talk about minting halting until burning occurs, and governance adjustments. The user faneatiku also shares a link to the proposal on the explorer.

Other messages from unknown users mention redelegate foundation delegation from validators who didn't vote, implying some governance action related to validator participation. Faneatiku responds to that, indicating they're handling it.

So the main decisions here are the governance proposal #36 to cap BZE supply at 400M with burn and governance adjustments, and the coordination to share this via Twitter and DApp with an external link. Also, the project links shared by calabiyau87 are key resources. The birthday mentions are probably less critical unless they relate to the proposal, but the user wants key points and decisions, so maybe just note the project links and the governance proposal.

I should structure the summary to highlight the governance proposal details first, then the project links, and the coordination between faneatiku and others to announce it. Avoid redundant info like duplicate birthday messages. Also note the redelegate action as part of the governance steps.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand what the text contains.

Looking at the text, there are several messages from different users. The first one is from rcjulin_ForkDAO with a greeting and some emojis. Then calabiyau87 shares project links related to various protocols and DAOs like WHALE Furnace, Eris Protocol, Backbone Labs, Ophir DAO, Ash DAO, and Guppy DAO. Each of these has URLs. 

Next, there are multiple messages from unknown users celebrating the birthday of some news, mentioning hashtags like #NFT, #News, #7, and others. They reference Twitter posts and list various projects and hashtags from two years ago and one year ago. The hashtags include things like #CRE, #FLIX, #GNOLand, etc., and some projects like Agentverse, Asteroid, CoinGecko, Cosmos, etc. 

Then faneatiku and Asa332 discuss adding links to a DApp, retweeting, and governance proposals. The last part is about a governance proposal on the BeeZee blockchain regarding limiting the max supply of BZE coins.

So, the main topics here are the projects and protocols mentioned in the links: WHALE Furnace, Eris Protocol (LSD/DeFi), Backbone Labs (LSD/NFT-Fi), Ophir DAO (Bonds/Redeemable Treasury/DeFi), Ash DAO, and Guppy DAO. Additionally, the governance proposal related to BZE's max supply and the birthday celebrations of the news with associated hashtags and projects might be considered topics. However, the user might be more interested in the specific projects and protocols rather than the birthday mentions. 

Wait, the user says "main topics," so I need to determine which are the key points. The project links are definitely important. The birthday messages are recurring but they list various hashtags and past projects. The governance proposal is another key topic. The retweeting and social media interactions are part of the communication but maybe not the main topics. 

I should list the main projects and protocols mentioned in the links, as well as the governance proposal. The hashtags in the birthday messages might be topics too, but perhaps the user wants the names of the projects rather than the hashtags themselves. For example, #

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

First, there's a message from rcjulin_ForkDAO saying "Hi all the cosmos" with some emojis like ü´°üßâü´Çüí°. The emojis seem friendly and positive, maybe indicating camaraderie and ideas. That looks neutral or positive.

Then there's a bunch of project links from calabiyau87. It's just sharing URLs to various protocols and DAOs. No obvious positive or negative words, so probably neutral.

Next, there are multiple messages from "unknown" users celebrating birthdays for NFT News #7 and #794, mentioning they're 2 and 1 year old respectively. They include emojis like üéÇ and some hashtags. Birthday celebrations are usually positive, so those messages are positive.

Looking at faneatiku's messages: "haha, nice ! üí™" is clearly positive with laughter and an encouraging emoji. Then there's a message about adding something on the DApp and needing an external link, which seems neutral. Another message says "No worries, I'm on it" which is positive, showing willingness to help. Another one is a retweet link and a request to another bot to only speak when directed. The retweet itself is neutral, but the instruction might be a bit negative? Not sure, maybe just a correction, so neutral.

Asa332 shares a link, which is neutral. 

Then there's a message from an unknown user saying if validators don't vote, they don't care, so they shouldn't have delegation. That's a bit negative, criticizing non-voting validators. Another message says not to forget to redelegate foundation delegation from non-voters. That's more of a directive, maybe neutral but could be seen as negative towards those not participating.

Faneatiku shares a link and another unknown user says "Make a tweet, we will retweet" which is positive collaboration. 

The last message from faneatiku is about a governance proposal to limit BZE supply. The content explains the proposal and encourages voting. Phrases like "your vote matters" and the üí™ emoji indicate a positive sentiment towards community involvement. However, the proposal itself is a factual statement, so the sentiment here is positive because of the encouraging tone.

Now, putting it all together.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll need to read through the text carefully.

Looking at the messages, there's a lot of links and mentions of Twitter posts. The most recent message from rcjulin_ForkDAO is just a greeting, so probably no action there. Then there are several "Happy Birthday" messages from unknown users, which seem to be celebrating old news posts. Those might not have actionable items, but maybe they're prompting a response?

The user faneatiku has a few messages. One says, "I'll also add it on the DApp but I will need an external link where the user can 'Read more'". That sounds like an action item where faneatiku is planning to update the DApp with an external link. Then another message: "Let me know when we share it." So they might be waiting for confirmation before proceeding.

Another message from faneatiku is "No worries, I'm on it" responding to a point about redelegate foundation delegation from non-voting validators. That indicates they're taking responsibility for that task. Also, "Make a tweet, we will retweet" from an unknown user, and faneatiku responds by sharing a link to a Twitter post. So there's an action to create a tweet, which faneatiku has already done.

The main governance proposal from faneatiku is about voting on Proposal #36 to limit BZE supply. The message includes a link to the proposal and encourages participation. That's a key decision point for the community, so the next step is voting on that proposal.

I should list each action item, decision, or next step clearly. Make sure to attribute them correctly based on the user. Also, check if any deadlines or specific instructions are mentioned. In this case, the proposal link is provided, and faneatiku mentions adding to the DApp with a read more link. The redelegate task is another action item they've taken on. The tweets are being handled with retweets and a shared link.

I need to present these in a structured way, maybe bullet points under each category. Ensure that each extracted item is concise and directly taken from the text without adding interpretations. Also, note the governance proposal as a decision that needs community input.
