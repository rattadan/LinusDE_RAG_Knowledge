First, let me summarize each tweet:

   - This tweet suggests that market downturns or corrections are actually good times to focus on foundational technology development.

2. "Expanding payments globally isn’t plug-and-play. Each new market adds complexity because the technical architecture differs from country to country. When we first built international payment capabilities, I was surprised at how much had to change from our US stack."

3. "Big news for iOS developers…\n\nEpic vs. Apple’s external payments ruling just changed the game for app devs.\n\nApple can no longer stop apps from linking to external checkouts or charge a 30% cut on purchases made outside the app. This is massive for devs selling digital goods." (May 5, 2025)
   - This tweet announces a significant legal ruling against Apple regarding external payment systems in iOS apps, which Dan views as beneficial for app developers.

4. "In payments, trust drives referrals.\n\nAt Coinflow, we’re seeing banks, payment processors, and even crypto skeptics send merchants our way."
