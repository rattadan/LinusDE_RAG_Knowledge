If you have reason to believe that your information is no longer secure, please let us know bycontacting ususing the methods provided in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy below.

The California Shine the Light law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt-out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not currently share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

Under Nevada law, Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of covered personal information. Offchain Labs does not currently sell covered information of Nevada consumers as defined under applicable Nevada law.

You may submit an opt-out request by sending your request to the email address or mailing address specified in theContact UsSection below, along with your full name, complete mailing address (including street address, city, state, and zip code), email address (so that we can contact you, if needed, in connection with the request) and confirmation that you are a Nevada resident.

The personal information that we collect or receive may be transferred to and processed in countries located outside of your country of residence to the countries where we or our third-party service providers process it. The data protection laws of the countries where personal information is processed may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in your country of residence. Whenever we transfer personal information internationally, we take steps to protect it as required under applicable law.
