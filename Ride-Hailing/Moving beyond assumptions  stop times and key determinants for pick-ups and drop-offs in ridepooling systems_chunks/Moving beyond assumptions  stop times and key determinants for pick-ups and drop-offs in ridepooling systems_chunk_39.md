**Original Text:**

Considering a significance level of 0.05 for
the null hypothesis that the empirical data and the CDF are well-matched, the resulting
p-values of the analysed CDFs are presented in Table 5. Our analysis indicates that the loglogistic distribution provides the best fit for the empirical stop times for both boarding and
alighting. Regarding the cumulative probability, the log-logistic CDF is assumed in the following
form:

 x a − a1
f (x) = 1 − 1 +
, x ∈ R+
(2)
c
where x represents the stop time in seconds and the parameters a and c determine the
shape and scale of the fitted log-logistic distribution. Figure 5 presents the corresponding graph for pick-up stops, demonstrating that the fitted CDF can represent stop times
up to 45 s. Afterwards, the CDF overestimated the cumulative probability compared to
the empirical data.
