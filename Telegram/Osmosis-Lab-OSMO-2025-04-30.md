## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the key points and decisions. The user wants a concise summary focusing on those.

Looking at the messages, there's a discussion about Solana bridges not working. Sardon70 mentions they can't support SOL on Osmosis, and Mikebarb confirms he sees allsol on the bridge but not Solana as a destination. Then there's a suggestion to use skip.build, but Sardon70 hasn't tried it yet. 

Next, there's a conversation about Robo stepping down from the Osmosis Grants Program to avoid conflicts of interest. Davidjgoosey and Oldi6 discuss this, with Oldi6 saying he should have stepped down earlier and that it's best for Osmosis. Mikebarb mentions Robo is still involved but will make a public announcement later.

Then, some users talk about tokenomics. User_343756695 suggests Osmosis needs improvement to compete with Strd, which uses buybacks and burns. Jasbanza links OSMO's price increase to hiring more devs and better development. 

There's also a proposal to add Eureka as a canonical bridge provider by Osmogovbot, which would allow their assets to be listed without suffixes. 

Other points include Binance Earn's high APY for OSMO by Skaik007, and some general optimism from MLIzi. Yusungsang and Dhomart share links, and there's a mention of Polaris being a different network.

So the main topics are the Solana bridge issues, Robo stepping down, tokenomics concerns, the Eureka bridge proposal, and some OSMO price and APY mentions. I need to structure these into a clear summary without the extra details like links and reactions. Focus on the decisions and key issues raised.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Solana Bridge Issues**: Users report problems with Solana bridges (e.g., "allsol" visible but Solana not listed as a destination on Polaris). Alternative solutions like [skip.build](https://go.skip.build/) were suggested.  
2. **Robo‚Äôs Osmosis Grants Program Departure**: Davidjgoosey confirmed Robo is stepping down from the Osmosis Grants Program to avoid conflicts of interest, with mixed

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the given text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key subjects.

Starting with the latest messages from mikebarb and Sardon70. They mention issues with bridges to/from Solana not working, specifically on Osmosis. So "Solana bridge issues" and "Osmosis bridge support" seem relevant here.

Looking at davidjgoosey's messages, there's a link and a mention of Robo stepping down from the Osmosis Grants Program to avoid conflicts of interest. That points to topics like "Osmosis Grants Program" and "Robo stepping down". Also, other users comment on Robo's departure, so "Community reaction to Robo's departure" could be another topic.

Then there's skaik07 and oldi6 discussing Binance Earn and a 20.99% APY on OSMO. That's about "Binance flexible OSMO APY" and "Binance Earn promotions".

The conversation around tokenomics comes up with user_343756695 comparing Osmosis and Stride's tokenomics. So "Osmosis tokenomics improvements" and "Stride tokenomics comparison" are topics here.

jasbanza talks about OSMO price affecting developer hiring, so "OSMO price impact on development" is another point.

There's a governance proposal from osmogovbot about adding Eureka as a canonical bridge provider, which relates to "Eureka bridge service provider proposal".

Other mentions include Polaris app by dhomart and i_j_o_k_a_r_i, so "Polaris app functionality" and "Polaris network clarification". Also, some users express optimism about OSMO (MLIzi) and criticism about Osmosis's vision (user_6685499784), leading to "Osmosis price optimism" and "Osmosis vision criticism".

The user_6685499784 also mentions ATOM and OSMO together, so "ATOM and OSMO synergy potential".

I need to make sure all these topics are distinct and cover the main points without redundancy. Let me list them out and check if any can be merged or if I missed something. The final list should be concise and capture all

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

First, there's a conversation between mikebarb and Sardon70 about issues with Solana bridges on Osmosis. Sardon70 says they're not working, and mikebarb mentions seeing allsol on the bridge but not Solana as a destination. The use of "hmm" and "I do see" might indicate some confusion or problem-solving. The sentiment here seems a bit negative because they're discussing technical issues.

Then there's a message from davidjgoosey sharing a link and another saying Robo is stepping down from the Osmosis Grants Program to avoid conflict of interest. The response from WhoIsAbk is "Fk robo one of the good ones üòû" which is clearly negative, showing frustration or disappointment. Others like mikebarb and oldi6 discuss Robo's potential announcement and whether he's still in charge, with oldi6 saying "Will be the best for osmosis if he steps down" which is positive, but the previous message from oldi6 says "He should have stepped down long time ago" which is negative. So there's mixed sentiment around Robo stepping down.

Looking at skaik007's messages about Binance earn and APY 20.99% on OSMO. High APY usually is positive, but without context, it's neutral. 

User_6685499784 says "it lacks vision imo, osmosis and atom together is the boom everyone has been waiting for. It's a real disaster on this point." That's negative, criticizing the project's vision. 

Wcc8311 and jasbanza have more positive takes, talking about Osmo and Atom being good projects and Osmo's rise benefiting developers. 

User_343756695 compares Strd and Osmo, suggesting Osmosis needs better tokenomics, which is a negative critique. 

MLIzi says "Be optimistic about OSMO" which is positive. 

The osmogovbot message is about a proposal, which is neutral as it's informational. 

Other messages from dhomart and i_j_o_k_a_r_i seem to be discussing Polaris, possibly a

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I need to read through all the messages carefully. The user mentioned that the assistant should analyze the chat messages and identify any actions, decisions, or next steps. 

Looking at the messages, there's a conversation about Solana bridges not working, someone suggesting trying a different bridge service, and discussions about Robo stepping down from the Osmosis Grants Program. There's also a proposal to add Eureka as a canonical bridge provider. 

Starting with the earliest messages. The user oldi6 asks if Robo is still in charge of Osmosis grants. Mikebarb says he's still with grants. Then later, davidjgoosey mentions that Robo is stepping down to avoid conflict of interest, and others respond to that. So the decision here is Robo stepping down. That's a key point.

Then there's a message from Sardon70 saying bridges to and from Solana aren't working. Mikebarb checks and says he can use beta.polaris.app, and suggests trying go.skip.build. Sardon70 tried allsol on the bridge but doesn't see Solana as a destination. So the action items here might be Sardon70 trying the suggested bridge, and maybe the team looking into the bridge support issues.

The osmogovbot message mentions a proposal to add Eureka as a canonical bridge service provider. That's a formal proposal, so the next step would be reviewing and voting on that proposal.

Other messages talk about tokenomics, Binance earn, and some links, but those might not be action items unless there's a specific task mentioned. For example, user_343756695 suggests Osmosis needs improvement in tokenomics, but it's a comment rather than an assigned task. 

Also, Yusungsang and mikebarb share links to Twitter posts, but unless there's a direct action to "check this link" or "review the content," maybe those aren't action items. 

So compiling the main points: the proposal to add Eureka, Robo stepping down, and the troubleshooting of Solana bridges. The next steps would be related to those. 

I should list each action item with the responsible party if mentioned. For example, Osmosis team might need to address the bridge issues, the community needs
