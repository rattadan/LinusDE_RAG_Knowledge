## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. Let me start by going through each message and identifying the main topics.

First, there's a user asking about sending USDT from Binance to Osmosis. Mikebarb suggests using app.squidrouter.com. Then another user asks if swapping ETH to Osmosis on Keplr is possible, and mikebarb mentions depositing ETH to Osmosis and swapping. 

Then there's a discussion about an API for live prices on Osmosis. User_1893955336 tried a URL but got a 401 error. Mikebarb provided an alternative API link. War_7z says the app.osmosis.zone link works for them. So the key point here is the API recommendations.

Next, JohnnyWyles87 talks about Osmosis Protocol revenue and emissions. He mentions a proposal looking into community pool revenue vs emissions, aiming to stabilize staking emissions. Davidjgoosey and khuwarzmi are involved in discussing a podcast reference where someone claimed $111M annual cost vs $11M revenue. They check the community pool and a spreadsheet for details. 

Sandro20212 asks Martians if they want an upgrade on Osmosis, referencing a proposal (MRC-132) for version v2.1.0. 

Venki1112tvk asks about unstaking OSMO, but there's no direct answer in the text. 

Also, there's a mention of a support site and a unified pool JSON structure from BasementNodes. 

So the main topics are: bridging USDT from Binance to Osmosis via SquidRouter, API for Osmosis prices (with specific links), Osmosis financials (revenue vs emissions), and a proposal for upgrading the Mars outpost. 

I need to structure the summary around these key points, noting the decisions or recommendations made. Also, check if any other points are important. The user's question about unstaking time isn't addressed here, so maybe mention that it's asked but unanswered. 

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight the bridge solution, API options, financial discussions, and the proposal. Avoid minor details like the VPN issue unless it's a decision point. Focus on actionable info and decisions.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as comma-separated values. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring or significant themes.

Starting with the first message, mikebarb mentions app.squidrouter.com as a good option. That seems related to a tool or service for Osmosis. Then KRYPTO_NIGHT is asking about a bridge for USDT from Binance to Osmosis. So, cross-chain bridges and USDT transfers are a topic here. mikebarb later confirms that squidrouter can be used, so maybe that's part of the bridge topic.

Money_Printer888 asks if swapping ETH to Osmosis on Keplr is possible. That's about token swaps and wallet compatibility. bcosmos had an error on Levana Finance for perpetuals on Osmosis, and mikebarb asks about a VPN or blocker, so maybe issues with accessing certain platforms and troubleshooting.

This touches on financial metrics, community pool revenue, staking emissions, and governance proposals.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people discussing Osmosis, which seems to be a blockchain or DeFi platform. The task is to determine the overall sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I need to go through each message and see the tone. Starting with the latest message from mikebarb at 23:05:13, he says "app.squidrouter.com is a good option." The word "good" here is positive. Then KRYPTO_NIGHT wishes the community a happy new year, which is positive, and asks a question about bridging USDT. The question itself is neutral but the greeting is positive.

Looking at the previous messages, mikebarb again helps someone by suggesting using app.squidrouter.com, which is positive. Money_Printer888 asks if a swap is possible, which is neutral. bcosmos thanks mikebarb for helping with a connection issue, using "Oh nice good catch" and "Thank you!" which are positive.

There's a mention of an API that works from war_7z, positive. User_1893955336 has a 401 error, which is negative, but mikebarb offers an alternative API link, positive. JohnnyWyles87 talks about Osmosis's financials, mentions "laughable overestimate" which is negative, but also points out improvements, which is positive. 

Khuwarzmi shares revenue data, which is neutral but factual. Davidjgoosey reacts with excitement to JohnnyWyles87's comment, using emojis and "awesome," so positive. There's a discussion about expenses and a podcast mention, with some skepticism about numbers, which might be neutral or slightly negative. However, the overall tone in those parts is more about seeking information rather than expressing strong sentiment.

Other messages include BasementNodes sharing a GitHub link and basedstaker introducing a new API, which are neutral or positive as they're providing resources. Vraneshi asks about expenses, which is neutral, and there's some back-and-forth about data sources. 

The majority of the messages are either neutral (questions, sharing links) or positive (thanks, suggestions, sharing resources). There are a few negative points like the 401 error and the skepticism about financial estimates, but those are

JohnnyWyles87 mentions a proposal in the works about community pool revenue vs emissions, so next steps might involve following that proposal. Davidjgoosey and khuwarzmi discuss a podcast link and checking the community pool spend proposals on mintscan. Vraneshi talks about a podcast where someone claimed $111M annual cost vs $11M revenue, leading to Khuwarzmi asking for the link.

So action items here are to test the API, provide feedback, and possibly support financially. Venki1112tvk asks about unstaking OSMO days, which is a question needing
