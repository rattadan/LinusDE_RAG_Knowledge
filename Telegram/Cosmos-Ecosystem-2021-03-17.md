## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on the key points and decisions. Let me start by looking through the tweets.

First, there's a THORChain Weekly Dev Update #85. Not sure what that includes, but maybe just mention it as a development update. Then Cosmos Proposal #41 is in the voting period, which is about enabling IBC transfers on Cosmos Hub. That's important because it's a governance decision.

Another tweet asks about testing critical systems like Tendermint Core and their resilience. So that's a question about system testing and improvements. $KEX is live on BSC, which is a launch announcement. The Interchain Foundation has their 12th update and an upcoming event. 

Cyb Master is looking for a magician to lead a browser project. That's a job posting or call for a leader. DailyFinance lists e-Money as a top fintech in Denmark. THORChain Gitlab contributors' evolution and Tendermint's GitHub story are mentioned. 

Cosmos's GitHub story is also highlighted. OmniFlixTV deployed successfully on Akash Network. Mainnet 2 Recap Livestream scheduled for March 19th. Adriana's summary and long-tweet threads. OmniFlix Network's personal message. Ki Foundation and Titans Ventures partnership. 

Another Cosmos Hub proposal submitted. CosmWasm community call recap. New tooling for IBC modules. Secret Network's Secret Swap tutorial. Anchor Protocol live in web app. CertiK analyzing True Seigniorage Dollar attack. CosmJS TypeScript library. Sifchain's biweekly update. 

HARD Money Market V2 launch date set. Kava Labs collaborating with Crank Studio and others. Terra governance proposal. Persistence supporting HackAtom RU. Keplr's birthday event winners. CosmWasm and IBC event on March 18th. Secret Network update. Agoric's DeFi tutorial. Cosmos biweekly infographics. Juno and Keplr partnership. KAVA 5 testnet success. Cosmos Network weekly update. Peng Zhong's note on Cosmos SDK's adoption. Uptick's NFT dApp. News from Starname and Sputnik.

So key points are proposals in voting, launches (like $KEX on BSC, Anchor Protocol, HARD V2), partnerships (Ki Foundation, Kava Labs), deployments (OmniFlixTV on Akash), updates

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. The text consists of multiple tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. 

First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the key topics. The main topics are usually mentioned in the body of the tweet, sometimes with hashtags. For example, the first tweet mentions "THORChain: Weekly Dev Update #85" so the topic here is THORChain. Then there's a proposal about enabling IBC transfers on Cosmos Hub, so IBC transfers would be another topic.

Looking at the third tweet, it's about testing critical distributed systems like Tendermint Core, so Tendermint Core testing and engineering resilience/stability are topics. The fourth tweet mentions $KEX on BSC, so that's BSC integration. 

The Interchain Foundation updates and events are separate topics. Then there's a job posting from Cyb Master for a browser project, which could be categorized under job opportunities or project announcements. 

Other tweets include CosmWasm community calls, IBC modules development, Secret Network tutorials, Anchor Protocol launch, CertiK analysis of an attack, Cosmos biweekly infographics, partnerships like Juno & Keplr, Kava Labs updates, HARD Money Market launch, Terra governance proposals, Persistence supporting HackAtom RU, Keplr's birthday event, CosmWasm & IBC event, Peng Zhong's statement on Cosmos-SDK blockchains, Uptick as an NFT dApp, and news from Starname & Sputnik.

I should make sure to capture each unique topic without repetition. Also, check if some topics are part of the same category but mentioned differently. For instance, IBC is mentioned in multiple contexts, but each instance might be a separate topic. However, since the user wants main topics, grouping related ones might be better, but since each tweet is a separate announcement, they might need individual mention. 

Wait, the user says "main topics" so maybe I should list each project or key term once. But looking at the examples, some projects are mentioned multiple times. For example, THORChain appears in two different tweets. But each tweet is a separate update, so maybe each should be considered a separate topic. However, the main topics would be the projects themselves, not each mention. Hmm, the instruction isn't entirely clear. But since the

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a bunch of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral.

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. Let me start by reading them all to get a sense. The tweets mention things like weekly updates, proposals entering voting periods, successful testnet launches, new events, partnerships, and technical developments. There's also some excitement in one with "It's really AMAZING!!!" in all caps and exclamation points. That seems clearly positive.

Most of the tweets are informational. They're announcing events, updates, launches, or partnerships. For example, "Cosmos Proposal #41 'Enable #IBC transfers on Cosmos Hub' is now in VOTING PERIOD" is neutral because it's just stating a fact. Similarly, "Anchor Protocol is now live in the web app" is a positive development, but the way it's phrased is more neutral as it's just announcing the launch.

Some tweets have words like "success" which are positive. "KAVA 5 Incentivized Testnet Launch: Success!" definitely has a positive spin. Others mention being "live" or "exclusive tutorial," which could be seen as positive because they indicate progress or new opportunities.

I should check for any negative terms. The only one that might be a bit negative is "The CertiK team digs into the True Seigniorage Dollar attack!" The word "attack" could be negative, but in the context of a blockchain project, it's more about addressing an issue, which might be neutral or even positive because they're taking action. But "attack" itself is a negative term, so maybe that one is slightly negative. However, the tweet is about analyzing the attack, which is a proactive step, so maybe neutral or even positive. Hmm, tricky. I might lean towards neutral here unless there's clear negative language, which there isn't.

The tweet with "AMAZING!!!" in caps is a strong positive. Others like "Top Fintech Companies" or "successful deployment" are positive. Then there's "doubling down on its overall resilience and stability" which is positive because they're improving the system.

Now, counting the sentiments. Let's see:

- Positive: The ones with "AMAZING", "Success", "Top Fintech", "successful

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. Action items are usually things that need to be done, like tasks or assignments. Decisions would be something that has been decided, and next steps are upcoming actions or steps following previous discussions.

Looking at the first few tweets:

- THORChain Weekly Dev Update #85: Not an action item, just an update.
- Cosmos Proposal #41 in voting period: This indicates a decision point where people need to vote. So "Vote on Cosmos Proposal #41 to enable IBC transfers on Cosmos Hub" is a decision.
- The question about testing Tendermint Core: This might be prompting a discussion or a task for the team to address, but it's phrased as a question. Maybe not an action item unless there's a follow-up.
- $KEX live on BSC: This is an announcement, not an action item.
- ICF Update, job posting for Cyb Master, event announcements: The job posting could be an action item if someone needs to apply, but since it's a tweet, it's more informational. Events like the livestream on March 19th are next steps for the community to attend.
- HARD Money Market Version 2 Launch on March 24th: That's a specific date, so the next step is preparing for that launch.
- Governance proposals from Terra and others: These would require community action, like voting.
- CertiK team analyzing an attack: Not an action item unless they're planning to release a report or fix.
- Keplr 1st Birthday Event Winners: Announcement, not an action.
- Upcoming CosmWasm and IBC event on March 18th: Next step is attending that event.

I need to make sure I don't miss any deadlines or required actions. Also, check for any proposals that need voting, launches that need preparation, or events that require participation. The user probably wants a concise list of these points. Let me compile them all.

Here are the extracted **action items, decisions, or next steps** from the text:

1. **Vote on Cosmos Proposal #41**  
   - Decision: The community must vote on enabling IBC
