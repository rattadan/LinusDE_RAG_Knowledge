This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

To accept a proposal, the passenger must first initialize an escrow account using the proposer’s NRIDE address. This involves sending a deposit into the escrow account, which can be automated for convenience. With the escrow account initialized, the passenger can then broadcast an "Acceptance" message to nearby
drivers, informing all proposers that a proposal has been accepted. The selected proposer can then continue with the ride request, while the other drivers return to listening for
requests. The escrow account ensures that the driver is paid for their services, while also providing a layer
of security and protection for both the passenger and the driver. Acceptance {
String id;
String source;
String proposalID;
String escrowID;
}

2.2.6. Confirmation
After a passenger broadcasts an "Acceptance" message to nearby drivers, the driver whose proposal was selected will receive the message and use the provided escrow ID to check the passenger’s deposit in the escrow account.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

1. **Escrow Mechanism:** The escrow mechanism is implemented using smart contracts deployed on JUNO (CosmWasm), specifically on DAO DAO. It ensures accountability and provides compensation using NRIDE tokens.
2. **NRIDE Token:** The platform uses a custom cryptocurrency called NRIDE, which has the following features:
	* **Minting and Management:** DAO infrastructure controls NRIDE token minting and management.
3. **Smart Contracts:**
	* **Deployment:** JUNO (CosmWasm) deployed smart contracts for mission implementation.
4. **Open-source Software:** The platform's open-source codebase is built on top of the JUNO blockchain framework.
