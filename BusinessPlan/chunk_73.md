Description

Mitigation

Blockchain service outage: The nRide smart-contracts are
initially deployed on the Juno blockchain. If Juno were to halt
or slow down dramatically, users would not be able to use the
application. Blockchains can halt for various reasons, but
mainly during manual intervention when a critical
bug/vulnerability is found. Restarting a chain can take a
number of days because the community needs to review,
agree and vote on a new release candidate, and coordinate a
software upgrade.

Mitigation

To mitigate this risk, Juno blockchain can implement additional measures such as:

- Providing transparent communication with users about the status of the system and any potential disruptions

It's worth noting that the document does not provide additional risk mitigation strategies for other technical risks, such as security vulnerabilities or software compatibility issues.
