## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 19

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

When delayed responses are
allowed, often variants of matching problems are solved to assign
the gathered open requests to the available vehicles. The objective
functions used in the matching can include, e.g., the service rate, the
waiting time, or driving costs (Hyland and Mahmassani, 2018; Maciejewski et al., 2016; Lyu et al., 2019). In Miao et al. (2016), fairness
regarding similar service rates in different parts of the service area is
also incorporated in the matching. Gao et al. (2016) consider additional
assignment constraints due to heterogeneous vehicles and customer
preferences. Qin et al. (2021) use a common matching approach as
well, but learn a dynamic time interval between the matchings with
reinforcement learning. Shi et al. (2021) and Xu et al. (2018) learn
the cost matrix of the matching problem. By that, it can be taken into
account that vehicles are differently profitable in different parts of the
service area. Alonso-Mora et al. (2017) and Wallar et al.
