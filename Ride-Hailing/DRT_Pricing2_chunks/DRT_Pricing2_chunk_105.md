## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 105

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

10 depicts an example of the noise
factor for one specific point in time for the whole service area. B.1. Euclidean distances
Fig. 7 shows the overlap of two zones for Euclidean distances. The
overlapping area consists of two equally sized circular segments. Let 𝑑
be the distance between the center of both zones and ℎ = 𝑇𝑊 − 𝑑2 be
the segment’s height. Based on the general formula for the area of a
circular segment (Weisstein, 2002), the area of each of the segments
can be calculated as follows:
)
(
√
ℎ
− (𝑇𝑊 − ℎ) 2 𝑇𝑊 ℎ − ℎ2
(8)
𝐴segment = 𝑇𝑊 2 cos−1 1 −
𝑇𝑊
By doubling this value to get the full overlap area and putting this into
relation to the total area of the zone, we get the overlap proportion by
the following formula:
overlap =

2 𝐴segment
𝜋 𝑇𝑊 2

B.2. Manhattan distances
Fig. 8 shows the overlap of two zones for Manhattan distances. Here,
the overlap always forms a rectangle.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The specific technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk are:

1. The general formula to calculate the area of a circular segment (overlapping zone) as per Weisstein (2002):
   - \(A_{segment} = \frac{\pi}{4}(T - 2\sqrt{T})^2\)

This formula allows for the calculation of the overlapping area between two zones.

2. The method to calculate the overlap proportion by doubling the segment's area and relating it to the total zone area:
   - \(overlap = 2A_{segment} / \pi T W^2\)
3. The relationship between Manhattan distances and their effect on the overlap of two zones, where:
   - For a rectangle (manhattan distance), \(T = 2\sqrt{T}\)

This allows for the calculation of the segment area based on Manhattan distances.

The chunk is connecting to the surrounding context by providing technical details and formulas used in ride-hailing systems to model and analyze the operations involved. The specific focus is on:

- Calculating overlap areas between zones
- Determining the proportion of the zone that overlaps
- Using these calculations to optimize route planning, fleet management, and demand forecasting

The connection builds upon the surrounding context by providing a technical foundation for analyzing and optimizing ride-hailing systems, addressing key aspects such as demand forecasting, vehicle repositioning, and empty-car routing.
