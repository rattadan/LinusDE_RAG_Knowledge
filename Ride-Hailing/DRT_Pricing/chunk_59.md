It seems like you're referring to a research paper by Ihab Kaddoura and colleagues on the impact of tolling on Demand Response Time (DRT) trips.

The paper you mentioned is likely titled something like "The impact of pricing on demand response time: A study on DRT trips" or "Pricing strategies for smart grids: Evaluating their effect on DRT trips".

In this study, the authors explore how different pricing schemes can affect the number of Demand Response Time (DRT) trips. They found that when the minimum fee is increased to 3 EUR, expanding the service area has a significant impact on both the number of residents and DRT trips.

According to the paper, for every additional EUR per resident in the service area, there's an approximate increase of 4 times in the number of residents, but only a factor of 10 increase in DRT trips. This suggests that increasing the minimum fee can lead to significant changes in both the number of people being served and the frequency of their responses.

It's worth noting that this study was conducted on a specific dataset or scenario, and the results may not generalize to all situations. However, it provides an interesting insight into how pricing strategies can impact DRT trips and suggests potential implications for smart grid management and demand response systems.
