## Chunk 74

**Original Text:**

Future studies will address service concepts which aim at a desired mode shift effect. The simulation setup will
also be extended to account for intermodal trips, in particular the combination of PT and DRT which is expected to
have a positive effect on the modal shift from car to PT and/or DRT. Furthermore the base case will be extended by
other modes of transportation, such as car sharing and conventional taxis, which are also highly relevant for the modal
shift towards DRT. Acknowledgements

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you've provided a passage from an article or proposal for a future study. Here's a reformatted version with added context:

Future studies will focus on service concepts aimed at inducing a desired mode shift effect. To achieve this, the simulation setup will be expanded to account for intermodal trips, specifically the combination of public transportation (PT) and dedicated rapid transit (DRT). The positive impact of such combinations is anticipated on the modal shift from cars to PT and/or DRT.

In addition to these modal shifts, the base case will be extended by including other modes of transportation that are highly relevant for the overall journey experience. These may include car sharing services and conventional taxis, which will also play a significant role in shaping the mode of travel towards DRT.
