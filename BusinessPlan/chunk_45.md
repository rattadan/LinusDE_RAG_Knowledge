**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing an event or initiative that aims to promote and support developers who create applications using the nRide protocol. Here's a rewritten version with minor adjustments for clarity and grammar:

"We plan to host virtual summits focused on informing drivers about the benefits of our nRide driver registry and application. These virtual summits will provide valuable insights on how our platform can help drivers earn more money, reduce their costs, and streamline their work processes. By educating drivers on how nRide can benefit them, we hope to accelerate the adoption of our protocol and drive sustained growth in usage and adoption."
