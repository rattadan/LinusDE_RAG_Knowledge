Introduction
Mobility on-demand (MoD) systems have started to change mobility systems worldwide, thanks to the ability of massive coordi­
nation between vehicles and users. Although these systems (such as Uber, Cabify, Didi or Lyft) can coordinate efficiently by reducing
the idle time in comparison with traditional taxis (Cramer and Krueger, 2016), research has shown that they are most likely increasing
congestion as some trips that could be done in public transport are now carried in these smaller and non-shared vehicles (Tirachini and
Gomez-Lobo, 2020; Henao and Marshall, 2019; Agarwal et al., 2019). In order to take advantage of the new technologies and reduce congestion, Shared1 Mobility on-Demand (SMoD, also known as
“ridesharing”) systems have been proposed, in which different passengers whose routes are somewhat similar share a vehicle (Santi
et al., 2014).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk describes the technical details and parameters of ridesharing systems, specifically focusing on how they manage vehicles and optimize their usage.

The exact technical details and processes described include:

1. **Vehicle coordination**: The system coordinates multiple vehicles to reduce idle time and increase efficiency.
2. **Meeting points**: The use of meeting points allows passengers to share a vehicle with other passengers who have similar routes, reducing congestion.
3. **Optimization heuristics**: Researchers propose various optimization strategies, such as heuristic approaches, mathematical modeling, and reinforcement learning, to improve the efficiency and user satisfaction of ridesharing systems.

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. **Building upon existing research**: The text references previous studies on mobility-on-demand systems, congestion reduction, and shared vehicle systems.
2. **Introducing new concepts**: It introduces the concept of Shared Mobility on-Demand (SMoD) and ride-sharing systems with meeting points.
3. **Providing a roadmap for future analysis or application development**: By discussing the current state of research in this area, it provides guidance for further analysis or application development.

Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned include:

1. **Research limitations**: The text highlights that previous studies have shown increasing congestion in MOd systems, but more research is needed to optimize their usage.
2. **Challenges and opportunities**: Researchers emphasize the challenges of coordinating multiple vehicles and meeting points, while also highlighting the opportunities for improving efficiency and user satisfaction.

The chunk does not provide any technical details or parameters related to specific ride-sharing system design or implementation. It focuses on the theoretical aspects and research trends in ridesharing systems.
