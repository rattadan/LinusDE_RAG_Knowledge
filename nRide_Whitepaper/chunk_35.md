## Chunk 35

**Original Text:**

sending tokens to the contract). -7T2

T2 is a longer timeout that triggers a default action in case either of the parties fails to submit a
message to the smart contract after both deposits have been paid. T2 is intended to cover the
time it would take to complete the pickup and is left to the discretion of the first party that creates the escrow. 3.2. Possible Outcomes
The following table contains the 16 possible end states of an escrow:

Approve(A,s_b)
Cancel(A)
T1(A)
T2(A)

Approve(B,s_a)
(1, 1)
(0.7, 1.3)
x
(0.5, 1.5)

Cancel(B)
(1.3, 0.7)
(0.5, 0.5)
(0, 1)
(0, 0.5)

T1(B)

(1, 0)

(1, 0)

T2(B)
(1.5, 0.5)
(0.5, 0)
(0, 1)
(0, 0)

In this table, the columns represent the four possible actions that can be taken by party B, while the rows
represent the four possible actions that can be taken by party A.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing a multi-party escrow system with two parties (A and B) where each party has different options for handling their contributions to the escrow account.

The table provided lists all possible outcomes of the escrow process, which are:

1. Approve(A,s_b)
2. Cancel(A)
3. T1(A)
4. T2(A)

And then it breaks down further into specific scenarios for each party's actions:

- For Party A:
  - Approve(s_b): 
    + (1, 1) - Accept both deposits
    + (0.7, 1.3) - Accept 70% and accept the remaining amount after deducting fees
    + x - Refuse to accept either deposit
  - T1(s_b)
    + x - Refuse to accept either deposit
  - T2(s_b)
    + (1, 0) - Accept both deposits and wait for the other party to follow through with their actions
    + x - Refuse to accept either deposit

- For Party B:
  - Approve(s_a):
    + (1, 1) - Accept both deposits
    + (0.7, 1.3) - Accept 70% and accept the remaining amount after deducting fees
    + x - Refuse to accept either deposit
  - Cancel():
    - (1.3, 0.7) - Accept only 30% of the deposit
    - (0.5, 0.5)
    - (0, 1)
    - (0, 0.5)
  - T1(s_a):
    + x - Refuse to accept either deposit
  - T2(s_a):
    + (1, 0) - Accept both deposits and wait for the other party to follow through with their actions
    + x - Refuse to accept either deposit

- For Party A:
  - Approve(s_b):
    + Approve(A,s_b)
    + Cancel(A)
    + T1(A)
    + T2(A)

- For Party B:
  - Approve(s_a):
    + Approve(B,s_a)
    + (1.3, 0.7) - Accept only 30% of the deposit
    + (0.5, 0.5)
    + (0, 1)
    + (0, 0.5)
  - Cancel():
    - (1.3, 0.7) - Accept only 30% of the deposit
    - (0.5, 0.5)
    - (0, 1)
    - (0, 0.5)

- For Party A:
  - Approve(s_b):
    + T1(A)
  - T2(A):
    + (1.5, 0.5) - Accept both deposits and wait for the other party to follow through with their actions
    + (0.5, 0)
    + (0, 1)
    + (0, 0)

- For Party B:
  - Approve(s_a):
    + T2(B)
    - (1.5, 0.5) - Accept both deposits and wait for the other party to follow through with their actions
    - (0.5, 0)
    - (0, 1)
    - (0, 0)

It seems like Party A has more flexibility in choosing what happens next, especially after they accept either deposit or T1(T2(A)).

Lastly, I noticed that the table is using different variables for actions taken by each party. It would be helpful to have consistent variable names throughout the table, as it can make it easier to understand and compare the different scenarios.
