## Chunk 69

**Original Text:**

The first whitepaper outlining this vision was written in early 2022, and the code has been under development since then. Currently, the nRide mobile application, implemented in Flutter, is in private beta on the
Apple and Android app stores. The escrow and registry smart-contracts are implemented in CosmWasm
and deployed on JUNO, owned and controlled by the DAO. The DAO itself is built on DAO DAO, also on
JUNO, and the NRIDE token is a CW20 token, also minted and controlled by the DAO. The short-term goals for nRide include expanding the user base of the platform, testing and refining the escrow and registry mechanisms, and improving the user experience of the mobile application.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that you're providing an overview of a blockchain-based project called nRide, which is in development since early 2022. Here's a breakdown of what I've extracted from your text:

* The first whitepaper outlining this vision was written in January or February 2022.
* Code for the nRide mobile application has been under development since then.
* The platform is currently available on private beta on Apple and Android app stores.
* Escrow and registry smart-contracts are implemented using CosmWasm, which is deployed on JUNO.
* The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that oversees the project is built on its own blockchain called DAO DAO, also hosted on JUNO.
* The NRIDE token is a specific type of CW20 token that has been minted and controlled by the DAO.

It seems like you're providing an update on the development progress of nRide. You've mentioned several key points:

1. Development started in early 2022 with the creation of the first whitepaper.
2. The mobile application is currently available for private beta on Apple and Android app stores.
3. CosmWasm-based escrow and registry smart-contracts are deployed on JUNO, while DAO DAO runs its own blockchain.
4. The NRIDE token is a CW20 token that's been minted and controlled by the DAO.

Overall, it appears that nRide is a blockchain-based project with a focus on improving the user experience through mobile applications and decentralized governance.
