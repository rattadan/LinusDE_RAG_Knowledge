**Putting It All in Context:**
Billyjitsu seems to be actively shaping a personal brand around practical DeFi education and execution. His critique of existing educational formats and emphasis on code repositories ("the repo") implies a mission to close the gap between theory and implementation in blockchain learning. His engagement with Api3DAO, including retweeting and interacting with their team, suggests he either collaborates with them or strongly supports their technical vision. The tweet about executing a liquidation indicates real-world experience in DeFi, possibly using it as a case study to reinforce his teaching philosophy.
