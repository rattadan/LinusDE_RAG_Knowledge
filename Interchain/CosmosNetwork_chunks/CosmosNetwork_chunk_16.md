## CosmosNetwork - Chunk 16

**Document Summary:**

This overview provides an excellent foundation for understanding Tendermint Core's architecture and its Application Binary Interface (ABCI). Let's break down the key components and their functionalities:

### 1. **Tendermint Core**
   - **Role**: Responsible for consensus, validation, and block propagation.
   - **Components**:
     - **Block Proposal**: Proposes new blocks based on transaction data.
     - **Commit Vote**: Collects votes from validators to finalize a block.
     - **Consensus Logic**: Implements BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) logic.

### 2. **ABCI Interface**
   - **Purpose**: Allows the application logic to interact with Tendermint Core.
   - **Primary Messages**:
     - **AppendTx**: Delivers transactions for validation and inclusion in blocks.
     - **CheckTx**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block (optional).
     - **Commit**: Computes cryptographic commitments of the current state.

### 3. **Application Logic**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Validate and process transactions.
     - Update application state based on transaction outcomes.
     - Respond to ABCI messages with appropriate responses.
     - Handle consensus-related tasks like reorg-proposals (if necessary).

### Detailed Breakdown

#### **AppendTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Delivers a transaction for validation and inclusion in the blockchain.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core receives a new transaction via the network.
  2. The transaction is passed to the application via `AppendTx`.
  3. Application validates the transaction against its state, protocol rules, and credentials.
  4. If valid, the application updates its internal state (e.g., UTXO database).
  5. Tendermint Core schedules the transaction for inclusion in a block.

#### **CheckTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core's mempool first checks each transaction with `CheckTx`.
  2. If the transaction passes, it is relayed to other peers for further validation.
  3. Validated transactions are then passed to application via `AppendTx` for state updates.

#### **Commit Message**
- **Purpose**: Computes a cryptographic commitment of the current application state.
- **Flow**:
  1. After processing all transactions in a block, Tendermint Core computes the commit state.
  2. This commit is signed by validators based on their voting power.
  3. The commit is then included in the next block header.

### Additional Features

#### **Validator Set Management**
- **Messages**: `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock`.
- **Purpose**:
  - `BeginBlock`: Passed to application at the start of each block, allowing it to update its state.
  - `EndBlock`: Passed after transactions have been processed, enabling finalization actions like reorg-proposal signing.

#### **Lightweight Client Support**
- **Commit Hashes**: Signed by validators, providing cryptographic proof of committed states.
- **Merkle Proofs**: Simplify verification for lightweight clients using block hashes and signed commit votes.

### Handling Byzantine Faults

1. **Forks**:
   - ≥ ⅓ Byzantine voting power can cause forks.
   - Detectable through inconsistencies in the state root, triggering social consensus mechanisms to heal the network.

2. **Censorship Attacks**:
   - > ⅔ Byzantine voting power can commit arbitrary invalid states.
   - Social consensus and legal measures are necessary for handling such failures.

3. **Reorg-Proposal Coordination**:
   - Signed by +½ of original validators, ensuring that external coordination is robust to network partitions.

### Conclusion
ABCI provides a flexible interface for integrating application logic with Tendermint Core’s consensus mechanism. By carefully validating transactions and updating state, applications can ensure consistency and reliability in blockchain operations. The ability to handle Byzantine faults through social consensus mechanisms further strengthens the overall system's resilience.

Introduction
The combined success of the open-source ecosystem, decentralized file-sharing, and public cryptocurrencies has inspired an understanding that decentralized internet protocols can be used to radically improve socio-economic infrastructure. We have seen specialized blockchain applications like Bitcoin [1] (a cryptocurrency), Zerocash [2] (a cryptocurrency for privacy), and generalized smart contract platforms such as Ethereum [3], with countless distributed applications for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) such as Augur (a prediction market) and TheDAO [4] (an investment club).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining Tendermint Core's Architecture, specifically its role in consensus, validation, block propagation, and application logic. Here's a focused analysis of what this section is explaining:

**Technical Details:**

* Tendermint Core implements Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) logic using the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.
* The core components include:
	+ Block Proposal: proposes new blocks based on transaction data.
	+ Commit Vote: collects votes from validators to finalize a block.
	+ Consensus Logic: implements BFT logic to ensure the integrity and order of the blockchain.

**Context Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

This chunk is connecting to and building upon the surrounding context by providing an overview of Tendermint Core's architecture, its role in consensus and validation, and the application logic. It also establishes a connection to the broader topic of decentralized internet protocols and their applications.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk that would impact its accuracy or relevance.

In terms of technical details, there is one notable point:

* The BFT logic implemented by Tendermint Core uses Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which has a different underlying mechanism compared to traditional proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms. This may affect the specific processes and parameters involved in BFT.

Overall, this chunk is providing an explanation of Tendermint Core's architecture and its role in decentralized systems, establishing connections to broader topics, and outlining key technical details relevant to understanding its functionality.
