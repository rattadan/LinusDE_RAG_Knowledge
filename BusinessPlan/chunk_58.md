**Proposal Submission and Review Process**

After drafting your proposal, please submit it to the nRide DAO page for review by the community.

Once submitted, your proposal will be posted on the platform, allowing other stakeholders to read and comment on it. This will enable a wider discussion around your proposal, ensuring that all relevant perspectives are considered before any decisions are made.

After the proposal has been submitted, the nRide community will have an opportunity to vote on its merits. This step allows for a more thorough evaluation of your proposal by the community at large.
