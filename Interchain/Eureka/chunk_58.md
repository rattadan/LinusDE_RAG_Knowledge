## Chunk 58

**Original Text:**

Otherwise, it will fail to execute with a permission error. Skip’s ERC20Approval object has 3 fields that define approval: _ token_contract: The address of the ERC-20 token on which the approval is granted _ spender: The address of the contract to which the approval will grant spend authority * amount: The amount of token_contract tokens the approval will grant the spender to spend
Check out EIP-2612 for more information on ERC-20 approvals. chain_id: This is the same as in the Cosmos context (simply an identifier for the chain), but it’s an int instead of a string
For more information on transactions, check out the Ethereum foundation’s docs

​
Example constructing & signing an EVM Transaction
​
1. Install Signing Library and Skip Library
To enable EVM transactions in your application, first install an EVM developer library. The most popular options are:

viem
ethers.js
web3.js
The code snippets below use viem.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're trying to construct a transaction for the ERC20Approval function on Cosmos with specific parameters. 

To construct and sign an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) transaction, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Get the signer**: The person or machine executing the transaction.
2. **Create a new transaction object**: Using the `web3` library, create a new transaction object with your chosen method (`ethers.js`, for example).

Here's an example to get you started:

```javascript
const { Web3 } = require('web3');
const signer = new Web3().ethers.getSigner();

// Get the signer's private key (or use their account address if you have it)
let account;
if (signer) {
  account = signer.address;
} else {
  console.error("No signer found.");
}

// Define the transaction
async function approve(tokenContractAddress, spenderAddress, amount) {
  // Set the transaction parameters
  const txParams = {
    from: account,
    to: tokenContractAddress,
    value: amount,
    gas: 20000,
    gasPrice: 20,
    data: ethers.utils.formatBytes16Array(['0x'], ['approve', 'string', 'address', 'uint256']),
  };

  // Create the transaction
  const tx = await new Web3()..ethers.sendSignedTransaction(txParams);

  // Wait for the transaction to be mined and confirm it
  console.log('Waiting for the transaction to be mined...');

  // Get the transaction receipt
  const receipt = await tx.wait(2);
  console.log(`Transaction receipt: ${receipt.hash}`);
}

approve('0xSomeTokenAddress', '0xBroadwayContractAddress', '1 ether');
```

In this example, we're assuming that `tokenContractAddress` and `spenderAddress` are the addresses of the token contract and the spender respectively. The transaction is signed with the current signer's private key.

Make sure to replace `'0xSomeTokenAddress'`, `'0xBroadwayContractAddress'`, and `'1 ether'` with the actual addresses you want to use. Also, ensure that your account has sufficient balance on the token contract to approve.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and you might need to add additional error handling or validation depending on your specific requirements.

As for the `EIP-2612` documentation mention, it seems like a topic specific to Ethereum contracts rather than Cosmos transactions. However, I've included a brief overview of how EIP-2612 works in Etherium below:

*   **ERC-20 approvals**: A contract's ability to spend its own token is determined by the `approved` property, which can be set when the contract receives approval from a user.
*   **EIP-2612**: This EIP was designed for use with Ethereum smart contracts. It allows for more control over approvals and spending on tokens.

You may want to refer to the official documentation of the Cosmos SDK (Cosmos.js) or other libraries you're using for more information on building transactions that work with your specific ecosystem.
