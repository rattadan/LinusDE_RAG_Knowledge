## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages, so I need to parse through them and identify the main issues and responses.

Starting from the top, Yusungsang shares a link from March 16, 2025. Then user_6678322360 mentions community members having issues creating positions in supercharged pools via mobile. Kychuli responds that mobile support for creating positions isn't available and the team isn't prioritizing it. They also mention that you can view positions on mobile but can't create them, so desktop is required. Arcmosis suggests adding more liquidity to solve problems, which user_6678322360 seems to accept. 

Another issue raised by user_6678322360 is about verifying the $Hood token. They mention needing $2k liquidity and a 1% spread on a $50 trade, but note pools with 2.5% spread might struggle. Kychuli says it's up to the team and they need more liquidity. The user also had a problem with their pool not showing up in searches, but kychuli and others suggest it might be due to liquidity dipping below the threshold. 

There's a mention of the pool being available after some time, possibly because the indexer takes a day to update. Other messages talk about Starname being a dead project, Coinbase listings, and some ATH (all-time high) references. The statbot links to support pages a couple of times.

Key points: Mobile support for creating positions isn't coming soon, need to use desktop. Verification requirements include liquidity and spread, which might be challenging. Pool visibility issues could be due to liquidity thresholds or indexing delays. Suggestions to add more liquidity. Also, some off-topic comments about Starname and Coinbase.

I need to structure the summary around these key issues and decisions, leaving out less relevant messages like the ATH and Coinbase ones unless they tie into the main discussion. Focus on the problems with mobile functionality, verification, and pool visibility, along with the team's responses and suggestions.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to understand the context of the text. Looking through the messages, they seem to be a series of comments from users on a platform, possibly related to cryptocurrency or blockchain, given mentions of Osmosis, pools, liquidity, and tokens like $Hood.

The main points I notice are around mobile support for creating positions in supercharged pools. Users are discussing issues with not being able to use mobile and needing desktop. There's also talk about verifying assets, which requires liquidity and spread percentages. Someone is asking if their token can ever be verified given the requirements. Then there's a part about a pool not showing up in search results, possibly due to liquidity thresholds. Other messages mention support directing them here, and some unrelated comments about Coinbase listings and ATH (All-Time High) for a token.

I should identify the key topics here. Mobile support for creating positions in supercharged pools is definitely a main topic. The verification of assets, specifically $Hood token, is another. The issue with the pool not appearing in search results because of liquidity or volatility comes up too. There's also the suggestion about needing more liquidity to solve problems. The unrelated parts about Coinbase and ATH might be separate topics, but maybe they're part of the same discussion? Wait, looking at the timestamps, the last few messages are from different users. The user_6678322360 starts with the pool issue, then others chime in. The messages from vta108 and Thanhdcb mention Coinbase listing and ATH, which might be a different topic altogether. But the user might want all main topics, even if they're separate.

So, the main topics seem to be:

1. Mobile support for creating positions in supercharged pools (users can't do this and are asking about plans).
2. Requirements for token verification (liquidity, spread percentages, specifically $Hood token's eligibility).
3. Pool visibility issues on Osmosis (pool not showing up in search, possibly due to liquidity thresholds).
4. Suggestions to increase liquidity for problem-solving (Arcmosis's advice to add more LP).
5. Coinbase listing impact on asset reliability (mentions of Coinbase listing and ATH).

I need to make sure these are the primary topics and not minor points. The messages about support

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. The user provided a series of chat messages from different people discussing issues related to Osmosis pools and a token called $Hood. The main question is whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message to understand the context. The user_6678322360 is having problems with creating a position on mobile for a supercharged pool and mentions that the team doesn't prioritize mobile support. Words like "brutal" and "not supported" seem negative. Kychuli and others explain that mobile isn't an option and they need more liquidity, which also sounds frustrating. There's mention of a pool not showing up unless certain conditions are met, which might indicate dissatisfaction.

Then there are some messages from other users like Arcmosis suggesting to put more liquidity, which could be neutral advice. Later, there's a message about Coinbase listing assets, and someone says "triple ATH üòé" which is positive. However, the majority of the conversation revolves around problems with mobile support, needing more liquidity, and the pool not appearing. These issues are causing inconvenience, so the sentiment here might be negative.

But wait, the user_6678322360 ends with thanking and saying they have goals, which is a bit positive. However, the main complaints about the platform's limitations probably outweigh that. The messages from the support bot are neutral. The last few messages about Coinbase and ATH are positive, but they might be separate from the main issue discussed earlier. 

I need to consider the overall tone. Most of the discussion is about problems and limitations, which are negative. The positive comments at the end might be a different topic (maybe about another token or news), so they might not affect the sentiment of the main conversation. The user's question is about the sentiment of the entire text, so I should check if the positive parts are related. The $Hood token issue is negative, while the Coinbase mention is positive but not directly related to the main problem. 

So the majority of the messages related to user_6678322360's problem are negative. The other positive messages are from different users and times, possibly unrelated. Therefore, the sentiment is likely negative.

The sentiment of the text is **negative**, primarily driven by the recurring frustrations and limitations

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any explicit or implicit actions that need to be taken.

Starting from the top, Yusungsang shared a link. Not sure if that's an action item, maybe just a reference. Then user_6678322360 says "ill give it a shot" and "noticed this too." Those might indicate they're going to try something, but the context isn't clear yet. Maybe related to the previous messages?

Looking further down, jasbanza mentions trying desktop mode on a mobile browser. That's a possible action item: test desktop mode on mobile. Then kychuli says "once you have a position you can view it on mobile but thats it :(" which suggests that creating a position isn't possible on mobile. User_6678322360 replies "brutal, ill relay the msg" ‚Äì so they might need to inform others about the mobile limitation.

Next, kychuli states that creating a position via mobile isn't supported and the team isn't prioritizing it. So the decision here is that mobile support for creating positions in supercharged pools isn't a priority. User_6678322360 mentions community members can't access a PC, so their next step might be to find alternative solutions for them.

The user asks if there are plans to add mobile support. Then there's a discussion about liquidity requirements for verified assets. Arcmosis suggests adding more liquidity (LP) to solve problems. User_6678322360 is concerned about meeting the 1% spread on trades and whether their token can be verified. Kychuli explains that if the token's price is volatile, it might drop below the minimum liquidity, causing visibility issues. The user provided a pool link and mentioned it doesn't show up in searches. Osmosis_statbot directs to support site, and kychuli advises opening a ticket. 

Later, kychuli mentions that the pool has been there the whole time, maybe liquidity fell below searchable amount. Then there's a comment about a starname being available but the project is dead. Other messages about Coinbase listing and ATH are more general and might not be action items.

Putting this together,
