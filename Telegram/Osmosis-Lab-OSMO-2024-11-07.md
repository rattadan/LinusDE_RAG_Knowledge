## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to go through each message and identify the main issues and actions.

Starting from the earliest messages: There's a mention of a meme coin called wosmo, and people are asking about the team behind it. Then, someone named griffin_web3 talks about a rug pull involving Trump coin and the Osmosis founder impersonator. Rug pull is a scam where developers abandon a project and take the funds, so that's a key point.

AlosKastanovnik has issues swapping USDt on Osmosis. They mention pool 1816 and liquidity problems. Mikebarb suggests opening a support ticket and checking pool 1835 as a workaround. The main issue here is liquidity shortage in specific pools, leading to swap difficulties. Decisions include trying different pools and contacting support.

Later messages refer to the age of the wosmo meme, with some users calling it a scam and a rug pull. There's a link to a Twitter post from Osmosis, maybe an official statement? Also, some users mention accounts being deleted, which might indicate the project is shutting down or being abandoned.

The key points are the liquidity issues on Osmosis for USDt to usdc swaps, the suggestion to use pool 1835, the rug pull allegations related to wosmo and Trump coin, and the community's reaction labeling it as a scam. Decisions made include opening support tickets, checking alternative pools, and discussions about the rug pull implications.

I should structure the summary to first address the liquidity problem and the workaround, then the rug pull and scam accusations, and finally the community's response. Need to keep it concise, so maybe group related points together without getting too detailed into each message. Also, note the timestamps to ensure the order of events is clear, but since the user didn't ask for chronological order, focus on the main issues and resolutions.

**Summary:**  
Users on Osmosis faced liquidity issues swapping "universal" USDT to other tokens (e.g., USDC) due to insufficient liquidity in pools like 1816, limiting withdrawals to Kava. A workaround via pool 1835 (USDT to USDC swap) was suggested, and support tickets were recommended for further assistance. Separately,

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this chat text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key themes or topics are.

Starting with the first few messages, there's a conversation between AlosKastanovnik and mikebarb about swapping USDt to USDC on Osmosis. They mention liquidity issues in pool 1816 and the need to open a support ticket. So liquidity problems and specific pools like 1816 and 1835 are topics. Also, Osmosis support is mentioned multiple times with the statbot links.

Then, there's a question from ecazaroto about the people backing the meme coin wosmo. That's another topic: meme coin backing. Later, Rekt_Zerker and others talk about wosmo being a rug pull, which relates to scams or rug pulls in general. They also mention Trump coin and a connection to Trump, so maybe Trump-related crypto projects or scams.

Other messages discuss issues with swapping on Osmosis, like not being able to convert USDt to Kava or USDC, which ties back to liquidity problems. There's a mention of the transmuter pool being drained by BasementNodes and griffin_web3 talking about Kava's end. So maybe cross-chain liquidity issues between Osmosis and Kava.

Some users like user_5318475127 and Rekt_Zerker mention migrating to Solana, which could be a topic about blockchain migration. There's also a support ticket reference and checking Osmosis accounts, so support processes might be another topic.

The meme coin Wosmo comes up several times, including its age and being a rug pull. So meme coins and rug pulls are recurring themes. Additionally, there's a link to a YouTube video and an X (Twitter) post from Osmosis, which might be promotional content or official announcements.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be:

1. Liquidity issues on Osmosis (specific pools like 1816, 1835)
2. Swapping problems between USDt, USDC, and Kava
3. Meme coin Wosmo and its backing (people behind it)
4. Rug pulls or scams related to Wosmo and Trump coin
5. Cross-chain

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this chat text. Let me start by reading through all the messages carefully.

The first message from AlosKastanovnik says "Yes it worked good". That seems positive. Then mikebarb mentions liquidity in the pool being good, which is also positive. But looking further, AlosKastanovnik has some issues: "Not yet. Just browsing for option but it should be working. Enabled swap button" ‚Äì that's neutral to slightly negative because they're having trouble but hopeful. 

Next, mikebarb asks if they swapped directly, and AlosKastanovnik says they found a workaround, which is positive. Then ecazaroto asks about the backers of a meme coin, which is neutral. 

But then there's a lot of negative messages. AlosKastanovnik can't convert USDt to Kava, mentions not being able to withdraw, which is negative. Others talk about liquidity issues, "rug pull", scams, deleted Twitter accounts, and "rip wosmo". Words like "rug", "scam", "rip", "drained" indicate strong negative sentiment. 

There are some neutral messages too, like the statbot links and a few other questions. The positive parts are about things working and liquidity being good, but those are in the minority. The majority of the messages are about problems, scams, and frustrations. 

I should check if the positive messages balance out the negative ones. The user mentions a workaround, but then the conversation shifts to rug pulls and issues with wosmo. The last few messages are definitely negative. 

Overall, considering the frequency and intensity of the negative words, the sentiment is negative. Even though there are a couple of positive statements, the main context is about problems and scams, which dominates the sentiment.

The sentiment of the text is **negative**.  

### Key Analysis:  
1. **Negative Themes**:  
   - Multiple users mention **liquidity issues** (e.g., "no liquidity between universal osmosis usdt and usdt.kava," "transmuter pool is drained").  
   - References to **rug pulls** and scams (e.g., "Wosmo token = rug," "Obvious scam," "Trump coin and the guy pretending to be the founder of Osmosis would do a rug pull").  
   - Frustration and resignation

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see if any of them indicate something that needs to be done, a decision made, or a next step.

Starting from the earliest message. The osmosis_statbot at 01:51:44 mentions visiting the support site if help is needed. That's a standard message, maybe not an action item unless someone needs to follow up. Then user_5318475127 at 11:02:32 says "saved the trouble" ‚Äì not sure what that refers to. At 11:10:07, they say "Rip wosmo üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ" which is more of a reaction than an action.

Looking at Rekt_Zerker's messages around 13:46:24: "oh wow trump and wosmo rugged" ‚Äì again, a comment on events, not an action. Then later messages about Twitter accounts deleted, checking if something still works, a tip, and a request to look at something. BasementNodes mentions a deprecated API at 14:15:02, which might be an action item if someone needs to address that. KeepHappy1011 asks someone to look at something, so maybe that's a next step.

Griffin_web3 at 14:15:21 says someone opened a ticket and sent Celatone. If someone opened a ticket, that's an action item. Then BasementNodes and griffin_web3 discuss liquidity issues, with typttt suggesting checking other swap routes or liquidity pools. AlosKastanovnik has several messages about swapping USDt to USDC, not being able to withdraw, and mentions enabling a swap button. Mikebarb asks them to open a ticket to check their account, and they found pool 1835 as a workaround.

So key points here are the liquidity issues on Osmosis for USDt to Kava, AlosKastanovnik finding a workaround in pool 1835, enabling the swap button, and mikebarb asking them to open a support ticket. Also, BasementNodes mentions a deprecated API, which might be an action item for the team to update or address
