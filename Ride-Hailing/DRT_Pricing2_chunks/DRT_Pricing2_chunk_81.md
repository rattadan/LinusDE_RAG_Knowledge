## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 81

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Only in settings with a highly utilized fleet
(𝐷𝑆𝑅 ∈ {70, 100}) and long allowed waiting times (𝑇𝑊 = 1029),
our strategy performs slightly worse than the global matching-based
strategy. However, in these settings, all tested strategies perform more
or less equally. The match missed requests strategy does not provide a
significant improvement compared to the nearest parking lot strategy in
our study. The iterative zone balance strategy performs slightly better for
low-utilized fleets as well as in settings without waiting time restrictions. In the remaining settings, there is no improvement observable. Both versions of the global matching strategy can improve the results
of the nearest strategy, often significantly. Additionally, the restricted
version achieves comparable results to the unrestricted version. The
main benefit of our strategy seems to be the lot-centric view, which
allows the positioning of vehicles very close to areas of high demand.
