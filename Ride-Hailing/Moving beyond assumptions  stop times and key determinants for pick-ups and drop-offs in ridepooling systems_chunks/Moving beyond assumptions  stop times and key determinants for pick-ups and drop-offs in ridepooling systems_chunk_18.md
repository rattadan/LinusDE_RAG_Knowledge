**Original Text:**

Ridepooling service ‘sprinti’
The sprinti-service, an on-demand ridepooling system, operates in the Hanover region (Germany) and is managed by the local PT company (GVH Hannover 2023). The operational
system is provided by Via (Via Transportation 2023). The service launched in June 2021 as
part of the PT system and covered three outlying districts around Hanover (Figure 2(a)). The areas have a suburban and rural character, with sparse population density and limited
PT. The introduction of sprinti aimed to enhance mobility options in the region, operating throughout the week from morning to late evening. Since its launch the service is
popular, as evidenced by the increasing number of bookings and passengers (Region of
Hanover 2024). Approximately 20% of trips are related to work, while over 50% are for
leisure purposes (Schneider, Koska, and Schäfer-Sparenberg 2024).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

* The ridepooling service 'sprinti' is an on-demand platform that operates in the Hanover region (Germany).
* The operational system is provided by Via Transportation.
* Sprinti launched as part of a PT (Public-Private) partnership in June 2021 and covers three outlying districts around Hanover.

**Context:**

The given text chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by providing specific details about ridepooling services, particularly 'sprinti', which is mentioned earlier. The reference list also discusses various aspects of urban transport systems, sustainability, simulation studies, disparities in travel times for accessing non-work destinations using ride-hailing services, and technological aspects like autonomous vehicles.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

* None explicitly stated in the given text chunk.
* However, the context suggests that there might be constraints such as geographical limitations (e.g., Hanover region in Germany) and operational requirements (e.g., limited population density, sparse population density).
* The availability of a public-private partnership (PT system) is also mentioned, which could imply financial or regulatory conditions.
