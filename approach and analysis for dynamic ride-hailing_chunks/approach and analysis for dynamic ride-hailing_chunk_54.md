I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

Is the timeframe too long, too many requests are estimated to arrive, and the demand might exceed the supply. In this case,
no zone will be saturated and the benefit of the restricted repositioning
vanishes. On the other hand, a timeframe that is too short will lead
to even worse solutions since fewer requests are estimated and the
restricted repositioning strategy will stop sending vehicles to demand

5.2. Proposed strategy
The aforementioned demand estimation-based strategies share two
big issues:
• The supply–demand-balancing is done on the basis of more or less
arbitrarily chosen zones, which are not directly connected to the
objective function. Due to the simplified modeling, it is implicitly
assumed that only vehicles within a certain zone can serve the
requests that arise in that zone. • The approaches do not explicitly consider the locations of the
parking lots. This can cause problems in settings where parking
lots are, at least in some areas, only sparsely available.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I'll provide a focused analysis of the specific section explaining what this chunk is explaining.

**Exact technical details, parameters, or processes described:**

The chunk mentions "satiated" and "unsaturated" zones, which implies that there are multiple regions (or zones) in a system where vehicles can be dispatched based on demand. The concept of zone saturation and unsaturation refers to the idea that if too many requests are placed in an area, it becomes saturated, and the benefits of repositioning vehicles to satisfy those demands vanish.

**Connection to or building upon surrounding context:**

This chunk is connected to the overall topic of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems. The surrounding text discusses various methods for managing demand, including simulation and modeling, rebalancing strategies, and demand forecasting. This chunk builds upon these concepts by highlighting a specific issue with current strategies (e.g., using arbitrary zones) that may lead to suboptimal solutions.

**Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

The text mentions the following requirements or constraints:

1. The demand should not exceed the supply.
2. There should be no zone saturation, meaning vehicles can be dispatched regardless of their location.
3. The repositioning strategy should minimize vehicle movement and reduce congestion.
4. The approaches must consider the locations of parking lots.

Overall, this chunk is explaining a specific limitation or pitfall in dynamic dispatch strategies that prioritize repositioning vehicles within a particular zone rather than considering the overall demand landscape.
