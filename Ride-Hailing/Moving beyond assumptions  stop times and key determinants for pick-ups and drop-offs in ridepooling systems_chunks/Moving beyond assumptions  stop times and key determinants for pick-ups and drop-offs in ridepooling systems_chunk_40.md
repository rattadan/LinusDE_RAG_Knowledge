Analyzing stop time distribution for drop-offs, the graph of the fitted
log-logistic CDF aligned very well with the empirical data across all stop times, even in
areas of exceeded stop times (Figure 6). In particular, the corresponding parameters of the
log-logistic distribution almost closely match the cumulative probability up to a stop time
of 25 s. Discussion
Our results indicate that stop times for PUDO events are heterogeneous, characterised by
a right-skewed distribution and a substantial range between the minimum and maximum
