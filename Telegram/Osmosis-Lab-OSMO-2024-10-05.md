## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this chat text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. Let me start by reading through each message to understand the context.

The first message is from osmosis_statbot at 11:51 AM UTC. It's directing users to the official support site if they need help. That's important because it's an official resource.

Next, user_7164487109 at 10:55 AM UTC mentions being an early user and getting help ASAP on Discord. So they're praising the support team's responsiveness. Then the same user at 10:54 AM says Osmosis's service is so good. Positive feedback about the service quality.

Khuwarzmi has a few messages starting at 9:26 AM. They suggest trying a link to portalbridge.com/cosmos, which might be a tool for Cosmos-related transactions. Then they say "Wait checking" and "They added 2 days ago I think." Maybe referring to a recent addition of a feature or support for a chain.

Dominik_lekki at 9:21 AM UTC asks how to withdraw Pyth to Solana because Portal doesn't have Cosmos. Wait, Portal not having Cosmos? But the previous message from Khuwarzmi was about portalbridge.com/cosmos. Maybe dominik is confused or there's a misunderstanding about which bridges are available. The key here is the user's request to move Pyth from Cosmos to Solana, and the mention that Portal doesn't support Cosmos, which might be a problem.

Putting this together: The main points are the user asking about withdrawing Pyth tokens from Cosmos to Solana using Portal, but Portal doesn't support Cosmos. Then Khuwarzmi suggests portalbridge.com/cosmos, possibly as an alternative bridge. The other messages are positive feedback about Osmosis's support. The decisions here might be the suggestion to use Portal Bridge for Cosmos, and the user being directed to official support if they need help.

I need to make sure the summary captures the problem (withdrawing Pyth to Solana, Portal not supporting Cosmos), the suggested solution (Portal Bridge link), and the positive service feedback. Also note the official support site. Avoid extra details, keep it concise.

**Summary:**  
A user inquired about withdrawing Pyth tokens from Cosmos to Solana, noting Portal

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. So the user provided a chat log with several messages, each from different users with timestamps. The task is to list the main topics as a comma-separated string.

First, I need to read through each message and identify what they're talking about. The first message is from osmosis_statbot, giving a link to the support site. That seems like support or official resources. Then user_7164487109 mentions being an early user and getting help ASAP on Discord. So maybe early users, Discord support, and quick assistance. Another message from the same user says Osmosis's service is good, so service quality is a topic here.

Next, Khuwarzmi shares a link to portalbridge.com/cosmos, which might relate to cross-chain bridges or Cosmos network. Then they mention checking something and that "they added 2 days ago," which could be recent updates or additions. 

Dominik_lekki asks about withdrawing Pyth to Solana and mentions Portal not having Cosmos. This seems like a question about token withdrawal, Pyth network, Solana, and maybe issues with Portal Bridge regarding Cosmos support. 

Putting this all together, the main topics would be: support site, early users, Discord support, service quality, portalbridge.com, Cosmos network, token withdrawal (specifically Pyth to Solana), Portal Bridge limitations, and recent updates. 

Wait, but I need to make sure these are the most relevant and not too specific. For example, the link to portalbridge.com might be about cross-chain bridges in general. The Pyth to Solana question is a specific transaction issue. Also, Osmosis is mentioned, so maybe Osmosis service or Osmosis platform. The user is asking how to do a withdrawal, which relates to blockchain transactions, maybe Solana blockchain, Pyth token, and cross-chain transfers. 

I should check if any topics overlap or can be grouped. For example, "Osmosis's service is so good" and the early user support both relate to Osmosis service/platform. The mention of Portal Bridge not supporting Cosmos is a separate topic. The main topics might be: Osmosis support, early user experience, service quality, cross-chain bridge (Portal Bridge), Cosmos network, Pyth token withdrawal, Solana blockchain, and recent updates.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a link to the support site. That's just providing information, so probably neutral. No clear positive or negative emotion there.

Next, user_7164487109 says, "As a early user,they always help me ASAP in discord." The user mentions being helped quickly (ASAP) and that's positive. Also, the fact that they're an early user and have had good experiences adds to the positive sentiment.

Then the same user writes, "Osmosis's service is so good." The phrase "so good" is clearly positive. That's a straightforward positive statement.

Khuwarzmi's first message is "Try this" followed by a link. It's a recommendation, which is positive because they're suggesting a helpful resource. Even though it's brief, the intent seems to be helpful, so positive.

The next messages from Khuwarzmi are "Wait checking" and "They added 2 days ago i think." The first is neutral, just indicating they're looking into something. The second is a factual statement about a recent addition, so also neutral.

Lastly, dominik_lekki asks, "How to withdraw pyth to solana? Portal dont have cosmos?" This is a question seeking help. The user might be frustrated, but the message itself doesn't express strong negative emotion. The mention that Portal doesn't have Cosmos could be negative, but since it's a question, maybe neutral. However, the "Portal dont have cosmos" part might indicate a problem, so possibly negative. But I should check if the user is just stating a fact or expressing dissatisfaction. Since it's a question, maybe they're looking for a solution rather than complaining. So maybe neutral.

Putting it all together: the bot message is neutral, two positive messages from user_7164487109, Khuwarzmi's "Try this" is positive, two neutrals from Khuwarzmi, and dominik_lekki's question is neutral. The overall sentiment would be positive because there are more positive statements than negative or neutral ones. Wait, but the neutral messages are more in number? Let me count again. There are six messages total. Two are positive

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully to see what's being discussed.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a link to the support site. That's probably an action item because it's directing users to seek help there. Then user_7164487109 mentions that as an early user, they get help ASAP in Discord. So maybe there's an action item here about contacting Discord support, especially for early users. The next message from the same user praises Osmosis's service, which might not be an action item but more of a positive feedback, so I'll note that as a decision or acknowledgment of good service.

Looking at Khuwarzmi's messages: they provided a link to portalbridge.com and said "Try this". That's definitely an action item suggesting the user try that link. Then they mention waiting to check and that something was added two days ago. The "Wait checking" could be a next step indicating they're looking into it. The message about something added two days ago might relate to a recent update, so that's a decision point or a note about recent changes.

Dominik_lekki's message is a question about withdrawing Pyth to Solana, noting that Portal doesn't have Cosmos. This indicates a problem they're facing. The action items here would be the need to find a solution for this withdrawal issue. Since Khuwarzmi responded with the portalbridge link, that's part of the next steps. Also, dominik_lekki might need to check if there's a recent update regarding this, as per Khuwarzmi's previous message.

Putting it all together, the main action items are visiting the support site, trying the portalbridge link, checking for recent updates, and possibly contacting Discord support. Decisions include acknowledging the good service and the recent addition mentioned. Next steps involve waiting for a response or checking on the status. I need to make sure each item is correctly categorized and not missing any details. Also, the user might be looking for a concise list without extra information, so I'll structure it clearly with bullet points under each category.
