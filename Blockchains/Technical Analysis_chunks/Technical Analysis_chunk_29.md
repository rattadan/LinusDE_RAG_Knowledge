**Original Text:**

They will streamline your trading routine and help you take advantage of every trading opportunity around the clock without needing to monitor the market all the time. – Create a trade with every order included, a Stop Loss, Take Profit and you can even connect a Trailing Stop order. Placing trades does not freeze the funds in your account, so you can create different scenarios and see which one plays out. – Programmable orders. A unique feature that allows you to program orders. For example, you place a buy order at $40,000 for Bitcoin. You can create the conditions that IF the order hits and fills, automatically a Stop Loss is placed at $38,000 and a Take Profit at $50,000.

This way you don’t need to scan the market for opportunities, you can simply place an alert and then potentially create a trade.
