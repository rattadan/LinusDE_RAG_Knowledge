There's also a community engagement aspect, as it's a question prompting interaction.

Language style and tone: It's friendly and upbeat, using emojis like ‚òÄÔ∏è and üñºÔ∏è. The use of "HODL" is common in crypto/NFT communities, indicating they're targeting an audience familiar with that jargon. The tone is casual and inviting, encouraging participation.

The tweet is promoting engagement with their platform, which is typical for official accounts. The username is "stargaze_intern," which might be a team member or a role within the project. The likes and replies are modest, so unless there's evidence of botting, it seems legitimate.
