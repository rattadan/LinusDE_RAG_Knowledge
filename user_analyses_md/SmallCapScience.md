- Suggesting market timing ("cooked Monday" meaning the market is down/ready for buying)
- Making confident predictions about price targets
- Using emojis and brevity typical of crypto Twitter hype

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
This account appears to be promoting specific investments without disclosing potential conflicts of interest. The style is typical of many crypto accounts that may be:
- Pumping their own holdings to create hype
- Making bold predictions without evidence
- Potentially trying to manipulate the market or encourage others to follow their trades

The lack of detailed analysis, the hype-oriented language, and the promoting of specific tickers all suggest this account should be viewed with caution rather than as a legitimate investment authority.
