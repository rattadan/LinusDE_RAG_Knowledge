## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided tweets.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The most recent ones are at the top, but the order in the input is from latest to earliest. Wait, actually looking at the timestamps, the first entry is from 2021-05-24T23:28:00, then the next is 23:27:39, and so on going back in time. But the user probably wants the summary in chronological order or just the key points regardless of time. Since the user didn't specify order, maybe just group the main updates.

The main things I see are:

- Cosmos SDK released a new version.
- CertiK collaboration for "Term of the Day" and educational content.
- IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) being highlighted, with Sentinel joining on May 29th.
- DeFi developments: Gravity coming to Cosmos, KavaSwap as a cross-chain liquidity hub.
- Token listings: $XKI on Blockfolio, AKT on Bittrex.
- Persistence mainnet hitting 50k transactions and supporting HackAtom HCMC.
- HackAtom HCMC event moving online from June 18th to July 2nd, sponsored by Cosmostation.
- Various other updates like Harpoon Protocol beta, Starname's crypto-pizza day, Sputnik adding coins, etc.
- Job posting for a Web Developer at FetchAI.
- Community engagement activities like a competition to guess why Akash is more famous, with a reward.

I need to make sure to mention the important announcements like SDK release, IBC progress, DeFi integrations, token listings, event updates, and collaborations. Also, note the stats like Persistence transactions and HackAtom details. Maybe group similar items together to avoid repetition. Check for any decisions or key actions mentioned, like joining IBC, enabling wallets, enabling staking actions, etc.

Wait, the tweet about the Akash Network Token (AKT) wallet being enabled at Bittrex is a key point. Also, the airdrop claiming steps coming soon. The CertiK partnership for education is another key point. IBC connecting chains is a major theme here. DeFi via Gravity and KavaSwap are important. Terra being part of Cosmos ecosystem. Swiss Borg

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The text consists of multiple tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, each with different announcements and discussions. First, I'll go through each tweet and note the key topics mentioned. 

The first tweet mentions a new Cosmos-SDK release. That's one topic: Cosmos SDK. Next, CertiK is backing with "Term of the Day," so CertiK is another topic. Then there's a tweet about IBC connecting all chains, so IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) is important here. 

Another tweet talks about $XKI being listed on Blockfolio, so that's a cryptocurrency listing. DeFi coming to Cosmos via 'Gravity' points to DeFi in the Cosmos context. Swiss Borg being an investor of Ki Chain introduces partnerships or investments. 

There's a mention of projects from Cosmos Ecosystem taking first and second places, which might relate to competitions or rankings. The Persistence mainnet surpassing 50,000 transactions is a milestone, so Persistence is a topic. 

"Conversations with Jack ft. Taariq Lewis" seems to be about community engagement or interviews. A job posting for a Web Developer at FetchAI indicates job opportunities. Artificial Intelligence for Blockchains is another topic, linking AI with blockchain tech. 

CertiK not just being on Twitter suggests their presence on other platforms. Terra being an ecosystem within Cosmos Ecosystem highlights Terra integration. KavaSwap as a cross-chain liquidity hub relates to DeFi and cross-chain solutions. 

The GreenNFT Hackathon ending and HackAtom HCMC happening online are about events. $FET staking overview is about staking mechanisms. Akash's popularity compared to other projects might relate to marketing or community growth. 

Airdrop claiming steps are about token distribution. Melea as a validator for Cosmos SDK chains is about validation services. Cosmostation being a Silver Sponsor for HackAtom HCMC is another partnership or sponsorship. 

Near and BSN collaboration is another partnership. Akash Network Token (AKT) being enabled on Bittrex Global is a cryptocurrency listing. Harpoon Protocol's public beta relates to new projects or launches. 

Weekly Cosmos Stats and Daily Cosmos Outpost are about updates and analytics. Citizen Cosmos podcast episodes are media-related. Starname's crypto-pizza day and their

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by looking through the provided content. The majority of the text consists of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. Each tweet is announcing updates, partnerships, or achievements related to the Cosmos network and its associated projects.

First, I'll go through each tweet to see if there are any negative words or phrases. The first tweet mentions a new Cosmos-SDK release, which is a positive update. The next one says they're glad CertiK is backing them, which is clearly positive. Then there's a tweet about IBC connecting all chains, which is a positive development. Another tweet mentions $XKI being listed on Blockfolio, which is a good thing for investors. DeFi coming to Cosmos via Gravity is also positive. Swiss Borg being an investor of Ki Chain is another positive partnership. The tweet about two Cosmos projects taking first and second place uses "Nice!" indicating approval. Persistence mainnet surpassing 50k transactions is a positive milestone. 

Other tweets mention AI for blockchains, CertiK's presence beyond Twitter, Terra's ecosystem, KavaSwap as a liquidity hub, educational content, articles about Persistence, airdrop details, validators, hackathons, and various other projects like Harpoon Protocol, Starname, and Cosmostation. These all seem to be neutral announcements or positive updates. 

There's a mention of a game with NFTs, collaborations between Akash and Solana, Regen Network's NFT art call, and a competition with a prize. Even the parts about needing to take actions for an airdrop are neutral, just informative. 

The user also included a podcast episode and a community bot update. The podcast discusses partnerships and plans, which is positive. The bot update adds more coins, which is a positive feature for users. 

The final message from Raul_SRE is a friendly greeting, which is neutral. 

Looking for any negative indicators: I don't see any words like "problem," "down," "issue," or complaints. All the tweets are about progress, new features, partnerships, or achievements. Even the questions posed in some tweets are meant to engage the community positively. 

Some tweets might be considered neutral if they're purely factual, like listing a coin or stating a date. However, the overall tone is enthusiastic, with words like "glad," "nice," "surpassed," "great

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, some retweets, and a couple of other messages.

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one and identify any specific actions, decisions, or next steps mentioned. Action items are usually things that need to be done, like tasks or announcements of upcoming events. Decisions might be about partnerships, updates, or new initiatives. Next steps could involve processes that users or teams need to follow.

Starting with the first few tweets. The tweet about the new Cosmos-SDK release doesn't specify an action item, just an announcement. The CertiK collaboration seems to be a promotional post. The IBC tweet is a statement, not an action. The $XKI listing on Blockfolio is a notification, not an action item. The DeFi via Gravity is also an announcement.

Looking at the tweet from 23:13:06 UTC, it mentions that there will be 4 actions needed to claim an airdrop, with more details coming. That's a clear action item for users to take note of upcoming steps. So that's one to extract.

The tweet at 23:01:45 UTC says HackAtom HCMC is happening online from June 18th to July 2nd, with Cosmostation as a Silver Sponsor. This is a next step for those interested in attending or participating as a sponsor.

Another one at 22:55:16 UTC mentions Sentinel joining IBC on May 29th. That's a specific date and action, so that's a next step for Sentinel and users to be aware of when Sentinel becomes part of IBC.

The tweet about KavaSwap being the cross-chain liquidity hub is more of an announcement. The CertiK "get the knowledges" is a call to action, but maybe not a specific step. The Persistence transaction milestone is just a statistic.

The GreenNFT Hackathon ending is a completion, not a next step. The job posting for a Web Developer at FetchAI is an action item for potential applicants, so that's another one to note.

The airdrop details, HackAtom dates, Sentinel joining IBC, and the job posting are the main points. Also, the KavaSwap launch
