I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

This is caused
by the prohibition of reassigning requests. The best moment to assign
a request to a vehicle would be exactly when the previous customer
is dropped off. Waiting longer wastes capacity due to unnecessary
idling, and assigning earlier (without allowing reassignment) would
disregard helpful information (e.g., new requests) arriving between the
assignment and the drop-off time. Which compromise is the best option
depends on the specific setting and can be taken from Table 2. Which cost calculation in the matching is the most appropriate
one? We compare four different cost calculations and associated objective functions for the matching-based approaches: minimizing distances
or travel times to the pickup locations; minimizing waiting times of
the customers; minimizing distances or travel times to the drop-off
locations; and maximizing reward gained by the assignment.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided text chunk, here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details:**
The specific technical details mentioned are:
- Spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network (Geng et al., 2019)
- Deep RL (Jiao et al., 2021)
- Approximate dynamic programming (Al-Kanj et al., 2020)

These techniques are used to solve the problem of demand forecasting in ride-hailing systems.

**Context:**
The current text chunk is explaining a specific issue related to dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems. The context is provided by referencing various references on the topic, including simulation models (Bischoff & Maciejewski, 2016; Braverman et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2018), dynamic dispatch strategies (Geng et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2021; Al-Kanj et al., 2020), and rebalancing strategies (Guo et al., 2021). The text also mentions a simulation platform (DIMACS Center for Discrete Mathematics: Hailing challenge [2]) and the availability of datasets or challenges (Ho et al., 2018).

**Connection to Surrounding Context:**
The current text chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:
