## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. The text includes several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and a message from citizenweb3.

First, I need to parse each tweet and identify the main announcements or decisions. Let's go through each one:

1. Introduction to Building Blockchain with Starport. That's an educational resource or event about using Starport for blockchain development.

2. Citizen Cosmos is hiring a part-time guru shitposter and community manager. They want someone involved with their podcast and validator, emphasizing meme creation and community management.

3. A comparison between Cosmos and Cardano ecosystems, suggesting Cosmos is bigger. Maybe a marketing or competitive point.

4. CertiK's emphasis on testing. Probably about security practices.

5. Secret and Terra collaboration. Indicates a partnership or alliance.

6. Starname after Stargate upgrade: allowing shorter names (3,2,1 letters). A product update.

7. Osmosis Day 3 with $30 million. Milestone or funding update.

8. Juno Network mainnet coming soon. Upcoming launch.

9. Validator Show event on June 26 discussing Osmosis post-genesis. Event details with participants.

10. 15th ICF Update. Regular update on development progress.

Then the unknown user's message about the Validator Show event details, listing validators and hosts. And the citizenweb3 job posting reiterating the community manager role.

Key points would be the job opening, ecosystem growth (Juno, Osmosis, Starname updates), partnerships (Secret-Terra), CertiK's testing, Validator Show event, and the ICF update. Also, the comparison with Cardano highlights competitive positioning.

I need to structure this into a summary, grouping similar items and highlighting decisions and announcements. Avoid redundancy, like the Validator Show is mentioned twice. Also, note the job posting from both tweets and citizenweb3's message. Mention the mainnet launches, funding milestones, and collaborations. Keep it concise but cover all major points.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each tweet and message to identify the key subjects.

Starting with the first few entries from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first one mentions Starport, so that's a topic. Then there's a job opening for a guru shitposter and community manager at Citizen Cosmos. Next, a comparison between Cosmos and Cardano ecosystems, highlighting Cosmos being bigger. CertiK is mentioned with testing, so that's another point. Secret and Terra being friends is a collaboration or partnership. Starname after Stargate upgrade talks about 3,2,1 letter names. Osmosis on day 3 with $30 million is about their funding or growth. Juno Network's main-net coming soon. The Validator Show event about Osmosis one week after genesis. The ICF Update is another topic.

Then there's a more detailed message about The Validator Show on June 26th, listing several validators involved. The topics here would include the event name, date, time, and the list of validators. But maybe the validators are more names than topics, so perhaps just the event itself. Also, the host and the platforms mentioned like YouTube.

The last message from citizenweb3 reiterates Citizen Cosmos looking for a community manager, so that's part of the job topic. They mention applying via a link and reaching out on Telegram.

Now, compiling all these. Need to avoid duplicates. For example, Citizen Cosmos's job posting appears twice. Also, The Validator Show is mentioned multiple times. Should combine those. Main topics would be:

- Introduction to Building Blockchain with Starport
- Citizen Cosmos job opening (part-time guru shitposter/community manager)
- Cosmos vs Cardano Ecosystem comparison
- CertiK emphasizing testing
- Secret and Terra partnership
- Starname Stargate upgrade (3,2,1 letters)
- Osmosis reaching $30 million on Day 3
- Juno Network main-net launch
- The Validator Show event (Osmosis one week after genesis)
- 15th ICF Update
- Validator Show details (date, time, participants, host)
- Job application process (Telegram contact, application link)

Wait, but the user might want the main topics without too much detail. Maybe some of these can be grouped. For instance, The Validator

*Frequently mentioned terms:*

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and another from citizenweb3. I need to determine the sentiment of each message as positive, negative, or neutral. 

Starting with the first tweet: "Introduction to Building Blockchain with Starport." That's straightforward. It's announcing a new resource or event, which is likely positive since it's about education and development, things that are generally seen as beneficial for growth.

Next, the second tweet mentions hiring for a part-time guru shitposter and community manager. The term "guru shitposter" is a bit unusual. It might be using humor or slang common in crypto communities. The sentiment here is probably positive because they're expanding their team, which indicates growth and activity.

The third tweet compares Cosmos Ecosystem to Cardano, stating Cosmos is "much more bigger." The phrase starts with "We don't want to say nothing bad about Cardano..." which is a double negative, so they're trying to avoid negativity but still make a comparison. The sentiment here is positive for Cosmos but might be slightly negative towards Cardano. However, since the focus is on promoting their own ecosystem, overall positive.

Fourth tweet: "CertiK: Test, test, and test again." Emphasizes thorough testing, which is a positive trait in blockchain development, showing commitment to quality and security.

Fifth: "Secret and Terra are friends!" Friendly tone, highlighting a partnership or good relations, so definitely positive.

Sixth: Starname's Stargate upgrade details. Announcing new features (3,2,1 letter starnames) is positive as it indicates progress and enhancement.

Seventh: Osmosis Day 3 with $30 million. Financial milestones are usually positive, showing success and growth.

Eighth: Juno Network mainnet coming soon. Anticipation of a mainnet launch is positive, signaling development progress.

Ninth: The Validator Show event details. Promoting an educational event is positive, as it's about community engagement and knowledge sharing.

Tenth: 15th ICF Update. Neutral, as it's just an update without explicit positive or negative language.

The unknown message at the end is about the same Validator Show event, with enthusiastic emojis and exclamation points, so positive. The citizenweb3 message is similar to the earlier job posting, so positive as well.

I need to check each for any

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text includes several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem and one from citizenweb3. 

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. Starting with the most recent. The latest message is from citizenweb3 at 12:47 UTC, which is a job posting. They're looking for a part-time community manager with specific skills: guru shitposter and meme-master. The application link is provided, and they mention reaching out via Telegram. So that's a clear action item for interested candidates.

Then, looking at the earlier tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first one mentions an introduction to building a blockchain with Starport. That's an educational resource, so maybe a next step for someone interested in development would be to check that out. 

Another tweet is about Citizen Cosmos hiring a part-time guru shitposter and community manager. Wait, there's a similar job posting from citizenweb3. Maybe they're related? The user might want to list both, but actually, the citizenweb3 message seems to be a repost or more detailed version of the earlier tweet. So perhaps just the citizenweb3 one is the main action item here.

There's a tweet about CertiK emphasizing testing. Not sure if that's an action item unless they mention a specific action to take, like "test your code" or something. But it's more of a statement. Similarly, the Secret and Terra being friends is a statement, not an action. 

The Starname tweet after the Stargate upgrade mentions shorter names. Maybe that's a next step for users to register those names now that they're available? But the tweet itself doesn't explicitly say to do that. It's more of an announcement. 

Osmosis Day 3 with $30 million is a milestone, but again, unless there's a call to action, like participating in something, it's just information. The Juno Network mainnet coming soon is an update, but no specific action mentioned. 

The Validator Show on June 26th at 15:00 UTC is an event. The user might need to note the date and time as a next step to attend. Also, the ICF Update is a report or document that needs to be read, but the tweet just mentions it's available.
