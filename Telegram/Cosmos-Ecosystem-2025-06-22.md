## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. Let me start by going through the messages to see what's important.

First, there's a lot of discussion about LUNC and Terra Classic. Nicolas_Boulay mentions a blockchain audit with Oak Security, and others like Rummy_CFL agree, emphasizing trust. They're finalizing audit details with Oak and Blamefrag. The audit is a big deal to regain investor trust. Also, they talk about the Cosmos ecosystem, with three DEXs available: Garuda Dex, Terraport, Terraswap, and Native USDC integration. Vyntrex.io is recommended for tracking pools.

Then there's a lot of bot interactions. Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot is active, discussing DePIN infrastructure using H3 grids for geospatial staking and validator rewards. They want to prototype validator reward models using nRide's mechanics. MissRose_bot and others are around, but some users are annoyed by the bot's random responses. K_raucks suggests making the bot pingable instead of random.

Discord link shared by user_7151168156 for Terra Classic community. Pandainfame mentions an airdrop from Backbone Labs. There's also talk about CAC (Cosmos Airdrop Community) and their tokenomics, with some users skeptical about its value and utility. Igorsoares62 and others debate USTC's utility, suggesting it needs real-world use cases beyond speculation. The idea of using USTC for gas fees is floated to generate yield.

Rattadan and others discuss bots, AI frontends, and memecoins, criticizing speculative projects. They mention a potential CAC treasury and OTC swaps via CACSwap. There's a proposal in CAC DAO about package delivery and housekeeping, which passed. Also, some random stuff about Trump's impact on crypto and a Telegram wallet integration.

Key points: Audit for LUNC, DePIN infrastructure with H3 grids, DAO governance, CAC and USTC utility discussions, Discord link promotion, and bot-related interactions. Decisions include proceeding with the audit, using Vyntrex.io, and CAC DAO proposals passed. Need to filter out the noise like memes, off-topic comments, and focus on the main actions and agreements.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or key subjects.

Looking at the text, there's a lot of discussion about blockchain audits. Nicolas_Boulay mentions a blockchain audit with Oak security, and others like Rummy_CFL agree on the importance of audits for trust. So "blockchain audit" is definitely a main topic.

Then, there's a lot of talk about Terra Classic (LUNC) and its community. User_7151168156 shares a Discord link for Terra Classic, and several users mention LUNC, so "Terra Classic (LUNC)" is another topic. Also, "USTC" comes up in discussions about utility and tokenomics, so that's part of the same theme.

Discord link promotion is mentioned by user_7151168156, so that's a separate point. They provided a link to the OG Discord, so "Discord community promotion" might be a topic here.

DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) is discussed by Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot multiple times, linking it with USTC and validator rewards. That's a technical focus, so "DePIN infrastructure" is a main topic.

Validator operations and staking are also mentioned a few times, especially in relation to Cosmos and Solana. Nicolas_Boulay talks about validator rewards, and Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot brings up validator UX drafts. So "validator operations" and "staking mechanisms" should be included.

There's a mention of airdrops by Pandainfame and others, so "airdrop announcements" or "airdrop discussions" would be a topic. The backbone labs airdrop is specifically noted.

Bot interactions are frequent here. MissRose_bot, Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot, and others are responding to users, so "bot interactions" is a key element. Also, there's a request to make the bot pingable instead of random responses, which ties into this.

Discussions about tokenomics and utility for USTC and LUNC come up, like generating yield through gas fees. Igorsoares62 and others talk about this, so "token utility" and "tokenomics" are relevant.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from a group, and I need to figure out if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The earliest messages are from Rattadan and others discussing technical aspects like blockchain audits, DePIN infrastructure, DAO governance, and tokenomics. There's a lot of talk about projects like nRide, Coreum, and Cosmos ecosystem. They mention things like "blockchain audit incoming" and "utility-first design," which seem positive because they're about improvement and development.

Then there's a message from MissRose_bot about banning someone, which is a bit negative, but it's just a bot action. Other messages talk about airdrops, giveaways, and some promotional links. The user_7151168156 says "Lunc! Lunc! Lunc!" which is enthusiastic, so positive. 

Some messages are neutral, like Pandainfame's "I just did some shopping" or Tomhomes greeting. But there's also some sarcasm and criticism, like "memecoins make fun with trojan during bullphases" which is negative. Rattadan calls something a "clownshow" and mentions "swapped via cacswap," which might be neutral or slightly negative depending on context.

Looking at the later messages, there's more technical discussion about validators, staking, and blockchain development. However, there are also some negative comments like "CMC is hacked" and "scam group I think." But then someone says "we are so back" which is positive. 

The bots like CoinhallBot and banBabyBot provide neutral information about prices and commands. The dao_dao_notifier_bot messages about proposals being executed are neutral updates. 

Now, I need to balance the positive and negative. The majority of the messages are discussing technical developments, audits, and project improvements, which are positive or neutral. There are some negative remarks but they are not the majority. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive because the community is engaging in constructive discussions about their projects and there's enthusiasm, even though there are some criticisms and negative comments. 

I should check if there's any strong negative language that tips the scale. Phrases like "clownshow," "scam group," "hacked and scamming" are negative, but they're

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, and next steps from this text. The user provided a bunch of chat messages, and I need to parse through them to identify any concrete tasks or plans mentioned.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The earliest messages are from 2025-06-22T00:09:12+00:00 up to 2025-06-23T00:27:14+00:00. Let me start from the top.

Looking at Nicolas_Boulay's message at 2025-06-22T23:08:21+00:00: "Blockchain audit incoming with Oak security". That sounds like a decision or next step. So maybe action item is to conduct a blockchain audit with Oak Security. Then Rummy_CFL at 23:13:11 asks about the cost, and Nicolas at 23:22:08 mentions finalizing details with Oak and #Blamefrag to get a number. So the next step is finalizing audit details with Oak and Blamefrag.

Another thing: user_7151168156 at 23:23:19 shares a Discord link. So maybe the action item is joining the Discord community. Then at 23:27:16, Rummy_CFL concurs and agrees an audit is important. So the audit is a decision made.

Also, Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot has several messages. For example, at 21:42:25, they mention stress-testing Coreum's Smart Token compliance and nRide's H3 geospatial logic against USTC's design. So action items here might involve prototyping validator reward models using nRide‚Äôs resolution-level staking mechanics. The bot also asks for help from Engin_Yildiz_80 and K_raucks to stress-test the model.

Igorsoares62 at 21:42:09 talks about generating yields through gas fees and using USTC as gas fee. So next step could be exploring gas fees as a yield generator for USTC.
