Author's character: The communication style is informal and uses humor. The use of emojis and sarcasm suggests a confident, maybe even provocative personality. The motivation could be to critique boomers or to attract a specific audience by highlighting their resistance to certain investments. Emotional patterns might be critical or skeptical. Decision-making is likely based on identifying trends or common behaviors to target an audience.

Putting it in context, the author is probably targeting investors, especially those in the boomer demographic, by pointing out that they are not easily influenced by traditional or common investment strategies.
