1. **Main topics/themes discussed**: The tweets discuss two main topics - the inefficiency of some airports (SFO) and AI customization, with a hint of criticism towards humans being sheep-like in their markets.
2. **Language style and tone**: The language is informal, sarcastic, and slightly condescending. Tone is critical, with a touch of humor.
3. **Key characteristics of communication**:
	* Uses rhetorical questions (e.g., "longest line by far at SFO") to engage the audience.
	* Makes light-hearted jabs at humans ("sheep-like"), using irony and exaggeration.
	* Employed contractions ("can't" instead of "cannot") for a more casual tone.
4. **Which Ecosystem or project**: The tweets seem to be from an individual, possibly a travel blogger or commentator, as they are sharing their opinions on airports and AI customization.

**Bigger context:**

* The original tweet is likely from someone who has been following the development of airport security checks, specifically SFO's Precheck program.
