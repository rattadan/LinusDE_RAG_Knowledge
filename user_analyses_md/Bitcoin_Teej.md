- The tweet doesn't make unrealistic claims or promises
- It's not promoting any specific product or service, just explaining how the system works
- The advice to "Never sell" is a subjective investment philosophy that has followers in the crypto space (often called "HODLing") but isn't necessarily appropriate for all investors

Putting this tweet in context:
This tweet appears to be educating followers about alternative ways to utilize Bitcoin rather than selling it.

This aligns with the broader Bitcoin maximalist philosophy that advocates should hold BTC rather than sell it, as they believe in its long-term appreciation potential.

The numbered format suggests the author often shares structured information, breaking down complex topics into digestible parts. The focus on financial applications of Bitcoin (rather than just price talk) suggests they want to help people understand practical uses of the technology.
