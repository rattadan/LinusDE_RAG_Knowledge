## Chunk 45

**Original Text:**

•

T1(A) AND T2(B)
Party A never funded their account. Party B can Cancel before T2 to get their funds
back, but even if they wait until after T2, they will still get their deposit back. •

T2(A) & Approve(B, secret_a)
Symmetrical to output 4. •

T2(A) & Cancel(B)
Symmetrical to output 8. •

T2(A) AND T1(B)
Symmetrical to output 12.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I can help you understand the pattern behind these combinations.

Let's break down each combination:

T1(A) AND T2(B)
- Party A never funded their account (A), so this is impossible, and we'll ignore it.
- Party B can Cancel before T2 to get their funds back, but even if they wait until after T2, they will still get their deposit back.

T2(A) & Approve(B, secret_a)
- This combination is symmetrical to output 4. The "approve" action from Party A matches the input of Party B, and since Party B can cancel before T2 (without losing anything), this combination outputs the same value as when the other actions are reversed.

T2(A) & Cancel(B)
- Symmetrical to output 8. This is likely because this combination is equivalent to the previous one: Party A never funded their account, so they won't get their deposit back if they're not approved by Party B (Action 1), and Party B will cancel if there's no approval from Action 2.

T2(A) AND T1(B)
- This combination is symmetrical to output 12. The "approve" action from Party A matches the input of Party B, just like in other combinations where the inputs are reversed (like 4 and 8), so this combination outputs the same value as when the other actions are reversed.

So, the pattern here seems to be that each pair of combinations is symmetrical to output a specific value. The exact values match what we would expect from combining these operations without any conditions (i.e., Party B can always cancel and get their deposit back).
