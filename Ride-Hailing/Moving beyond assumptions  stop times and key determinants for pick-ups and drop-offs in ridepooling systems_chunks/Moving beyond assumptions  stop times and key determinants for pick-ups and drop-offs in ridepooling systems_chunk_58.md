**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is explaining the methodological distribution of virtual stops for ride-pooling, which refers to the placement and timing of virtual stops (e.g., designated pickup or drop-off points) within an urban transportation system using simulation models.

Here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details:**
- The use of virtual stops is a key aspect of ride-pooling services, allowing for efficient routing and optimization of vehicle movements.
- Simulation models like MATSim are commonly used to analyze and optimize the placement of virtual stops in various urban transportation systems.
- The references cited (Hörl et al., 2018; Hörl & Zwick, 2021) demonstrate an understanding of fleet control algorithms for automated mobility, which is closely related to ride-pooling operations.

**Context Connection:**
The current text chunk connects to the surrounding context by mentioning various research papers and reports on urban transport systems and sustainability, including the use of simulation tools like MATSim. This information provides a broader understanding of the field of transportation research, which is relevant to the discussion of ride-pooling services.

**Requirements and Conditions:**
