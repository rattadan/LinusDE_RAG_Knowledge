## Chunk 12

**Original Text:**

In addition to the expenses to the agency for running the service, it is also necessary to account for the costs that users endure to use the service. To this end, Vickrey's (1969) congestion theory is adapted to approximate the costs that the DRT users experience for the service when the operating capacity of the system is inadequate to meet the demand. In this case, the user equilibrium can be conceived as the result of competition between DRT users who are each minimizing their own travel costs, which include the waiting time to be picked up, the traveling time in the vehicle, and the cost for arriving earlier or later than preferred. In an equilibrium condition, no one has an incentive to change his or her own travel time. However, it is still possible to reduce the total costs of the system by optimizing the DRT operations and managing the temporal distribution of demand.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This passage discusses Vickrey's (1969) congestion theory and its application to the design of a Demand Response Transit (DRT) system. It explains how users can be incentivized to use the service, even if it means operating at inadequate capacity, by minimizing their own travel costs.

The key points mentioned in the passage include:

1. Vickrey's congestion theory is adapted to account for user costs when the system's operating capacity is not sufficient to meet demand.
2. The user equilibrium is a concept where DRT users compete with each other to minimize their travel costs, which includes waiting time, traveling time, and arriving earlier or later than preferred.
3. In an equilibrium condition, no one has an incentive to change their travel time, but it's still possible to reduce total costs by optimizing DRT operations and managing demand distribution.

Overall, the passage highlights the importance of considering user costs when designing efficient transportation systems like DRTs. By understanding how users are incentivized to use the service, operators can optimize their operations to minimize costs while still providing a useful service.
