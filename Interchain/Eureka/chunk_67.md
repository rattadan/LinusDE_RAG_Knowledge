## Chunk 67

**Original Text:**

When the Relayer comes back online after 8 minutes, it relays a timeout message to Osmosis, releasing the user’s STRIDE, which gets forwarded to their Osmosis address
In a post-swap error, the user will end up with their destination asset tokens in their address on the chain where the swap took place (e.g. STRIDE on Osmosis in this example)

Axelar Failures
Axelar transfers can be tracked on Axelarscan. Often, Axelar transfers are delayed by Axelar’s relayer or execution services. If a transaction is taking longer than expected, users can visit Axelarscan, find their transaction, and manually execute the steps needed to get the transfer through.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you've provided a passage about the Relayer's behavior in the context of Axlear (Axelar) blockchain. Here's a breakdown of what each part is saying:

1. When the Relayer comes back online after 8 minutes, it relays a timeout message to Osmosis.
2. This means that if there's an issue with the Relay's communication or processing time, it will notify Osmosis, which can then take manual action to resolve the issue.
3. In case of a post-swap error (an error that occurs after a successful swap), the user's destination asset tokens will be released in their Osmosis address instead of where they were expected.

To summarize: Axlear's Relayer is a critical component, but it can experience delays or failures. If issues arise, users can take manual action to resolve them and ensure accurate transfer tracking on Axelarscan.
