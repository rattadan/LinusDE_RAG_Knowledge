## ICS - Chunk 41

**Document Summary:**

The development of Interchain Security (ICS) for the Cosmos ecosystem represents a significant milestone that paves the way for greater interoperability, security, and economic growth among blockchain networks. Here are some key points summarizing the current state and future outlook:

### Key Achievements:
1. **Replicated Security Launch:**
   - The first consumer chains have successfully launched with replicated security, sharing the validator set of the Cosmos Hub.
   - This model ensures that any attack on a consumer chain would impact the entire ecosystem as much as it would affect the Cosmos Hub itself.

2. **Opt-in Security Development:**
   - Informal Systems and other contributors are working to develop opt-in security, allowing validators to choose which chains they wish to secure independently.
   
3. **Subset Problem Resolution:**
   - The "subset problem" has been identified and is being addressed through the design of new governance proposals, like slash proposals, to mitigate potential attacks.

4. **Mesh Security Research:**
   - Ongoing research into mesh security aims to create a network of interdependent blockchains where validators can participate in multiple chains without compromising security.

### Upcoming Steps:
1. **Opt-in Security Implementation:**
   - Finalizing and deploying opt-in security will provide more flexibility for validators, allowing them to distribute their staked ATOM across different consumer zones.

2. **Mesh Security Design:**
   - Continuing the research and development of mesh security to ensure a robust and secure network of interconnected blockchains.
   
3. **Economic Zone Development:**
   - The ATOM Economic Zone is expected to bring innovative economic opportunities for its members, such as shared validator sets and enhanced inter-IBC functionalities.

4. **Interoperability Enhancements:**
   - Improving IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) functionality, including synchronous IBC, atomic IBC, and packet forwarding, to enhance user experience and security across the ecosystem.

### Long-term Vision:
1. **Sustainable Ecosystem Growth:**
   - By sharing the same validator set, consumer chains can benefit from increased security without needing their own validators, reducing costs and improving overall network resilience.
   
2. **Increased Adoption and Innovation:**
   - The interdependent nature of these blockchain networks is expected to drive innovation and adoption, as developers can leverage the combined strengths of multiple blockchains.

3. **Economic Opportunities:**
   - ATOM holders and validators will have more avenues for earning transaction fees and MEV (Miner Extracted Value) rewards across various zones.
   
### Conclusion:
The launch of Interchain Security marks a significant advancement in the interoperability landscape, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure blockchain ecosystem. As development continues, the Cosmos ecosystem is poised to offer new opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration among its members.

**Original Text:**

Stride, the largest liquid staking provider in Cosmos, placed its proposal on the forum on April 14 and then on-chain on April 27. Prop 794 passed on May 12 to make Stride the second consumer chain approved to launch, in the coming days. Unlike Neutron, which launched to mainnet on replicated security, Stride protocol launched in 2022 and will carry out a chain upgrade to swap out the existing Stride validator set with the Cosmos Hub validator set. You can find further details about this in Strideâ€™s roadmap for 2023 here. Rewards for ATOM Validators and Delegators
According to the initial security agreement, Cosmos Hub will receive 25% of transaction fees for providing security to Neutron, fees that will be collected by ATOM holders and validators. Neutron has also proposed to share 25% of its MEV revenue. Cosmos Hub will receive and share additional NTRN rewards with ATOM validators and delegators from transaction fees and MEV bids, as well as extra ATOM from transaction fees.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the text chunk:

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

1. **Security Agreement:** The text mentions that "initial security agreement" has been established between Cosmos Hub and Stride (neither of which is a technical term in itself), indicating some level of formalized agreement on security responsibilities.
2. **Transaction Fees:** The chunk discusses the transfer of 25% of transaction fees from Neutron to Cosmos Hub, as well as sharing of MEV revenue. This suggests an involvement of ATOM holders and validators in the ecosystem's financial operations.

**Connection to or Building upon the Surrounding Context:**

1. **Overview of ICS:** The text provides a high-level overview of Interchain Security (ICS) for the Cosmos ecosystem, highlighting its significance in terms of interoperability, security, and economic growth.
2. **Stride's Proposal:** Stride's proposal on the forum and then on-chain is mentioned as a key event, indicating that ICS has been actively developed and adopted within the ecosystem.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. **Community Involvement:** The text emphasizes the importance of community involvement in the development and adoption of Interchain Security.
2. **Validator Participation:** Stride's proposal highlights the need for validators to participate in the security process through the on-chain upgrade of their validator sets.
3. **Economic Viability:** The mention of rewards for ATOM Validators and Delegators suggests that there may be economic considerations involved, although specific details are not provided.

Focus:

The focus of this chunk is on explaining the technical aspects of Interchain Security (ICS) within the context of the Cosmos ecosystem. Specifically, it addresses how Stride's proposal has been integrated into the larger ICS framework, highlighting community involvement and validator participation as crucial factors in its adoption.
