## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 101

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

Overlapping area calculations

The new shift 𝛥 in 𝑥 and 𝑦 direction after rotating the coordinate system
by 45◦ can be calculated based on the original shift 𝛥′ as follows:
√
2| ′ 2
2|
𝛥𝑥 =
(11)
|𝛥 𝑥 − 𝛥′ 𝑦 |
|
2 |
√
2| ′ 2
2|
𝛥𝑦 =
(12)
|𝛥 𝑥 + 𝛥′ 𝑦 |
|
2 |

To handle the supply and demand calculations precisely, the overlaps of different zones have to be calculated. The radius of a zone is
equivalent to the maximum waiting time 𝑇𝑊 of the requests, so that
all requests arising in a zone can be served by vehicles placed in the
parking lot in the center of the zone within the time limit. Similar
zones (with the same radius) can also be created around a vehicle or a
request. In case of a request-based zone, a vehicle would have to be
inside this zone to be able to reach this request in time. The shape
of these zones depends on the used distance metric. For Euclidean
distances, the zones form a circle with a radius of 𝑇𝑊 (in terms of
driving time).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

1. **Shift in coordinate system**: A shift is applied to calculate overlapping areas between different zones.
2. **Zone calculation**: The overlaps are calculated using the original shift (`𝛥′`) and a rotation angle (45◦) of 180 degrees.
3. **Radius of zone**: The radius of a zone is equivalent to the maximum waiting time (`𝑇𝑊`) of requests, which ensures that all requests arising in a zone can be served by vehicles placed in the parking lot within the time limit.

**Connections to surrounding context:**

This chunk connects to the broader discussion about ride-hailing systems and their operations, specifically highlighting the importance of calculating overlapping areas between different zones. This is relevant to various studies mentioned in the reference text, such as dynamic trip-vehicle assignment, spatio-temporal demand forecasting, and fleet management.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

1. **Euclidean distance metric**: The shape of zones depends on the Euclidean distance metric used.
2. **Driving time**: The radius of a zone is equivalent to the maximum waiting time (`𝑇𝑊`) of requests, which implies that the driving time should be sufficient for all vehicles to serve requests within the time limit.

Overall, this chunk provides technical details about calculating overlapping areas between different zones in ride-hailing systems, highlighting the importance of using an Euclidean distance metric and ensuring sufficient driving time.
