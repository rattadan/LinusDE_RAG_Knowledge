1. Main topics/themes discussed:
- Cryptocurrency in general
- Selectivity in cryptocurrency projects (implying some are more promising than others)

2. Language style and tone:
- The language is brief and to the point, but uses "&amp;" which is HTML code for "&" suggesting this might be raw data or an automated posting system

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
- The tweet itself doesn't contain overtly suspicious or scam-like language
- It's general advice rather than a specific investment recommendation
- No links to dubious websites or "get rich quick" promises

- The message is vague about what makes a cryptocurrency "go all the way" without specific criteria

4. Which ecosystem/project is advertised?
- No specific cryptocurrency or ecosystem is mentioned in this tweet
- The message appears to be general crypto advice rather than promotion of a specific project
