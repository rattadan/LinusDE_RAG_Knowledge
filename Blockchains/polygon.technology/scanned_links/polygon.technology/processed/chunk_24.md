### Document Overview  
This content explains how Polygon Labs uses cookies, distinguishing between first-party and third-party cookies, their purposes, and the role of other tracking technologies like web beacons.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **First-party cookies**: Set by the website owner (Polygon Labs), used for essential functionality and user experience.  
- **Third-party cookies**: Set by external parties, enabling features like ads, analytics, and interactive content.  
- **Essential/strictly necessary cookies**: Required for site operation, such as login or navigation.  
- **Web beacons**: Tiny images used to track user activity, often reliant on cookies for functionality.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Cookie distinctions**: First-party cookies are tied to the domain, while third-party cookies are associated with external domains.  
- **Tracking technologies**: Web beacons are used alongside cookies to monitor traffic, improve performance, or track user behavior.  
- **Cookie functionality**: Declining cookies may impair the use of third-party features (e.g., ads, analytics) or tracking tools.  
- **Variability**: Specific cookie types (e.g., session cookies, analytics cookies) may differ per site, depending on the service or functionality.  

### Related Topics  
- **Cookie policies**: The document connects to broader privacy and cookie management practices (e.g., user consent settings).

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Polygon Labs) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies." Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Site (e.g., like advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer or device when it visits the website in question. â

We use cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Sites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to understand the interests of our website visitors and users to enhance the user experience on our Sites. Third parties serve cookies through our Sites for our own advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below. The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Sites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Sites you visit).

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or opened an email from us. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns to our Sites, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to improve Site performance or our Services overall, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functionality.
