Legitness evaluation. The account is retweeting from others like Cade Bergmann and Bob Murphy, which might add credibility. However, the content is mostly about crypto projects and market trends. It's possible that the account is a crypto influencer or a project promoter, but without more info, it's hard to say if they're trustworthy.
