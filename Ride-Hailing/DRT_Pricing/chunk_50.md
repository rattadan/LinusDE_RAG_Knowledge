Computation time [sec]

Using the DRT speed up module has a significant impact on the computational performance. In iterations where the
DRT mode is simulated in a simplified way, the computation time is reduced by approx. 30-60 minutes per iteration
compared to the detailed simulation (every 10th iteration), depending on the total number of simulated DRT users (see
Fig. 1a). Also, as shown in Fig.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The text describes how using the DRT speed up module can significantly impact computational performance by reducing the computation time.

It states that:

* In simplified simulations, the computation time is reduced by approximately 30-60 minutes per iteration compared to detailed simulations.
* The reduction in computation time depends on the total number of simulated DRT users and the specific details of the simulation.

Additionally, a figure (Fig. 1a) appears to show the relationship between the number of iterations and the computation time, with DRT mode potentially offering significant speedups in certain iterations.
