## Chunk 11

**Original Text:**

Ride-hailing applications can integrate the registry
into their platform, giving them access to a pool of self-governed, verified, and independent drivers that
riders can hail from. On the driverâ€™s side, nRide provides the capability to accept hail requests from all
nRide-compatible applications. Our peer-to-peer messaging protocol provides a secure and efficient
means for riders and drivers to negotiate rides directly, without intermediaries. Riders can broadcast a ride
request to drivers within their vicinity, and drivers can bid on the request by naming their price. This gives
riders the ability to choose a driver that best fulfills their needs, whether they are price-sensitive or quality
sensitive.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing the integration of the "Registry" into ride-hailing applications, such as nRide, and how this can be leveraged by both riders and drivers.

To summarize, here's a breakdown of what you've mentioned:

1. **Integration with Registry**: Ride-hailing applications like nRide can integrate their platform to access a pool of self-governed, verified, and independent drivers. This enables them to connect riders with trusted and reliable drivers.
2. **Driver Acceptance**: Drivers on the nRide-compatible application can accept hail requests from other compatible apps directly within their vicinity. They can also bid on ride requests by setting their own prices.
3. **Peer-to-Peer Messaging Protocol**: The peer-to-peer messaging protocol allows riders to send ride requests to drivers in their area, while drivers can respond with their availability and estimated costs (prices). This enables a direct and secure communication process between parties without intermediaries.

By implementing these features, nRide is likely creating a more seamless, efficient, and convenient experience for both riders and drivers. It seems to be facilitating peer-to-peer interactions within the ride-hailing ecosystem, which can lead to increased trust, flexibility, and satisfaction among users.
