# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_51.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.base.org/*

### Document Overview  
The content highlights Base.org's platform features, including low gas fees, strong liquidity, and community support, while discussing challenges like scalability and the importance of experimentation in blockchain development.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Onchain logic**: Blockchain-based functionality integrated into applications.  
- **Low gas fees**: Cost-effective transaction processing for scalability.  
- **Smart contracts**: Self-executing contracts with conditions encoded in code.  
- **Liquidity**: Access to real-world assets and market participation.  
- **Community support**: Collaborative ecosystem with events like Base Camp.  
- **Base Camp**: Platform event for builders to meet, share ideas, and collaborate.  
- **Paymaster**: Tool for sponsoring transactions, enabling low-cost on-chain operations.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Low gas fees**: Base offers minimal transaction costs, enabling large-scale on-chain operations (e.g., Dynasty’s 80 million transactions).  
- **Scalability challenges**: High transaction volumes require optimization (e.g., Paymaster’s role in sponsoring transactions to avoid fee spikes).  
- **Smart contract design**: Emphasis on innovation through experimentation, avoiding rigid adherence to prior solutions.  
- **Liquidity strategies**: Growing user base and real-world assets (e.g., NFTs, tokens) to drive adoption.  

### Related Topics  
- **Community-driven development**: Base Camp’s role in fostering collaboration and innovation.  
- **Technical scalability**: Balancing low fees with high transaction volumes (e.g., Paymaster’s impact on user experience).  
- **Smart contract best practices**: Lessons from Dynasty’s success, emphasizing risk-taking and iterative improvements.  
- **Historical context**: Base’s 2018 launch and evolution into a leading blockchain platform.

built specifically for Base with onchain logic. Last year, Dynasty brought 1.8 million unique wallets to Base, showing that players are ready for deeper blockchain integrationswhen done right."

h3: "Take risks. Push the limits when designing smart contractsdon't just follow what's been done before. The best innovations come from experimenting."

h3: What's the best part of building on Base?

h3: "Low fees, strong liquidity, and a growing user base that actually engages with what you're doing. It's a solid base to build on, no pun intended. What really stands out, though, is the community and support. The Base team has been super helpful, and events like Base Camp were a great chance for builders to meet up, swap ideas, and just get things done. It's that kind of hands-on support that makes a big difference."

h3: What do you want to tell builders who are thinking about Base? Why would you convince them to join Base?

h3: "We've been building onchain since 2018, deploying hundreds of smart contracts across almost every major chain. Base stands outnot just for the tech, but for how they support builders at scale. They've gone above and beyond to help us onboard users, build new solutions, and tap into real liquidity."

h3: What challenges have you experienced?

h3: "Even with Base's low gas fees, we really pushed the limits last year with Dynasty hitting 1.8 million wallets and over 80 million onchain transactions. Since we wanted to sponsor most transactions for early users (shoutout to Paymaster), even those low fees became unsustainable at scale, which added friction for new players. The solution? More on this coming soon."

h3: What advice do you have to other builders?

h3: "Take risks. Push the limits when designing smart contractsdon't just follow what's been done before. The best innovations come from experimenting. Don't raise funds too early. Too much money too soon can be just as bad as not enough.
