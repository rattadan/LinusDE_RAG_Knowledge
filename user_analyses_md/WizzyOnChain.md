Putting these tweets in bigger context of intentions:
The account seems to be building a persona around being heavily invested in meme coins (99% net worth), which positions them as a crypto enthusiast. The tweet about "ACTIVE" suggests they're emphasizing their ongoing participation in the crypto space, and the question about how many replies they get indicates they're measuring their engagement and possibly trying to build their influence. These tweets collectively suggest that the author is positioning themselves as a crypto investor who wants to demonstrate both their financial commitment to the space and their ability to engage an audience, potentially to become an influencer in the crypto community.
