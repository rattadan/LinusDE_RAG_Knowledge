**Original Text:**

This collective belief and action can actually drive the price higher, making their prediction come true. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy in action. To make the most of this, you need to choose the right indicators. Picking the ones that suit your strategy can significantly improve your chances of success. The 5 most used technical indicators
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is a widely popular indicator in trading because it combines both trend and momentum analysis. It's essential to understand how it works to make informed trading decisions. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) indicator is calculated using two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), one with a 26-candle period and another with a 12-candle period. The MACD line is derived by subtracting the 26-candle EMA from the 12-candle EMA. Additionally, there's a signal line, which is a 9-candle EMA of the MACD line.
