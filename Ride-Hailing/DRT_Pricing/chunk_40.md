## Chunk 40

**Original Text:**

In this simulation
setup, buses and tramways do not interact with DRT vehicles, private cars or bicycles. The walk, bicycle and ride
mode are simulated in a simplified way, i.e. teleported from one activity to the next one. That is, transport users do
not interact with each other or users of other modes. For walk and bicycle, the travel times are computed based on
a mode-specific speed (walk: 4 km/h; bicycle: 12 km/h) and a trip distance resulting from the beeline distance and a
beeline distance factor (walk: 1.5; bicycle: 1.4).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

So, it sounds like you're simulating a transportation system that allows users to travel by various modes, such as buses, tramways, or even walking and biking. The mode-specific speeds for each of these modes are provided.

It appears that the simulation does not include interactions between different modes, such as buses and trams (DRT vehicles) interacting with other types of transportation. Instead, users are teleported directly from one activity to another, allowing you to move seamlessly between different modes.

The travel times in this simulation are calculated based on two factors: the mode-specific speed and a beeline distance factor. For walk and bike modes, these factors seem to adjust the travel time accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of what I've gathered so far:

- Mode-specific speeds for buses, trams (DRT vehicles), walking, and biking.
- Beeline distance factors that affect travel times in each mode.
- Teleportation between activities allows users to move directly from one activity to another without interacting with other modes.

Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or ask about this simulation!
