   - **Emotional Patterns:** Excitement about potential BTC ATH, impatience with market stagnation, self-deprecating humor

**Context:** Tweets position DEG_2020 as a hybrid crypto analyst/content creator, blending technical expertise with community-driven engagement (airdrops, AMAs). The account builds authority through consistent market commentary while subtly promoting $SOSO and affiliated projects.
