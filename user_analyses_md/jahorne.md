| messages | I've ridden CaBi Bikeshare in DC more recently than I ever have and I have to say it makes me wish Baltimore had a proper Bikeshare again. The Lime and Spin bikes are fine but pale in comparison to the system in DC in user experience, infrastructure and subsidy for affordability. https://t.co/2zWAW2q2ol |
