**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're interested in the GM and Lyft partnership for a robot taxi service. Here's a summary of the article from IEEE Spectrum:

The collaboration between General Motors (GM) and Lyft aims to develop an autonomous taxi system that can safely transport passengers. The project, code-named "cars-that-think," involves integrating Lyft's driverless technology with GM's automotive expertise.

As part of this partnership, Lyft will provide the necessary infrastructure for a fleet of self-driving cars to operate on designated routes in select cities, while GM will contribute its experience and resources to develop the autonomous driving system. The goal is to create a reliable and safe platform for passengers to hail an autonomous vehicle.

The project has already been tested in some locations, including Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. While it's too early to estimate the full potential of this collaboration, it's clear that GM and Lyft are pushing the boundaries of transportation technology.

This partnership also highlights the intersection of automotive innovation, mobility services, and autonomous systems. As the demand for on-demand transportation continues to grow, companies like GM and Lyft are working together to address the challenges and opportunities presented by self-driving cars.
