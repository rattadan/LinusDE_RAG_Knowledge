## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary of the provided text, focusing on key points and decisions. The text consists of multiple tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the main information. The most recent tweets are at the top because the timestamps are in reverse chronological order. Each tweet has a date of August 16, 2021, but different times, starting from 01:01:13 down to 00:49:08. So the order in the input is from latest to earliest, but when summarizing, maybe the order isn't crucial unless there's a timeline involved.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first one mentions a weekly update from Mission Control, tagging Terra Money and Mars Protocol. Not sure what the update is about, but since it's a weekly update, maybe it's routine. The key here is the collaboration or mention of these projects.

2. Next, a tweet about learning with CertiK. CertiK is a security firm, so maybe an educational partnership or event.

3. Then, there's a deadline for converting SENT to DVPN by September 1st. If not converted, tokens are locked forever. This is a critical date and action item for users.

4. Another tweet about Exodus from Ethereum to Cosmos, promoting Sentinel. So a migration campaign, important for user action.

5. A tweet about Kava's L(EARN) program. Kava is a DeFi platform, so this might be a new feature or partnership.

6. A tokensale announcement for CitadelDAO on August 19th. Important date and project to note.

7. Congrats to pSTAKE for hitting $1M TVL. TVL is a key metric in DeFi, showing growth.

8. Akash Network has 15k deployments since March 2021 mainnet. Milestone achievement.

9. Sentinel's Hub produced 2M+ blocks since mainnet. Another milestone.

10. Juno Network's developments, asking what's being built. Maybe highlighting their ecosystem growth.

11. Agoric's Pillar Talk returning. Event or ongoing series.

12. Happy 75th Independence Day to India, mentioning the strong Indian community. Cultural or community recognition.

13. 1500+ validators interested in Ethermint

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand the structure of the text. It looks like a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, each with a timestamp, mentions, and some content.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. I need to go through each one and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, looking at the structure of the tweets. They all seem to be announcements or congratulations. The account is probably promoting various projects within the Cosmos ecosystem. Let's start with the first tweet. It mentions a weekly update from Mission Control and tags Terra Money and Mars Protocol. Weekly updates are usually neutral, but since they're sharing progress or news, it might be positive. But the tweet itself is just a link to a weekly update, so maybe neutral unless the content is positive. But without the actual update, just the mention might be neutral.

Next tweet: "Learn with CertiK!" and tags CertiK. This sounds like a positive endorsement, encouraging others to learn with them. Positive.

Third tweet: Deadline for converting tokens to DVPN, warning that SENT will be locked. The deadline is a neutral fact, but the mention of "locked forever" could be negative. However, the overall message is about Exodus from Ethereum to Cosmos, which is framed as a positive move. So maybe mixed, but the main sentiment here is negative because it's a warning with potential consequences.

Fourth tweet: "L(EARN) with Kava!" which is clearly promoting earning opportunities, so positive.

Fifth tweet: Announcing a token sale on CitadelDAO. Token sales are usually positive for projects, so positive.

Sixth tweet: Congratulating pSTAKE on exceeding $1M TVL. Definitely positive with emojis and celebration.

Seventh: Congrats to Akash Network on deployments. Positive again with celebration.

Eighth: Congrats Sentinel on 2M blocks. Positive with emojis.

Ninth: Asking what's being built on Juno. Neutral, as it's a question seeking information.

Tenth: Agoric's Pillar Talk is back. Positive, as it's announcing an event.

Eleventh: Happy 75th Independence Day to India, mentioning their strong community. Positive, celebrating a community.

Twelfth: 1500+ validators interested in Ethermint testnet. Positive, showing growth interest.

Thirteenth: 2 days to Gravity DEX. Excitement about an upcoming event, so positive.

Fourteenth: Welcome BitCannaGlobal to the ecosystem. Positive with "friends" indicating

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text consists of several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first tweet mentions a weekly update from Mission Control with Terra Money and Mars Protocol. But there's no specific action item here, just a mention of collaboration. Maybe not an action item.

Next tweet is about learning with CertiK. Again, seems like a promotional message without a specific task or decision. Probably not an action item either.

Third tweet: The deadline is September 1st. SENT not converted to DVPN will be locked forever. Exodus from Ethereum to Cosmos. This has a clear deadline and action required‚Äîconvert tokens by September 1st. That's a definite action item.

Fourth tweet: L(EARN) with Kava. Promoting Kava, but no specific next steps mentioned. Maybe not.

Fifth tweet: CitadelDAO's token sale on August 19th. The link is provided. The action here is participating in the token sale, so that's a next step with a date.

Then there's a congratulations to pSTAKE for reaching $1M TVL. Just a celebration, no action needed.

Another congrats to Akash Network for 15k deployments. No action here either.

Sentinel's 2M blocks since mainnet. Again, celebration, not an action item.

Next, asking what's being built on Juno. It's a question, not an action.

Agoric's Pillar Talk is back. Maybe an event, but no specific action mentioned.

Happy 75th Independence Day to India. Just a greeting.

1500+ validators interested in Ethermint testnet. Shows interest but no direct action item.

Two days to Gravity DEX! With Emmeris. So the date here is August 17th (since the tweet is from 16th and says two days). Launching Gravity DEX, so that's a next step.

Another tweet mentions Gravity DEX on August 17th again. So confirming the date.

Putting it all together, the key action items are the deadline for converting SENT to DVPN by September 1st, the CitadelDAO token sale on August 19th, and the Gravity DEX launch on August 17th. Also, the Ethermint
