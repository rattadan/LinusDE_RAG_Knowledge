Bitcoin (BTC), the first-ever cryptocurrency, transformed from a digital novelty worth less than a penny to a globally recognized currency trading for almost$70,000 per coinwithin a decade. Even diehard cryptocurrency enthusiasts have difficulty believing digital assets have come so far in such a short time. Although much of the history of cryptocurrency's timeline is still unknown, contemporary economists canât ignore these coins andtokens.Â

The history of cryptocurrency is nowhere near as long as the history of traditional finance, but it has been a wild story thus far. Reviewing cryptocurrencyâs early days gives traders a greater perspective on this emerging asset class.Â

Bitcoin's launch in 2009 was the culmination of dozens of failed cryptocurrency projects from the â80s to the early 2000s. Throughout these years, many independent developers and cryptographers experimented with digital currency payment systems, with some influencing BTCâs eventual design.Â
