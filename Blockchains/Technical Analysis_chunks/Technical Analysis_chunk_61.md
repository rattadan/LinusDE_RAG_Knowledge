**Original Text:**

They offer robust MACD functionality, real-time data, and the option to tweak indicator settings. Configuring MACD on Your Chart 

Configuring the MACD is straightforward. First, I add it via the indicators tab on my chosen platform. It then displays the MACD line, signal line, and histogram. The default 12, 26, 9 settings are set automatically and provide a reliable baseline for reading crypto trends. Customising MACD Settings for Different Strategies 

Customising MACD settings amplifies trading strategies. I adjust the timeframes based on volatility or objectives. For short-term trades, I use 6, 13, and 5. For long-term trends, I prefer 19, 39, and 9. Experimenting with these settings helped me align the MACD to my trading needs effectively. Interpreting MACD Signals 

Identifying Bullish and Bearish Crossovers 

Bullish and bearish crossovers provide critical trading insights. A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD line rises above the signal line. Itâ€™s a potential buy signal.
