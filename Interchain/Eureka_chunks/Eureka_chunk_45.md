## Eureka - Chunk 45

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Execute the Route using SkipClient
Finally, you can use SkipClient.executeRoute to prompt the user to sign the approval(s) and transaction, and submit the transaction on chain. TypeScript

Copy
await skipClient.executeRoute({
  route:route,
  userAddresses: userAddresses
});


Cross-chain Failure Cases
This page covers the different ways our cross-chain swaps + transfers might fail to help identify failures and manage user expectations

â€‹
Failures during IBC Transfers and Swaps
There are two types of IBC failures that may occur when a user attempts to traverse a swap / transfer route produced by the Skip Go API. Pre-Swap / swap failures
What: These are failures in the sequence of ICS-20 transfers leading up to the swap or a failure in the swap itself (usually due to slippage).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining specific technical details, parameters, and processes related to cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a focused analysis:

1. **Technical Details:**
	* The chunk discusses potential failure points for Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) transfers, including:
		+ Potential timeouts or slippage.
		+ Tokens being sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
	* It also mentions similar rules for Post-Swap Failures in Axelar GMP and Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP).
2. **Connection to surrounding context:**
	* The chunk connects to the broader topic of cross-chain asset transfers, providing an overview of various protocols and their potential failure points.
3. **Requirements and conditions:**
	* None mentioned explicitly.

This section is explaining how IBC fails can occur, what these failures mean (Pre-Swap/Swap Failures), and how they impact users. It also provides a brief overview of the related protocols and their specific handling of failed transfers.

To build upon this context:

* Developers would need to consider implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.
* Users should be informed about potential failure points through user education and risk management practices.
* To mitigate risks, developers could implement robust incentives for relayers and encourage users to monitor transactions.
