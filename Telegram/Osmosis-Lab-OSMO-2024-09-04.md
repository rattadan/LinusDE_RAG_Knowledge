## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I'll go through the text to identify the main topics discussed.

The conversation starts with questions about earning swap fees on Osmosis. USDCJesus asks if fees can be earned in various tokens like Kujira and TC, and mikebarb mentions that fees depend on the pool or route. Then there's a discussion about the swap fee being 0.5% on Osmosis. 

Next, there's a thread about the block explorer links. Svansy is frustrated that Osmosis uses MintScan instead of Chainscope, which he considers the better explorer. GPKwee defends the current setup, saying it's convenient because MintScan supports more chains, and users can manually copy-paste to Chainscope. They argue about the user experience and whether the project is hostile to feedback.

Another part involves moonz_9 sharing a Discord link for Margined Protocol and oldi6 asking about a Telegram group. Then there's some banter about shilling and community behavior, with profesija joking about being seen as an ambassador. 

Later, meme_librarian asks about the legitimacy of "uwupica" on Osmosis, and kychuli advises caution with larger amounts due to small pool sizes. Also, user_7164487109 mentions encountering a fake Telegram group for COSMO and getting scammed, leading to a discussion about privacy settings to avoid scammers.

There's a mention of Osmosis vaults by oldi6 and some off-topic comments about Cosmos and ATOM. The statbot repeats support links and privacy advice.

Key points to highlight: the swap fee structure, the explorer link debate between MintScan and Chainscope, the fake COSMO token and scam group, liquidity pool concerns for certain tokens, and the privacy settings advice. Also, the ongoing community tensions regarding feedback and project responsiveness.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, so I'll structure it around these key issues without getting into every back-and-forth. Focus on decisions made or implications, like the fee structure depending on pools, the choice to keep MintScan links, the mention of small liquidity pools, and the scam warnings. Avoid including every instance of frustration but note the hostility comment and the project's perceived lack of listening to feedback.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or specific subjects being discussed.

Looking at the messages, there's a lot of discussion about Osmosis, a blockchain platform. Users mention things like swap fees, block explorers (Mintscan vs. Chainscope), staking, liquidity pools, and specific tokens like USDC, ATOM, and COSMO. There's also talk about joining Telegram groups, scams, and some project feedback. 

I should note terms like "swap fees" since multiple people are asking about them. The debate between using Mintscan or Chainscope as explorers comes up several times. Staking and liquidity are mentioned in different contexts, like earning fees or issues with pool sizes. Tokens such as COSMO and projects like Margined Protocol and Pica are discussed, especially regarding listings and legitimacy. 

Scams and privacy settings are addressed by the bot, so that's another topic. The mention of Telegram groups and Discord servers relates to community engagement and potential security issues. Also, there's a reference to merging with ATOM, which might be a project development or a point of contention.

I need to ensure that each topic is distinct but covers all aspects. Maybe combine related terms like "block explorers" to include both Mintscan and Chainscope. Also, check for any other repeated issues, like user complaints about the project's responsiveness or bugs. Terms like "vaults" from one of the messages might be part of a broader topic like "new features" or "platform updates."

Wait, there's also a mention of "OTC" and "UWUPICA," which are specific to trading methods or tokens. Should those be included? Since they're specific to the conversation, yes, but maybe under broader categories like "token trading" or "specific tokens."

Putting it all together, the main topics would be: swap fees, block explorers (Mintscan vs. Chainscope), staking, liquidity pools, USDC, ATOM, COSMO token, Margined Protocol, Pica bridge, OTC trading, UWUPICA token, Telegram groups, Discord server, privacy settings, scams, token listings, project feedback, and merging with ATOM.

I need to make sure these are all relevant and not too granular. Some

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from what looks like a Telegram group related to Osmosis. I need to go through each message and determine the overall sentiment.

Starting with the earliest messages. The user_7164487109 mentions staying in a scam group for a long time. They also talk about joining a group where the admin didn't know about a token called COSMO, implying they were scammed. That's definitely negative. Then there's the osmosis_statbot giving support links and security tips, which is neutral or positive, but since it's a bot, maybe neutral.

GPKwee's messages: They mention not needing to list all the new tokens because there are so many "shit coins". That's a negative term. Also, advising others to leave if they don't think it's official, which could be negative or just a warning. 

Svansy is quite critical. Phrases like "total trash response", "dump my osmos shitcoins", "project never listening", "everything bad" are strong negatives. They're frustrated with the platform's issues and lack of responsiveness to feedback.

Other users like kychuli and meme_librarian discuss liquidity and tokens. Kychuli says a token has $150 liquidity, which is a bit dismissive but not overly negative. Meme_librarian is asking about Pica and OTC, seems neutral or slightly positive as they're considering options.

There's a back-and-forth about using Chainscope vs. Mintscan. Svansy prefers Chainscope and criticizes Mintscan as barely an explorer. GPKwee defends Mintscan's multi-chain support. This part is a mix of negative and neutral, but Svansy's comments are more negative.

Discussions about swap fees and staking are more informational, neutral. The "Classic Linda" and "hah never boring" from BasementNodes and profesija might be inside jokes or neutral remarks.

The statbot and some other messages are neutral. The user asking about Telegram groups for Margined Protocol is neutral inquiry. 

Overall, the majority of the user comments are negative, especially Svansy's multiple complaints about the project's handling of feedback, calling things "shitcoins" and "pathetic". GPKwee's use of "shit coins" also adds to negative sentiment. The neutral parts are the

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I'll read through the messages to understand the context. It looks like a conversation on Discord or Telegram related to Osmosis, a blockchain platform, discussing things like swap fees, block explorers, liquidity pools, and some user complaints.

The user wants me to identify any specific tasks or decisions made. Let me go through each message and see if any actionable items are mentioned. 

Starting from the top:

- Mikebarb asks about being an LP in a specific pool. Maybe someone needs to check pool details?
- USDCJesus asks if they're a staker. Not sure if that's an action item.
- BasementNodes says "should anyway" and talks about earning swap fees. Maybe a decision to earn fees in certain tokens?
- USDCJesus asks about earning fees in various tokens like Kujira and TC. So maybe a next step is to investigate or implement that.
- Mikebarb mentions fees vary by pool/route. Not an action item.
- USDCJesus asks about the swap fee on Osmosis. Maybe someone needs to check or confirm that.
- There's a discussion about block explorers: Svansy complains about Osmosis linking to Mintscan instead of Chainscope. GPKwee suggests copying and pasting to Chainscope. So possible action items here could be to switch the default explorer or improve the links.
- Meme_librarian asks if Pica is legit and if Uwupica on Osmo equals Uwu. Kychuli responds about liquidity on Pica. So maybe a decision to use Pica for certain tokens.
- User_7164487109 talks about a fake Telegram group and admin not knowing about COSMO token. Osmosis_statbot gives steps to block scammers. So action items here could be security measures or reporting scams.
- GPKwee mentions privacy settings to avoid scammers. Another action item related to user security.
- Oldi6 started playing with new vaults yesterday. Maybe next steps involve further testing or using the vaults.
- Moonz_9 provides a Discord link for Margined Protocol and mentions they don't have a Telegram. So possible action to join the Discord server.
- Svansy is frustrated with the project not listening to feedback. Not an action item but
