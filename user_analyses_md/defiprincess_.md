The tweets mention things like "TA levels," "trencher," "A/B testing," and "experimentation." So the main themes are probably cryptocurrency, DeFi, and some project-related activities.

Next, the language style and tone. The user uses phrases like "If every coin starts respecting TA levels" which sounds a bit casual, maybe even slang.
