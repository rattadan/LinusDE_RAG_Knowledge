I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

Let us consider the simplest case with one
request at the border of the service area and just one parking lot in
proximity. The overlapping proportion might be, e.g., 20%. For the lot
zone, this request would count as an additional demand of 0.2 because
it is assumed that the vehicles from other lot zones could serve this
request as well. But for this to be true, it would be necessary that the
whole area of this request range is part of at least one parking lot
zone. If this is not the case, the demand value of this request has to be
increased so that it reaches 1. Considering our example with just one
parking lot in proximity: Even though the overlap is only 20%, vehicles
from this zone are the only ones able to serve this request. Therefore,
it has to be counted as one full request with demand value 1. In case of
more than one lot zone overlapping with a request range, the overlaps
are scaled linearly. Putting everything together.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided text chunk, here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The context involves dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.
* The system is described as having one parking lot in proximity to a request at the border of the service area.
* The overlap between the request range and the parking lot zone can be up to 20%.
* The demand value of a single request is determined by scaling it linearly based on the overlap.

**Contextual Connection:**

* This chunk is building upon the surrounding context, which discusses simulation and modeling methodologies for ride-hailing systems.
* The specific reference to "one parking lot in proximity" suggests that this example is part of a broader analysis or exploration of dynamic dispatch techniques.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

* The system must have overlapping demand zones within a certain percentage (20% in this case).
* The demand value of a single request should be determined based on the overlap between the request range and parking lot zone.
* If no overlap occurs, the demand value may need to be increased for the request to be considered valid.

Overall, this chunk is providing technical details and context for how dynamic dispatch works in ride-hailing systems, specifically with regard to managing overlapping demand zones.
