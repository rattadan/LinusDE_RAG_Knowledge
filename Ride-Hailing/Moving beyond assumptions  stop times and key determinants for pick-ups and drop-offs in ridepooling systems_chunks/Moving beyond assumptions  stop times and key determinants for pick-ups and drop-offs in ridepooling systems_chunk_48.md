**Original Text:**

Naturally, the
inclusion of additional data and a larger sample size would further enhance the robustness
of the model and increase statistical certainty. Regarding the on-site observations, it should be considered that, the time measurements for PUDO events were conducted manually, relying on the observer’s subjective
judgement to determine the precise start and end of each stop. However, since the same
person performed all on-site observations, the subjective bias is consistent. In addition, we
cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the presence of the observer in the vehicle may
have influenced the behaviour of passengers or drivers. However, the observer made a concerted effort to remain as passive as possible, sitting in a place in the vehicle that did not
obstruct passengers during the boarding or alighting process. Lastly, the estimation of passengers’ age was solely based on their physical appearance, potentially leading to some
inaccuracies in the assignment for the age categorisation.
