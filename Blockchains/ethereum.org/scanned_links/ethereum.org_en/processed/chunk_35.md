# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_35.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
This content explains Ethereum's technical architecture, focusing on consensus mechanisms (proof-of-stake), validator roles, slot-based data structures, and block explorers, while detailing how data is stored and accessed across the network.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Smart Contract Accounts**: Accounts with full data like balances, code, and transaction history, often visible in block explorers.  
- **Validators**: Stakeholders responsible for proposing blocks and attesting to them, with randomized committees to ensure fairness.  
- **Epochs & Slots**: Time-based divisions (6.4 minutes) for block creation, with slots containing data about transactions and attestations.  
- **Attestations**: "Yes" votes to include blocks in the chain, tracking validator activity and block validity.  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Consensus mechanism where validators stake funds to propose and attest to blocks.  
- **Block Explorers**: Tools (e.g., Etherscan, Blockchair) that display blockchain data, including token details, validator activity, and transaction history.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Validator Committees**: Randomized committees of validators are formed at the end of each epoch to prevent collusion.  
- **Epoch Data**: Includes slot-specific data (e.g., transaction records, attestation votes) and epoch-level metrics (e.g., block counts, validator staking).  
- **Slots**: Block creation opportunities where data (e.g., transactions, attestations) is stored, with slots tied to epochs.  
- **Attestation Data**: Includes the block hash, proposer, and validator signatures, ensuring transparency and accountability.  
- **Block Explorers**: Features like token balances, transaction logs, and validator activity are accessible via tools like Etherscan, Blockchair, and Ethplorer.  

### Related Topics  
- **Consensus Layer**: The content connects to Ethereum's consensus mechanisms (PoS), validator roles, and slot-based data structures.  
- **Block Explorer Resources**: The list of block explorers (e.g., Etherscan, Blockchair) ties to the "community resource" section, emphasizing cross-platform tools for blockchain data visualization.  
- **Token Data**: The discussion of tokens (e.g., ERC-20) aligns with Ethereum's smart contract architecture and data visibility constraints.

to use multiple accounts so that your assets and value can't be easily tracked. There are also some solutions being developed to make transactions and account activity more private. But here's the data that's available for accounts:

Smart contract accounts have all the data that a user account will have, but some block explorers will even display some code information too. Examples include:

Tokens are a type of contract so they'll have similar data to a smart contract. But because they have value and can be traded they have additional data points:

Some block data is concerned about the health of Ethereum more holistically.

For security reasons, randomized committees of validators are created at the end of every epoch (every 6.4 minutes). Epoch data includes:

Slots are opportunities for block creation, the data available for each slot includes:

Proof-of-stake divides time into slots and epochs. So that means new data!

Validators are responsible for proposing blocks and attesting to them within slots.

Attestations are "yes" votes to include blocks in the chain. Their data relates to a record of the attestation and the validators who attested

The consensus layer top-level data includes the following:
