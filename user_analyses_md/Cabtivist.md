Contextualizing this tweet:
This tweet appears to be from a New York City taxi driver ("Hack" is slang for taxi driver in NYC) who is politically active ("Cabtivist" suggests activism related to cab drivers). He's comparing his Hack license to a SAG-AFTRA card (used by actors) to highlight the professional licensing requirements and perhaps the lack of recognition or benefits his profession receives compared to unionized entertainment professionals. By asking about another Hack named Robert, he shows connection to his community. The mention of a radio appearance suggests he's using media platforms to raise awareness about taxi driver issues.
