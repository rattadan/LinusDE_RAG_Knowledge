# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_25.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.dydx.xyz/*

### Document Overview  
The document compares Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting their differences in purpose, consensus mechanisms, and environmental impact, while introducing Ethereum's upcoming network upgrades (Purge and Splurge) and their implications for scalability and sustainability.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), while Ethereum transitions to Proof of Stake (PoS) in its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.  
- **Environmental Impact**: Bitcoin’s PoW is energy-intensive, whereas Ethereum’s PoS is more energy-efficient.  
- **Network Upgrades**: Ethereum’s *Purge* (data pruning) and *Splurge* (blockchain expansion) aim to improve scalability (100,000 TPS target).  
- **Decentralization**: Ethereum emphasizes scalability and flexibility, while Bitcoin prioritizes security and decentralization.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Ethereum 2.0 TPS Target**: Ethereum 2.0 aims to process over 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) through upgrades like the *Purge* and *Splurge*.  
- **Consensus Mechanism Details**: Bitcoin’s PoW requires mining hardware and consumes significant energy, while Ethereum’s PoS reduces energy consumption and transaction fees.  
- **Network Scalability**: Ethereum’s *Purge* involves removing outdated data to free up storage, while *Splurge* expands the blockchain to accommodate more transactions.  

### Related Topics  
- **Ethereum Upgrades**: The document connects to the *Purge* and *Splurge* events, which are part of Ethereum’s roadmap for scalability.  
- **Cryptocurrency Comparison**: The analysis ties to broader discussions on Bitcoin vs. Ethereum, linking to dYdX’s guide on selecting cryptocurrencies.  
- **Technical Terms**: The document references terms like *Proof of Work*, *Proof of Stake*, and *Transaction Per Second* (TPS), which are relevant to blockchain technology.

decentralization.
- The Purge:During The Purge, Ethereumâs core developers plan to wipe out old and unnecessary data to free up more storage space. At this stage, Ethereum 2.0 may hit its target of processing more than 100,000 transactions per second (TPS).
- The Splurge:Although itâs unclear what will happen during The Splurge, Buterin ensures crypto fans thatitâll be a lot of âfun.â

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are leaders in the cryptocurrency market. These digital coins consistently rank as the largest and most influential projects in the blockchain sector. For this reason, few cryptocurrency investors deny the competitive advantages BTC and ETH share, but there remains a heated debate over which asset is âbetter.âÂ

Although BTC and ETH have similarities, they arenât in direct competition. Learn more about Bitcoin versus Ethereum and gain a greater appreciation for the diversity of crypto projects.

From their beginnings, Bitcoin and Ethereum had different goals for blockchain technology. Itâs essential for new investors to review each cryptocurrencyâs history and learn the context behind their unique features.Â

Bitcoin is the oldest and most successful cryptocurrency in terms of market cap.
