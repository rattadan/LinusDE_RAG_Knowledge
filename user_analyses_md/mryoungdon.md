Putting these tweets into the bigger context of his intentions:
The author is clearly promoting various crypto/web3 projects (Newton, Union Build, Ton ecosystem), suggesting they are actively involved in the crypto space and possibly earn from promoting or participating in these projects. They're encouraging followers to engage with these platforms using strategies like DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging). The mention of Newton having "our backs" suggests they position themselves as someone who supports and stands by their chosen projects. The reference to EVM developers expanding into the Ton ecosystem indicates they see cross-chain opportunities as valuable and want to bring attention to these integration possibilities. The use of "I'll keep yapping" shows they don't mind being repetitive in their promotion if it helps spread the word about what they believe are valuable projects.

- Uses motivational rhetoric ("watch yourself thrive," "change my life for good").  
- Minimal technical detail; prioritizes emotional appeal over analytical depth.  

3. **Evaluation of legitimacy**  
- Content aligns with crypto marketing norms but lacks concrete evidence for bold claims (e.g., "1 billion users").  
- Promotes specific projects without disclosing affiliations or risks, suggesting potential bias.  
- No overt scams detected, but the tone leans credulous and aspirational.

**Contextualizing intentions**:  
The author acts as a crypto evangelist, leveraging social proof (massive Telegram user numbers) and urgency to rally followers. Their commitment to "stick with DCA" and "Agent Automation" post-TGE frames them as a long-term investor, but the lack of skepticism implies they may prioritize short-term hype over due diligence. The "0______0" typographic face emoji underscores shock or awe, reinforcing their emotional investment in these projects' success.
