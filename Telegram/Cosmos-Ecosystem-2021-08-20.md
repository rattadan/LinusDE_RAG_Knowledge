## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. Let me start by looking through each entry.

First, there's a POSTHUMAN Validator voting YES for proposal #26. Collaboration is mentioned as good, so maybe that's a positive note towards the proposal. Then several tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. 

The first tweet mentions Injective community wanting an ambassador program. Then Gravity Bridge is coming, which is a project update. Some infographics shared, maybe about Cosmos? 

Another tweet about Season 2, episode 8 of 'Conversations with Jack' with participants from Sentinel, Starname, Osmosis. Then a tweet for Russian speakers comparing Polkadot and Cosmos. 

There's a collaboration between Sentinel and Starname, and Osmosis needing votes. Then a Fetch.ai CEO speaking at Token2049 conference in London on Oct 7-8. 

ATOM/XPRT pool on Emeris reaches $2M TVL. Juno mainnet launching Oct 1st. Emeris beta hits $10M TVL in 24 hours. Rust devs wanted by Juno. 

Then a video explaining when airdrop happens. Introduction to Starport and how easy it is to make a blockchain. Daily Cosmos Outpost recap. Video on mining PKT on decentralized cloud.

The last part is from svAbhishek promoting the Conversations with Jack episode with Chalabi from Chandra Station, live at 3pm UTC on Aug 20, links provided. Also mentions joining Telegram groups and following social media.

Key points: Validator support for proposal #26. Gravity Bridge update. New podcast episodes (Conversations with Jack). Collaborations between projects (Sentinel-Starname, others). Emeris beta success with high TVL. Juno mainnet date set. Ambassador program for Injective. Job for Rust devs at Juno. Airdrop info video. Starport tutorials. PKT mining video. Fetch.ai CEO's conference talk. Community engagement via Telegram and social media.

Decisions: Osmosis seeking votes. Proposal #26 approved by POSTHUMAN. Juno's mainnet launch date. Injective formalizing ambassador program.

I should structure the summary around these updates, collaborations, decisions, and community activities. Make sure to mention the main projects involved and the key announcements. Keep it concise, bullet points might work best. Avoid redundant

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand what the text contains. Looking at it, there are several entries from different users, mostly combot and svAbhishek, sharing tweets and updates related to the Cosmos ecosystem.

Starting with the first entry: "POSTHUMAN Validator vote YES for proposal #26" ‚Äì the main topic here seems to be the validator voting yes on a specific proposal. So "Validator vote YES for proposal #26" is a topic. Then it mentions "Collaboration is good!" which is a general statement, but since it's in the context of the Cosmos ecosystem, maybe "Collaboration" is a separate topic.

Next, combot's tweets. The first one is about Injective community wanting an ambassador program. So "Injective ambassador program" would be a topic. Then Gravity Bridge is mentioned, so "Gravity Bridge" is another. The third tweet has "infographics" and mentions Cosmos and Cosmos Ecosystem, but maybe the infographics are about those topics, so "infographics" could be a topic. 

Then there's a tweet about Season 2, ep. 8 of 'Conversations with Jack' featuring Chandra Station and OmniFlix Network. The main topic here is the podcast episode, but the user might want the key elements like "Conversations with Jack episode 8" or "Chandra Station collaboration". However, since the user wants main topics, perhaps just the episode title and the main subject. Wait, the tweet mentions that the episode is about how the Chandra Station team got together, explored Cosmos, etc. So maybe "Chandra Station collaboration" or "Conversations with Jack episode 8" is a topic.

Another tweet is about a comparison between Polkadot and Cosmos for Russian speakers. So "Polkadot VS Cosmos comparison" could be a main topic. Then Sentinel and Starname collaboration, and Osmosis needing votes. So "Sentinel and Starname collaboration" and "Osmosis vote" are topics.

The Fetch.ai CEO speaking at Token2049 conference in London ‚Äì "Fetch.ai CEO speaking at Token2049 conference" is a topic. The ATOM/XPRT pool on Emeris with $2M+ TVL ‚Äì "ATOM/XPRT pool TVL" or "Emer

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages provided. 

First, the user's message: "POSTHUMAN Validator vote YES for proposal #26. Collaboration is good!" That seems positive. Voting yes usually indicates support, and "collaboration is good" is a clear positive statement.

Then there are several tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. Let's go through each one:

1. Injective community asked for an ambassador program. The tweet mentions it's formalized, which sounds positive. They're responding to community requests, so that's a good thing.
2. Gravity Bridge is coming! Exclamation mark, so excitement here. Positive.
3. Some nice infographics! Praise for visuals, positive.
4. Episode 8 of 'Conversations with Jack' with mentions of participants. Neutral, just announcing an event.
5. Polkadot VS Cosmos for Russian speakers. Neutral since it's a comparison, but the user might be promoting their own, so maybe slightly positive.
6. Sentinel and Starname are friends! Collaboration again, positive. Also, Osmosis needs votes, which is a call to action but neutral in sentiment.
7. CEO speaking at a conference. Excited to share, so positive.
8. $ATOM/$XPRT pool achieved $2M+ TVL. Positive because it's highlighting success.
9. Rust dev opportunity with JunoNetwork. Neutral or slightly positive, encouraging participation.
10. Airdrop info via video. Neutral, informative.
11. Introduction to Starport. Neutral, educational.
12. How easy to make a blockchain on StarportHQ. Neutral, but could be positive if it's promoting ease of use.
13. Daily Outpost mention. Neutral.
14. Video on mining PKT. Neutral, but promoting their service.
15. Emeris beta reached $10M TVL. Positive, showing growth.
16. Juno mainnet launching in October. Positive, announcing progress.
17. Citizen Cosmos and Cryptocio partnership. Neutral, but collaborations are generally positive.

Then svAbhishek's messages about Flix Fam and Conversations with Jack. They use emojis like üî• and phrases like "Spread the word," which are positive. They're promoting an event and encouraging participation.

Overall, most of the tweets are promoting collaborations, successes (like TVL milestones), and

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. The text is a series of tweets and a couple of messages from svAbhishek.

First, I'll go through each entry one by one. The first message is from "unknown" voting YES for proposal #26. That's a decision made, so I should note that. Then there's a tweet about Injective's ambassador program. The community has asked for it, but is there an action item here? Maybe the formalization is a decision, but the tweet itself might not be an action unless they're announcing they're creating it. The user might consider that as a decision.

Next, Gravity Bridge is coming. That's an upcoming event, so a next step for the team, but not sure if it's an action item for others. Then some infographics shared, but no action there. The tweet about Osmosis needing votes is an action item‚Äîurging people to vote. 

The Fetch.ai CEO speaking at Token2049 in London on Oct 7-8 is an event announcement, so a next step for them. The $ATOM/$XPRT pool on Emeris with $2M TVL is a status update, not an action. Juno mainnet launch on October 1st is a decision or next step. 

The rest are about videos to watch, collaborations, and the daily outpost. The svAbhishek messages mention a live YouTube broadcast at 3pm UTC on August 20, asking people to tune in and spread the word. Also, links to Telegram and Twitter for discussions and announcements. So those are action items: attend the live event, join Telegram groups, follow on social media.

I need to make sure I don't miss any. Let me check again. The Osmosis vote, Juno mainnet date, attending the live YouTube session, joining Telegrams, following on Twitter, and the ambassador program. Also, the video about mining PKT and watching the Starport introduction. Wait, but some of these are informational. The user might want only the actionable items. For example, "Osmosis needs your vote" is a direct action. "Tune in live" is another. "Spread the word" is an action item. "Join the discussion on Telegram" is also actionable. 

So compiling all these, I should
