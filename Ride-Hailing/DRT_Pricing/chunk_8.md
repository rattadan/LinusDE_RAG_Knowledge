1. Introduction and Problem Statement
In recent years, the rise of ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft has transformed the way people move around cities (Rapoport, 2019). As these companies have expanded their services to include shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), a shift in passenger behavior has occurred, with many passengers now opting for alternative modes of transportation over traditional public transit.

The proliferation of ride-hailing apps has led to an increase in the number of people living and working in urban areas, resulting in a significant growth in demand for on-demand mobility services. As a result, cities are facing challenges in managing their service areas effectively, including issues related to congestion, air pollution, and pedestrian safety.

This paper will examine the impact of shared autonomous vehicles on ride-hailing services, with a focus on pricing strategies, demand responsive transit, and service area design. We will also explore how agent-based modeling can be used to simulate these effects and provide insights for urban planners and policymakers.

Simulation studies have been used extensively in the field of transportation planning to evaluate the performance of different routes, schedules, and pricing strategies (e.g., Hensbergen et al., 2012). By using simulation techniques, researchers can model the complex interactions between users, infrastructure, and services, providing valuable insights for cities looking to optimize their transportation systems.

To address the challenges posed by shared autonomous vehicles, cities will need to adopt a more data-driven approach to service area design. This may involve integrating real-time traffic information into smart city platforms, enabling better coordination of public transit and ride-hailing services (e.g., Li et al., 2020).

Pricing strategies will also play a critical role in the adoption of shared autonomous vehicles. Studies have shown that dynamic pricing can be an effective way to manage demand and optimize revenue for ride-hailing companies (e.g., Kumar & Shukla, 2017). By using agent-based modeling, researchers can simulate the effects of different pricing strategies on user behavior and service availability.

Furthermore, simulation studies can be used to examine the impact of shared autonomous vehicles on pedestrian safety. As SAVs reduce the need for human-driven transportation, cities may need to consider alternative design elements, such as improved street layouts and increased pedestrian visibility (e.g., Zhang et al., 2020).
