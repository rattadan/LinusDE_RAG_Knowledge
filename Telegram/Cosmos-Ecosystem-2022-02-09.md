## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to summarize the provided text, focusing on key points and decisions. The text consists of several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and a couple of other mentions.

First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the main ideas. The first tweet is about Cosmos partnering with Injective via IBC, which is a significant collaboration. Then another tweet mentions the first decentralized ATOM perpetual futures developed by Injective Labs, which is important for financial opportunities in the ecosystem. 

There's a retweet about Telegram breaking language barriers, similar to Sputnik connecting Web2 and Web3. They provided a link to a translation guide. Another tweet praises JunoNetwork as a bright star in the Cosmos Sky, indicating support for that project. The Cosmos Ecosystem also supports MetaRatsNFT, which is a partnership or endorsement. 

An airdrop announcement is mentioned, which is a key event. Then there's a tweet about supporting a decentralized social initiative within the Osmosis community, specifically calling out someone (ponimajushij) trying to decentralize social power. They mention stopping someone from being an admin and allowing another user (UCDEyIXRMH) to write in groups. 

Additionally, there's a mention of Archie_cosmos promoting a Telegram space and asking for votes/comments on Comdex features. Cryptohelper_01 tells someone to check DMs, which might not be crucial for the summary.

I should group these points, focusing on official announcements and decisions. The key elements are partnerships (Injective, Juno, MetaRatsNFT), financial developments (perpetual futures), the airdrop, decentralized social initiatives, and community engagement efforts. The Telegram translation part is also a highlight for accessibility. 

Need to make sure the summary is concise, avoids retweets unless they're significant, and omits less relevant messages like DM reminders. Also, check for any dates or times, but since the summary should focus on content rather than timestamps, maybe skip those. 

Putting it all together, the main points are collaborations, financial products, airdrop, decentralized social efforts, and support for specific projects. Need to structure them clearly, perhaps in bullet points or a short paragraph. Ensure that each key decision or announcement is mentioned once, even if there are multiple tweets about it. Also, note the community engagement aspects like voting on Comdex features.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. The text consists of several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem and some other accounts.

First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the key topics mentioned. Let me start by breaking down each entry:

1. The first tweet mentions Cosmos and Injective collaborating via IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). So the main topics here are Cosmos, Injective Labs, and IBC Frens. IBC is a protocol in the Cosmos ecosystem for connecting different blockchains, so "IBC Frens" likely refers to that collaboration.

2. The second tweet talks about decentralized $ATOM perpetual futures. ATOM is the native token of Cosmos, and perpetual futures are a type of financial derivative. The mention of Injective Labs here links it to the previous tweet. So topics here would be Decentralized Finance (DeFi), ATOM, and Injective Labs.

3. The third tweet is a retweet about Telegram breaking language barriers, similar to Sputnik connecting Web2 and Web3. So topics here are Telegram, Sputnik Network, Web2, Web3, and language translation.

4. The fourth message from Archie_cosmos mentions a Twitter space and voting/commenting on Comdex. Twitter spaces are audio chat features, and Comdex is another project in the Cosmos ecosystem. So topics here are Twitter Spaces, Comdex, and community engagement.

5. The fifth tweet again discusses Telegram and Sputnik Network, so similar to point 3. Also mentions enabling translations in Telegram, so that's a repeat topic.

6. Cryptohelper_01's message is about checking DMs (direct messages) with a user, which seems less about topics and more of a direct message, so maybe not relevant here.

7. The next tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem mentions JunoNetwork as a bright star in Cosmos Sky. JunoNetwork is another blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem, so topics are Cosmos and JunoNetwork.

8. Then there's support for MetaRatsNFT, which is an NFT project. So topics here are Cosmos Ecosystem and MetaRatsNFT.

9. An airdrop announcement is mentioned, which is a common term in crypto for distributing tokens. So "Airdrop" is a topic.

10. The last tweet supports a decentralized social power initiative

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and some other users. I need to determine the sentiment of each text, whether positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem: "Cosmos ü§ù Injective = IBC Frens". IBC stands for Inter-Blockchain Communication, which is a protocol in the Cosmos network. The term "Frens" is a playful way of saying friends, indicating a positive collaboration. The emojis used like ü§ù and the context of partnership suggest a positive sentiment.

Next, the second tweet mentions "First Decentralized $ATOM Perpetual Futures!" and thanks InjectiveLabs for developing the ecosystem. Words like "first" and "decentralized" are positive in the crypto context. Emojis like üôå and the mention of bringing opportunities to the community also point to positive sentiment.

Third tweet: RT from themselves about Telegram allowing breaking language barriers, similar to Sputnik connecting Web2 and Web3. The use of "very cool" and emojis like ü§ù and üôå shows approval and positivity. Highlighting how-to use translations also seems informative and supportive, so positive.

Then there's a message from Archie_cosmos directing to a Twitter space and asking to vote and comment on Comdex. The link is provided, but the sentiment here is neutral because it's more of a call to action without explicit positive or negative words.

The next tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem again talks about Telegram breaking language barriers. Similar to the previous one, using "very cool" and emojis like üôå and üòé indicates positive sentiment. They're promoting a feature, so it's favorable.

Cryptohelper_01's message is a DM check, which is neutral. It's a direct message request without any emotional language.

Another Cosmos tweet about JunoNetwork being a bright star. "Brightest stars" is a compliment, so positive sentiment here.

Supporting MetaRatsNFT with emojis like üòâ and wishes from SputnikNetwork. This is positive as they're showing support.

"Airdrop is coming..." is typically positive in crypto communities because airdrops are seen as beneficial, distributing free tokens. So positive.

The last tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem supports a decentralized social power move, criticizing the admin role and advocating for others to write in groups. The use of "support" and the context

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps from these tweets. 

First, looking at the tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first one mentions "First Decentralized $ATOM Perpetual Futures!" developed by InjectiveLabs. That seems like a decision or a new initiative they've announced. Then there's a tweet about supporting MetaRatsNFT and SputnikNetwork, which might be a decision to endorse those projects.

Another tweet says "Airdrop is coming..." which is a next step indicating they plan to distribute tokens. There's also a tweet about supporting a decentralized social power move within Osmosiszone Community, calling for someone to stop being an admin and someone else to get writing permissions. That sounds like an action item directed at the community admins.

The user Archie_cosmos mentions a Telegram space link and asks people to vote and comment on what they want to see on comdex. That's a next step for the audience to participate. 

Cryptohelper_01's message is a direct command to check DMs, which is an action item for Abhitejsingh. 

I need to make sure I don't miss any implicit steps. For example, the IBC Frens tweet is a collaboration announcement, which might be a decision. The Telegram translation mention could be a suggestion or a next step for users. 

Wait, the SputnikNetwork and Telegram tweet talks about enabling translations. The Cosmos Ecosystem is highlighting that, so maybe it's just informational, but the action item is for users to check how to use it. Hmm, but the user might need to know if there's an explicit action required. The original tweet might be encouraging others to adopt similar practices, but unless there's a direct "do this" statement, maybe it's just a note.

So compiling all these points: the airdrop announcement, the support for InjectiveLabs and MetaRatsNFT, the decentralized social power initiative, the DM check, and the voting in the Telegram space. I should list each as an action item, decision, or next step with the responsible party and context. Need to present them clearly, maybe bullet points. Also check for any other possible steps I might have missed. The RTs are just retweets, so unless there's a specific action in them, they might not be.
