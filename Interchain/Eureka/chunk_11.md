## Chunk 11

**Original Text:**

The security council is composed of individuals associated with well-respected and trusted entities in the Ethereum and Cosmos communities:

Wildcat Finance
Informal
Hypha
ZK Validator
Chorus One
Coinbase Cloud
Interchain Labs
​
Pausing council
The pausing council is designated for rapid-response to a security incident. The only actions that the pausing council can take are pausing and unpausing transfers out of the Ethereum-side contracts. The council is composed of a subset of people in the Security Council who are going to be rapidly responding to security incidents related to canonical IBC Eureka deployments. The actions of the pausing council are not time-locked to allow for a quick response time. ​
Governance stage (1)
After the protocol has successfully launched, the next step in the IBC Eureka roadmap is to allow general contract message passing between chains.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This appears to be a technical document from the Ethereum and Cosmos communities outlining the roles and responsibilities of various entities within the Interchange Bridge for Ethereum (IBC) ecosystem.

From what it states, here are some key points about the Security Council:

- The Security Council is composed of individuals associated with well-respected and trusted entities in the Ethereum and Cosmos communities.
- There is also a Pausing Council which is designated to respond quickly to security incidents. 
- The only actions that the pausing council can take are pausing and unpausing transfers out of Ethereum-side contracts, but these actions are not time-locked.
- After successful protocol launch, the next step in the IBC Eureka roadmap will be for general contract message passing between chains.

It seems like the Security Council's role is to protect the Interchange Bridge for Ethereum (IBC) and respond quickly to security incidents. The pausing council, on the other hand, focuses on responding rapidly to security incidents by pausing or unpausing transfers out of Ethereum-side contracts.
