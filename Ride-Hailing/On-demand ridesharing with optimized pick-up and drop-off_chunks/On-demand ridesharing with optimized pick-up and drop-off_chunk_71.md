**Original Text:**

We simulate
this situation in the scenario concentrated demand, by moving each origin and destination in the diagonal towards the center of
the base network with a probability of 0.5. Results are shown in Table 2 for the base scenario, the two alternatives just described, and a fourth scenario that merges those two
modifications. All times are in minutes in Table 2. Several conclusions follow:
• Requesting users to walk improves SMoD significantly. Regarding operators, VHT is reduced by more than 10% for every scenario. For users, the number of rejections can be reduced by at least one third (the two last scenarios), and up to almost two thirds (the first
scenario). Average users’ costs diminish in three of the four scenarios. • The reduced rejection rate reveals that diminishing the detours makes more vehicles available to transport the emerging users.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk focuses on a simulation scenario, specifically analyzing the impact of different routing strategies on ridesharing services (Social Mobility on Demand, or SMoD) in urban areas.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

- The simulation involves randomly moving origin and destination points towards the center of a base network with a probability of 0.5.
- There are four scenarios presented:
    - Scenario 1: No modification to route optimization
    - Scenario 2: Modification where diagonal movements increase towards the center (with a probability of 0.5)
    - Scenario 3: Modification that merges the first two scenarios, increasing diagonal movement towards the center by 25% (resulting in more efficient routes)
    - Scenario 4: Merging all modifications to create an even more efficient route optimization
- The simulation includes various outcomes:
    - Time results are shown for each scenario

**Connection and Building Upon Surrounding Context:**

The current text chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing a summary of key papers related to ridesharing systems, highlighting their focus on aspects such as rebalancing strategies, modeling and mathematical frameworks, optimization heuristics, simulation and service design, flexible transport services, ride-sharing systems with meeting points, vehicle rebalancing for mobility-on-demand systems, flex-route services and ride-sharing, and the benefits of meeting points.
2. Recognizing that ridesharing is a critical aspect of social mobility and urban development, as stated in the concluding remarks.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The current text chunk does not explicitly mention any specific requirements, conditions, or constraints. However:

- The simulation relies on having access to a base network for optimization.
- The outcomes are likely dependent on real-world data, such as traffic patterns and population density.
- The scenarios presented may require further analysis to fully understand their implications.

Overall, the current text chunk provides an in-depth analysis of a specific aspect of ridesharing systems, shedding light on how routing strategies can impact efficiency and user satisfaction.
