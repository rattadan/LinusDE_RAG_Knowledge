- Line charts:These charts use a solid line to highlight the median closing price for a cryptocurrency over time. The closing price is a crypto assetâs final trading cost within a predefined period.
- Candlestick charts:The candlesticks in this chart pattern are rectangles symbolizing trading activity for a cryptocurrency within a specific time frame. For example, on a daily candlestick chart for Bitcoin (BTC), each candlestick is equivalent to 24 hours of BTC price fluctuations.
- Trading pair:This is a set of two assets that compare prices on a chart. Most often, crypto price charts pair a cryptocurrency with a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, for transparent price comparisons (e.g., a âBTC/USDâ pair quotes BTCâs prices in terms of U.S. dollars).
