## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 39

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

Effect of Demand
Four additional scenarios were run to observe the effect of SAV mode share on the network. Table 3 shows the fleet-level metrics and network effects for an SAV-reliant City arising from
the artificial change in mode preferences (while allowing for non-motorized and transit modes to
operate). SAV mode shares in these scenarios are around 60%, with the remaining share split

almost equally between walk/bike and other modes (like schoolbus trips). Transit shares are low
in the base scenario runs (less than 1%) and drop to almost 0% showing the trip attraction toward
SAVs. More reliable transit like in Chicago or NYC may retain some mode share (as evidenced
by Gurumurthy et al. (2021)).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details, Parameters, Processes:**

The text chunk describes a study by Gurumurthy and Kockelman, where the authors investigate the effect of Shared Auto Vehicle (SAV) mode shares on traffic congestion in urban areas.

Here are the specific technical details mentioned:

* Density: 5x, 25x, and various values for density
* Spacing: 0.25 mi
* Mode preferences:
	+ SAV mode share (SAV)
	+ Non-motorized modes (walk/bike)
	+ Transit modes

**Context Connection and Building Upon Surrounding Context:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

* Providing a specific research topic (Shared Autonomous Vehicles) and its scope
* Mentioning key authors (K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan) and their work in the field of urban transportation systems
* Referencing the timeframe (2014-2020) and highlighting recent developments in the field

The chunk also builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Providing additional information about the study's methodology and scope
* Highlighting key results and takeaways from the research, such as the effect of SAV mode shares on traffic congestion.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk. The text appears to be a straightforward description of the study's methodology and findings.

However, there are some implicit assumptions that may have been made:

* That the study is focused on urban transportation systems
* That the goal is to investigate the impact of SAV mode shares on traffic congestion
* That the study uses a specific set of parameters (e.g. density, spacing) and methodologies (e.g. simulation modeling)

Overall, the text provides a clear and concise description of the study's research question, methodology, and findings, which should be sufficient for researchers or practitioners in the field to understand the topic.
