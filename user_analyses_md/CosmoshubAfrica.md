Legitness: The account is Cosmos Hub Africa, which is a real project. They mention collaborations with Neutron, Cosmos, and ATOM Accelerator, which are known in the crypto space. The retweets from ATOM Accelerator and ChihuahuaChain add credibility. However, the content is more about promoting events and projects rather than specific news, so it's a bit generic.
