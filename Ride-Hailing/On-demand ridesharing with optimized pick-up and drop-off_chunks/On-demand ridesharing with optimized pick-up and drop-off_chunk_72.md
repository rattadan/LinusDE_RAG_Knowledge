**Original Text:**

• Average delay might increase or decrease depending on the scenario, which results from two opposing forces: shorter detours
reduce in-vehicle time, but walking the first or final legs is slower than riding a vehicle. Waiting times can also increase or decrease
when PUDO points are optimized. 14
