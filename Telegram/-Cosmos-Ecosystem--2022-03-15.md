## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. The text consists of several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account, each mentioning different projects, tokens, and features.

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. The earliest tweet is from 04:33:22 mentioning SputnikNetwork and ComdexOfficial connecting, allowing $CMDX transfers on Twitter and Telegram. So the main topics here are SputnikNetwork, ComdexOfficial, and CMDX.

Next, the tweet at 05:44:12 talks about a new article for StargazeZone by The_Boring_DAO. So StargazeZone and The_Boring_DAO are topics here.

Then at 05:45:18, another tweet mentions SputnikNetwork and StargazeZone again, along with $STARS. So STARS is another topic.

Moving to the tweets around 10:42:33, there's a focus on Juno Ecosystem growth with mentions of $JUNO, $NETA, $RAW, and various projects like wolfcontract, Core1_official, dimiandre, MarbleDaoCosmos, decentralizedns, junoswapdex, NetaMoney. These all should be included.

The tweets from 11:18:53 to 11:20:27 are all about CerberusZone and $CRBRUS, including auto-restaking, adding to Keplr Wallet, and airdrops. So CerberusZone and CRBRUS are key topics here.

At 12:03:22, there's a mention of a webpage for airdrops in Cosmos Ecosystem, so maybe airdrop or Cosmos Ecosystem itself as a topic.

The tweet at 12:05:20 refers to AssetMantle and another airdrop, so AssetMantle should be added.

Then from 16:12:28 to 16:56:35, there are more mentions of CerberusZone, $CRBRUS, airdrop alerts, and SputnikNetwork again. Also, the superfluid staking pools on OsmosisZone with $UST/OSMO and $LUNA/OSMO pairs,

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral.

First, I need to read through each tweet carefully. Let me start by looking at each one individually. The first tweet mentions an airdrop alert with emojis like üö® and üí•, which are attention-grabbing. Airdrops are usually positive because they're giving away tokens, so that's a positive sign.

Next, there's a tweet about superfluid staking pools with high APR percentages. High APRs are attractive to investors, so this seems positive too. Words like "superfluid" and the percentages might indicate excitement about opportunities.

Another tweet talks about a new chain being added after its launch, using "Fantastic!üî•". The exclamation and fire emoji definitely convey enthusiasm, so that's positive. They're celebrating the addition of a new network, which is a good thing.

Then there's a mention of enjoying another drop from AssetMantle. "Endless surprises" and the context of airdrops again suggest positivity. The use of an exclamation mark here also adds to that.

A tweet about a webpage for checking airdrops with a note that English will be available soon. It's informative but still has a positive tone because they're promoting a useful tool. The link might be neutral, but the overall message is helpful and positive.

There are several other tweets about adding tokens to wallets, auto-restaking, and stakers receiving rewards. These all highlight features or successes, using words like "available now" and "rocks today!" which are positive. Emojis like üî• and üí• reinforce that excitement.

Looking at the last few tweets, they mention networks connecting, sending tokens via Twitter and Telegram, and growing ecosystems. These are all positive developments, showing expansion and integration, which are good signs for a project.

Now, considering the entire set, the common themes are airdrops, new features, partnerships, high rewards, and ecosystem growth. The language used is enthusiastic with lots of exclamation points and positive emojis. There's no negative language here‚Äîno complaints, criticisms, or warnings. Even the neutral parts, like links or mentions, are framed within a positive context.

So, putting it all together, each tweet contributes to a positive sentiment. The account is promoting various aspects of the Cosmos ecosystem, highlighting successes and opportunities

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. I need to go through each tweet and identify any specific actions or steps mentioned.

Starting with the first tweet at 16:56:35. It's an airdrop alert for $CRBRUS from CerberusZone. The action item here might be to participate in the airdrop, but the tweet itself doesn't give a link or specific instructions. Maybe just noting the airdrop as an event to be aware of.

Next, the tweet at 16:26:37 mentions superfluid staking pools on Osmosis with high APRs for UST/OSMO and LUNA/OSMO. The action here is to stake in those pools. They provided links, so users should check them out. That's a clear next step.

Then at 16:12:28, they added new chains, SputnikNetwork and CerberusZone. The action might be to explore these new chains, maybe interact with them. But the tweet doesn't have a direct link except to their Twitter accounts. So perhaps noting that these chains are newly added and suggesting looking into them.

At 12:05:20, another airdrop from AssetMantle. Again, no direct link, but mentions to enjoy the drop. Maybe the action is to check if one is eligible or participate in that airdrop.

The tweet at 12:03:22 talks about a webpage to check airdrops in Cosmos Ecosystem and mentions using a translator since English will be available soon. The link provided is to that webpage. So the action item here is to visit the webpage and use a translator if needed.

At 11:20:27, there's a link to add $CRBRUS to Keplr wallet. That's a direct action: users should follow the link to add the token.

Another tweet at 11:19:45 mentions auto-restaking for $CRBRUS is available. The link provided leads to where they can do that. So the action is to use the auto-restaking feature via the link.

At 11:18:53, they note that $HUAHUA stakers received $CRBRUS
