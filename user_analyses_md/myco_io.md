The hashtag #DigitalIdentity and #PrivacyTech are there. So the main themes are Web3, blockchain, digital identity, privacy, and innovation in security.

Next, the language style. Both tweets are formal and use emojis like üöó‚ö°, üí´, üîêüë§. They have a positive and enthusiastic tone, with words like "bold ideas," "unforgettable moments," and "big love."
