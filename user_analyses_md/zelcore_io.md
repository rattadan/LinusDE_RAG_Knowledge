3. Evaluation of legitimacy
- The tweets appear legitimate as they come from what looks like an official account (@zelcore_io).
- The message is consistent across tweets and focuses on their own product rather than making unrealistic promises or asking for money directly.
- The tweets don't appear to contain obvious red flags like too-good-to-be-true returns or requests for personal information.
