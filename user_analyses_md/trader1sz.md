Putting some tweets into bigger context:
The repeated mentions of $BERT suggest this is a project that trader1sz is particularly invested in or sees potential in, especially noting its IP licensing, brand partnerships, and development outside purely crypto. The frequent references to "engagement" numbers indicate trader1sz is paying attention to which memecoins are gaining traction in the Pumpfun ecosystem. The shift from short-term trading to swing trading with "simple TA concepts" suggests trader1sz is evolving their approach based on experience.
