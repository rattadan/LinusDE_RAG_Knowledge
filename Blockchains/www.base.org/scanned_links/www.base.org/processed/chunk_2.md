### Document Overview  
This content outlines Base.org's vision to build an open financial system with low fees and fast transactions, emphasizing its role as an Ethereum Layer 2, decentralized with the Optimism Superchain, and its phased approach to reaching billions of users.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Ethereum L2**: Base is built as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, leveraging Optimism Superchain for scalability.  
- **Public Goods Funding**: Base builders qualify for Optimism's retroactive funding, incentivizing community contributions.  
- **Four-Phase Strategy**: Base’s roadmap targets 1M, 10M, 100M, and 1B+ users, with each phase focusing on specific financial ecosystem components (e.g., exchanges, apps, onramps).  
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Base aims to create an open, decentralized financial system through its ecosystem of builders, grants, and onramps.  
- **Onramps**: Multi-currency entry points (in 190+ countries) enabling users to bridge local currencies into digital assets.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Phased Development**:  
  - **Phase 1**: Protocol development (1M users).  
  - **Phase 2**: Digital currency exchange (10M users).  
  - **Phase 3**: Mass-market interface (100M users).  
  - **Phase 4**: Open financial system (1B+ users).  
- **Superchain Integration**: Base’s infrastructure is built on the Optimism Superchain, enabling low-cost, fast transactions.  
- **Grants & Marketing**: Builders receive funding through grants, marketing, and Superchain eligibility for public goods funding.  
- **Onramps**: Multi-currency bridges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) facilitate cross-border transactions.  

### Related Topics  
- **Base Contributors**: The document references contributions from builders, developers, and the Optimism Superchain.  
- **Optimism Superchain**: A foundational layer for Base’s scalability and interoperability.  
- **Public Goods Funding**: A mechanism for incentivizing developers to build for the broader ecosystem.  
- **Ethereum Layer 2**: Base’s technical foundation for low fees and fast transactions.

apps in the Base ecosystem.

Bring your assets to Base.

Our vision to keep fees low (below 1 cent) and transactions fast (below 1 second) will help bring the next billion people onchain.

The Base economy is made up of millions of people, thousands of builders, and onramps in 190+ countries.

Base is built as an Ethereum L2, decentralized with theOptimism Superchain, and incubated by Coinbase.

Base supports passionate builders making apps for everyday life with grants, marketing, and as part of the Superchain, Base builders are eligible for consideration in Optimism's retroactive public goods funding.

From the beginning,our secret master planhas been clear and consistent: create an open financial system that increases economic freedom globally by moving deliberately through four phases.

New protocols (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) were invented and people began to tinker with them. Open source communities developed around each protocol and early adopters began experimenting with how they could be used.

Coinbase started here. Investment or speculation is a bootstrapping mechanism for a payment network (in other words, it is thesingle-player modeof digital currency). And the creation of safe and easy to use exchanges served as abridgefor people to get their local currency into and out of digital currency.
