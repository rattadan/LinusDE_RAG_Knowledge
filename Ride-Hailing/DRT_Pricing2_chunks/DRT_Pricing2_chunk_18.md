## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 18

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

When considering assignment approaches, significant differences can
be seen between settings with immediate and delayed responses. For
immediate responses, the strategies are rather simple. In Bailey and
Clark (1992), a request is assigned to the closest vehicle. In their
experiments, the authors examine if considering all or just non-serving
vehicles for assignment leads to better results. Maciejewski and Nagel
(2013) assign requests to their closest vehicle as well, but allow later
reassignments in case the closest vehicle changes due to unexpected
delays. Bischoff and Maciejewski (2016) use a strategy depending
on the current supplyâ€“demand-ratio that either assigns a request to
the closest available vehicle or assigns a vehicle to the closest open
request. Lu et al. (2012) present similar strategies for electric vehicles. Here, the current battery load as well as the demand in the destination
zone are considered in the assignment.
