# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_37.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
This content provides technical details about Ethereum transactions, including gas pricing, account activity, contract usage, and transaction metadata, aimed at developers and users understanding blockchain behavior and performance.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Gas Price**: The fee per unit of gas, determining transaction cost and priority.  
- **Gas Used**: Actual gas consumed by a transaction, impacting fee calculations.  
- **Nonce**: A unique transaction number (starts at 0), tracking transaction sequence.  
- **Transaction Fee**: Calculated as `Gas Price × Gas Used`, paid to validators.  
- **Block & Timestamp**: Details of when a transaction is included in a block.  
- **Account Activity**: Metrics like ETH balance, tokens, and transaction history.  
- **Contracts**: Deployed contracts and their usage statistics.  
- **Validators**: Nodes validating transactions and ensuring network consistency.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Gas Estimation**:  
  - Average transaction gas: ~21,000–30,000 units (estimated).  
  - Fast transaction gas: ~10,000–15,000 units (lower cost, higher priority).  
- **Fee Calculation**: `Transaction Fee = Gas Price × Gas Used` (e.g., $10/eth × 20,000 = $200).  
- **Nonce Management**: Starts at 0; a nonce of 100 represents the 101st transaction by the account.  
- **Block Inclusion**: Transactions are validated by validators and added to blocks with timestamps.  
- **Contract Deployment**: The `Contract Creator` field identifies the address that deployed a contract.  

### Related Topics  
- **Ethereum Consensus**: Connections to validator mechanisms and block validation processes.  
- **Account Balances & Tokens**: Link to Ethereum's balance and token management systems.  
- **Transaction History**: Related to blockchain analytics tools and user activity tracking.  
- **Gas Pricing Models**: Tie to Ethereum's gas pricing strategies and market dynamics.

price and duration)
- Estimated units of gas needed for an average transaction (+ estimated price and duration)
- Estimated units of gas needed for a fast transaction (+ estimated price and duration)
- Average confirmation time based on gas price
- Contracts that are consuming gas - in other words, popular products that are seeing lots of usage on the network
- Accounts that are spending gas - in other words, frequent network users
- Transaction hash - A hash generated when the transaction is submitted
- Status - An indication of whether the transaction is pending, failed or a success
- Block - The block in which the transaction has been included
- Timestamp - The time at which a transaction was included in a block proposed by a validator
- From - The address of the account that submitted the transaction
- To - The address of the recipient or smart contract that the transaction interacts with
- Tokens transferred - A list of tokens that were transferred as part of the transaction
- Value - The total ETH value being transferred
- Transaction fee - The amount paid to the validator to process the transaction (calculated by gas price*gas used)
- Gas limit - The maximum numbers of gas units this transaction can consume
- Gas used - The actual amount of gas units the transaction consumed
- Gas price - The price set per gas unit
- Nonce - The transaction number for thefromaddress (bear in mind this starts at 0 so a nonce of100would actually be the 101st transaction submitted by this account)
- Input data - Any extra information required by the transaction
- Account address - The public address you can use to send funds to
- ETH balance - The amount of ETH associated with that account
- Total ETH value - The value of the ETH
- Tokens - The tokens associated with the account and their value
- Transaction history - A list of all the transactions where this account was either the sender or the recipient
- Contract creator - The address that deployed the contract to Mainnet
