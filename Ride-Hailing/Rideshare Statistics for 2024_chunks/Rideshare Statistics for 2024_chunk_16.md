**Original Text:**

What Is Rideshare Insurance? Rideshare insurance covers the gaps in TNC coverage, protecting rideshare drivers when they’re waiting for a customer and driving to a ride. It’s a commercial car insurance policy the driver can add on to their regular, private passenger auto insurance. What Does It Cover? Rideshare insurance offers the same coverages as a personal policy, which include the following. Bodily injury liability: If you cause an accident, bodily injury liability coverage will pay for the injuries of everyone outside of your car. Property damage liability: Property damage will pay for any property you damage outside of your vehicle. Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage: If you get into an accident with someone with no or insufficient insurance, this coverage would pay for your injuries and damages.
