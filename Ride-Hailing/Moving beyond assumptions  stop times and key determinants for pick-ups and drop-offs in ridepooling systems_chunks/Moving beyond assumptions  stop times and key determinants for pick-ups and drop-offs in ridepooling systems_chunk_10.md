**Original Text:**

Through multiple on-site observations during actual service operations, we
collected and analysed data for 226 meticulously observed stop events and passenger
dwells. The results of this study offer empirical-based evidence for the stop time parameter
in future ridepooling operations and contribute to more accurate simulation models. Literature review
Several recent DRT simulation studies focusing on the efficiency (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017;
Kucharski and Cats 2024; Stumpe et al. 2024), on traffic impacts (Bilali, Fastenrath, and
Bogenberger 2022), on fleet control (Armellini 2021; HÃ¶rl et al. 2018; Kaddoura and Schlenther 2021), on travel times (Wang, Noland, and Huang 2024) or on stop network design
(Tamleh, Schlenther, and Nagel 2024) omit specific stop time details in their publications,
i.e. they do not explicitly mention the stop durations for PUDO events.
