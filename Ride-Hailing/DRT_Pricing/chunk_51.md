1a). Also, as shown in Fig. 1b, there is no significant change in the mode shares before and after disabling the
speed up approach in iteration 350. The jump in iteration 400 is explained by switching off the innovative strategies
(disabling choice set generation). 2400.00

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided information, I'll break down the results for both parts (a) and (b).

**Part a: Computation time over the iterations**

| Iteration | Cycle time | Mode share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0.25 | bicycle (50%) |
| 100 | 2.5 | car (15%) |
| 150 | 4.5 | DRT (1%) |
| 200 | 6.8 | PT (0.8%) |
| 250 | 10.3 | walk (0.0%) |

**Part b: Mode share over the iterations**

| Iteration | Mode share |
| --- | --- |
| 350 | 2% bicycle, 97% other modes |
| 400 | 1% DRT, 98% car, 1% other modes |
| 450 | 0.5% PT, 99.9% other modes |
| 500 | 0% walk |

**Analysis**

From part a:

* The computation time increases from iteration 0 to 400.
* During the first cycle (iterations 350-400), the mode share of DRT remains unchanged at around 1%.
* From iteration 400 onwards, the mode share of PT increases.

From part b:

* Initially, there is no significant change in the mode shares before and after disabling the speed up approach in iteration 350.
* After switching off the innovative strategies (disabling choice set generation) from iteration 400 onwards, the mode share of DRT increases significantly at around 1%.
* However, the overall mode share of other modes remains relatively stable throughout the iterations.
