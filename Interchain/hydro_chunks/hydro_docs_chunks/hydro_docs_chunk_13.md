**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

Once a user selects a bid, their entire available voting power is used to support it. The voting power remains locked until the end of the voting round. If a user decides to change their vote within the same tranche, they can do so before the voting period ends. They can still only vote for one bid in the tranche. Once the voting round concludes, tribute (rewards) is distributed to voters based on the amount of voting power they used to support the winning bids. ## Custom Durations
----------------

Users need to consider the duration of each bid. Protocol-owned liquidity (PoL) represents the liquidity allocated by Hydro to support projects, and the bid duration determines how long the liquidity will remain with the project. Your locked ATOM duration must match or exceed the bid duration of the bid you want to vote for. For example, a bid has a duration of 3 months, but your lockup is only for 1 month; you wonâ€™t be able to vote for that bid.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the text chunk and its context:**

1. **Technical details and parameters:**
   - The voting power remains locked until the end of the voting round.
   - Users can change their vote within the same tranche before the voting period ends.
   - Users can vote for only one bid in the tranche.
   - Tribute is distributed to voters based on the amount of voting power they used to support the winning bids.
   - PoL represents the liquidity allocated by Hydro to support projects, and bid duration determines how long the liquidity will remain with the project.
   - Users need to match or exceed the bid duration with their locked ATOM duration to vote for a bid.
   - The voting power depends on the amount of Liquid Staking Module (LSM) shares locked and the duration of the lockup (referenced from the "Lockups and Voting Power" section).

2. **Connection to the surrounding context:**
   The text chunk builds upon the voting mechanism and bidding process discussed in the previous sections. It explains how users engage with the system by voting for bids and how the tribute rewards are distributed based on their voting power.

3. **Specific requirements and conditions:**
   - Users must match or exceed the bid duration with their locked ATOM duration to vote for a bid.
   - Votes can be changed within the same tranche before the voting period ends, but users can only vote for one bid in the tranche.

**Factually stated points with potential ambiguity:**
While not explicitly stated, it seems that the voting round duration is a crucial component for determining when tribute is distributed to voters and when votes can be changed.
