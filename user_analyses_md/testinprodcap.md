**Context for Tweets 1 and 2:**

Tweets 1 and 2 appear to be responding to each other, possibly in response to Bitcoin's recent price fluctuations. Tweet 1 mentions that the spread (the time it takes for a chef to cook something delicious) is the same as Bitcoin's current price movement, suggesting that there is no clear indication of an imminent correction. In contrast, tweet 2 suggests that gold might be heading towards an abyss due to Bitcoin's perceived overvalued position.
