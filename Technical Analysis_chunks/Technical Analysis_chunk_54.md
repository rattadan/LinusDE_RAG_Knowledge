**Document Summary:**

**Key Points:**

* Technical analysis is a method used by traders to predict where the market might be heading by studying charts, patterns, and various technical indicators.
* Technical indicators are like tools that help traders make sense of price data and are used in technical analysis.
* Types of technical indicators include volume, momentum, and trend indicators, which can be grouped together.

MACD is used by technical traders in stock, bond, commodities, and FX markets. (Source)

Which is better, RSI or MACD? When it comes to strengths and weaknesses, moving average convergence divergence is a momentum indicator that is better at identifying trend reversals. On the other hand, relative strength index is better at identifying overbought or oversold conditions. However, combining both indicators can provide a more comprehensive view of the market. (Source)

How to use MACD effectively? The strategy is to buy – or close a short position – when the moving average convergence divergence crosses above the zero line, and sell – or close a long position – when the MACD crosses below the zero line. This method should be used carefully, as the delayed nature means that fast, choppy markets would often see the signals issued too late. (Source)
