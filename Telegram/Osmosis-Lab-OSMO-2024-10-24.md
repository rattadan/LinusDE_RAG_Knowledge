## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages, so I need to parse through each line and pick out the important stuff.

First, I notice several automated messages from osmosis_statbot and osmosis_news. They're just promoting support sites and links, so probably not crucial beyond mentioning the support site once.

Then there's some Russian message from user_7164487109, but it's just a greeting. Not important for the summary.

The main discussion starts with krill808 asking about moving WBTC on Osmosis. kychuli explains that WBTC on Osmosis is natively issued and provides a link. Then there's a back-and-forth about bridging SOL from Osmosis to Solana. RowUtr mentions using Portal Bridge, but kychuli clarifies that you need to swap SOL to SOL.wh first on Osmosis because Portal only recognizes the wormhole version. Then there's a mention of Squid router as an alternative.

Another user, ndcast, is concerned about a WBTC contract not being verified on Mintscan. kychuli refers to a forum post and explains that even though the contract isn't verified, the info is still valid. ndcast also asks about earning through liquidity provision, but kychuli's response points to specific pools.

So the key points are:
1. How to bridge SOL from Osmosis to Solana via Portal, requiring a swap to SOL.wh first.
2. WBTC on Osmosis is natively issued, with a link to the dashboard.
3. Contract verification issue on Mintscan, but info is confirmed legitimate.
4. Liquidity provision opportunities in specific BTC pools.

I need to structure this clearly, maybe in bullet points, mentioning the users involved but keeping it concise. Also, note the decisions made, like using Portal after swapping, and the verification status. Avoid the less relevant parts like greetings and repeated support links. Make sure to include the necessary links as well.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Bridging SOL from Osmosis to Solana**:  
   - Use **Portal Bridge** (https://portalbridge.com/cosmos/) but first swap Osmosis' SOL token (a basket of Wormhole and Picasso versions) to **SOL

## üîç Topics & Themes

> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the given text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand the text. It looks like a chat log with various messages from different users. The main topics would be the recurring themes or subjects discussed here.

Looking at the messages, I see several instances of users asking about bridging tokens, specifically SOL from Osmosis to Solana. There's mention of using Portal Bridge and swapping tokens, like SOL to .wh version. Also, there's a link to a support site and some discussions about WBTC contracts not being verified on Mintscan. Another user mentions working with Bitgo, which relates to WBTC issuers. There's a question about earning by providing liquidity and some references to specific pools on Osmosis.

So, the main topics seem to be: Bridging tokens (especially SOL via Portal Bridge), Swapping tokens (SOL to .wh, WBTC), WBTC contracts verification issues, Liquidity provision (and where to do it), Support links, and maybe the use of specific platforms like Osmosis and Solana. Also, there's a mention of a WBTC issuer related to Bitgo and Axelar. The pump on meme madness is another point but might be less central. I need to ensure I capture the most discussed points without including too many specifics like individual user names or timestamps. Let me list these out and check if they cover all the key discussions without being redundant.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this chat log. Let me start by reading through each message to understand the context and emotions expressed.

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's neutral since it's just a help link. Then hleb_albau mentions auto-translation from Russian, which is also neutral. User_7164487109 says hello in Russian, so neutral again.

RowUtr at 2024-10-24T17:55:30+00:00 thanks for the help and mentions catching a +30% pump on meme madness, profiting. That sounds positive because they're happy with the assistance and made a profit. Osmosis_news and griffin_web3 share links, which are neutral. Svansy asks about bridging from Osmosis over Portal, unsure where to do it. That's a question seeking help, so probably neutral.

Looking at the next set: osmosis_statbot again shares the support link (neutral). Kychuli and RowUtr are discussing moving SOL from Osmosis to Solana. RowUtr asks for the best way, and Kychuli suggests Portalbridge with a swap. These are informational, so neutral. Then ndcast mentions working with Bitgo, which is neutral. Kychuli explains WBTC issuers and alloyed SOL, which is technical info, neutral.

Ndcast expresses concern about a contract not being verified after a year, which sounds negative. They were worried because they wanted to trade but found it legit. The words "concerned" and "shady" indicate negative sentiment here. Kychuli responds with a link, which is neutral. Ndcast checks another link and shares a contract address, still neutral.

Kychuli later explains WBTC on Osmosis, neutral. Ndcast asks who's behind WBTC not Axelar, which is a question but shows uncertainty, maybe leaning neutral. Krill808 and Kychuli discuss SOL vs WSOL, technical details, so neutral. Krill808 initially confused but then figures it out, so no strong sentiment. Kychuli mentions wrapping tokens, which is a limitation but stated factually, so neutral.

Overall, most messages are neutral, providing information or asking questions. The only negative part is ndcast

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see if there's anything actionable mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's more of a general help notice, not an action item for the users. Then there's a translated message from hleb_albau, but it's just a note about translation, no action there.

User_7164487109 says hello, so no action. RowUtr thanks for help and mentions catching a pump, which is a success story but not an action item. Osmosis_news shares a link, probably not an action item. Griffin_web3 shares a link to portalbridge.com, which might be relevant for later steps.

Svansy asks how to bridge from Osmosis using Portal and mentions there's nowhere to do it. That's a question, so the next step would be someone answering that. Then osmosis_statbot again with the support link.

Looking at kychuli's message at 09:57, they suggest using portalbridge.com and swapping from alloyed SOL to SOL.wh on Osmosis. So that's a decision or next step: swap SOL to SOL.wh before bridging. RowUtr asks about Squid router, which is another possible action. Then RowUtr again asks for the best way to move SOL from Osmosis to Solana. The answer here would be the next step, which kychuli provided: use portalbridge and swap first.

Ndcast mentions working with Bitgo, which is a statement, not an action. Kychuli says the WBTC issuer is same as ETH Bitgo. Then there's a discussion about contract verification on Mintscan. Ndcast is concerned because the contract isn't verified, which might require the owner to verify it. Kychuli provides a link to a forum post about uploading the contract, which could be an action item for the owner to verify.

Ndcast asks how to earn by providing liquidity, so the next step is to check the provided link for liquidity pools. Kychuli's message about WBTC being part of the alloy points to specific pools. Ndcast checks Celatone link and mentions the contract not being verified. Kych
