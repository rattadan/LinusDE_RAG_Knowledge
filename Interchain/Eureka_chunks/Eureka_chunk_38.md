## Eureka - Chunk 38

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

This is a very conservative setting, but it even with these “high amounts”, fees are still fractions of a cent. EVM Transactions
This doc covers how to interact with the EvmTx type returned by the Skip Go API

​
Intro
When a user needs to transfer or swap from an EVM chain (e.g. Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc…), the Skip Go API will return an EvmTx type for the developer to pass to the user for signing
Unlike CosmosSDK transactions, EVM transactions do not have a notion of messages, so this object doesn’t correspond 1-to-1 to a “message”, which might be a more familiar notion to Cosmos developers
This doc is intended for CosmosSDK developers who aren’t already familiar with the concepts of transaction construction in the EVM and need to use EvmTx to help their users move from/to EVM chains.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk provides detailed technical information about various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, including IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol), Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane (Secured by Interchain Security Modules, or ISMs), and Go Fast. Here's a focused analysis of what this specific section is explaining:

1. **Technical Details**: The chunk describes the technical details of each protocol, including potential failure points such as timeouts, slippage, and token re-direction. For example:
	* IBC: Potential for timeouts or slippage when swapping assets between chains.
	* Axelar GMP: Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts and slippage issues.
	* Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP): The service outage of the attestation service can lead to funds being inaccessible for users.
2. **Connects to or Builds Upon Surrounding Context**: This chunk connects to the surrounding context by explaining how each protocol is used in a cross-chain asset transfer scenario:
	* Each protocol requires specific technical knowledge and implementation details.
	* Understanding these protocols is essential for building reliable and efficient cross-chain transfer systems.
3. **Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints**: The chunk mentions specific requirements and conditions that must be met to implement each protocol successfully:
	* Incentives are necessary to encourage relayers to operate profitably rather than as charities.
	* Robust error handling mechanisms are required to mitigate potential failures.

In terms of building upon the surrounding context:

* The text assumes a certain level of technical expertise in the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and cross-chain asset transfer concepts, which is often necessary for developers familiar with CosmosSDK.
* The chunk provides a clear overview of each protocol's functionality and limitations, making it easier for developers to implement them correctly.

Overall, this text chunk offers valuable insights into the technical details and requirements of various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, providing a solid foundation for building reliable and efficient systems.
