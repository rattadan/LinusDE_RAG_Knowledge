# Robotaxi Technology (Baidu Apollo Go) - Chunk 2
Baidu's Apollo Go has developed the RT6, its sixth-generation robotaxi, which is a purpose-built Level 4 autonomous vehicle designed without the need for a human driver. A key innovation is the vehicle's cost-effectivenessâ€”adopting a battery-swapping solution has brought the manufacturing cost to under $30,000 per vehicle, significantly lower than competitors like Waymo, whose vehicles are estimated to cost over $150,000 each. This cost advantage allows Apollo Go to offer rides starting at just 4 yuan (approximately $0.55), compared to 18 yuan ($2.48) for traditional taxis.
