This content outlines FRAX and sFRAX, stablecoins issued by Frax Finance, their collateralized/algorithmic mechanisms, and their role in the Cosmos ecosystem via Noble. It also includes legal terms and links to developer resources.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Stablecoins**: FRAX (pegged to USD) and sFRAX (yield-exposed staked token).

### Implementation Details  
- **Assets**: FRAX and sFRAX are tied to USD (USDC) and other assets (e.g., USDN, USDY, EURe).  
- **Issuance Mechanism**: Noble enables decentralized issuance of FRAX, with sFRAX as a staked token.  
- **Technical Terms**: "Peg stability" (FRAX’s goal), "yield exposure" (sFRAX’s objective), and "collateralized assets" (FRAX’s foundation).  
- **Developer Resources**: Links to GitHub, Docs, and the Developer Hub for technical details.  

### Related Topics
