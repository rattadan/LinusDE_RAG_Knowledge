Putting these tweets in context of the author's intentions:
SamuelXeus appears to be an active participant in crypto/NFT communities who is trying to build hype and awareness for projects they've invested in, particularly Humanity Protocol and Plume Network. Their style suggests they're attempting to position themselves as an influencer or key community member who can help drive adoption and value for these projects. They use humor, simplified rules for engagement, and speculative price predictions to generate interest and FOMO among potential investors.

The tweets suggest a strategy of promoting projects through consistent posting ("never skip a post"), insightful commentary, and cross-promotion with other popular NFTs or projects ("the next Borpa"). They're also trying to establish credibility by mentioning real developments like exchange listings and partnerships while mixing these with more speculative claims about future prices.

The reference to Zerion app suggests they're portraying the lifestyle of a crypto investor who constantly monitors their portfolio, while the "gHumanity" and "gPlume" style language indicates they're trying to create community slogans or mantras.
