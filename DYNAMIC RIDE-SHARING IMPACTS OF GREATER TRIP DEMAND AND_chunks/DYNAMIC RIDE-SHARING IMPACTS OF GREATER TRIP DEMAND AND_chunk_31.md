## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 31

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

Figure 3 shows the total travel distance-weighted AVO and percent eVMT as a function of trip
density and assumed PUDO zone spacing. Even with trip density as currently observed, an AVO
of 1.7 is attained while counting single-party requests only, and this increases with increases in
trip density. The choice of PUDO spacing also has a similar effect on AVO. The effect size of
stop spacing on AVO decreases with higher demand but remains marginal across all densities. It
is important to keep in mind that travelers may be unwilling to walk the extra mile, so the AVO
increase estimated here is from travelers who were willing to walk to a PUDO location
(assuming similar weights in the mode choice as in-vehicle travel time), as well as to share a
ride. Greater eVMT reductions are observed as trip density increases, since the probability of
finding a traveler increases throughout the region.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details related to "AVO" (Average Originating Vehicle) and "eVMT" (Effective Virtual Travel Time), which seem to be metrics used in urban transportation studies.

The exact technical details described are:

* AVO: Average Originating Vehicle, a metric used to measure the likelihood of an individual traveling from one location to another.
* eVMT: Effective Virtual Travel Time, the average time spent by a traveler in the virtual environment (i.e., their travel time without considering factors like walkability or bikeability).

This connection to the surrounding context can be understood through the following:

1. The text provides a background on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance and its potential impacts on urban transportation systems.
2. It mentions that the references cover various topics related to shared fleets, such as congestion pricing with self-driving cars, parking needs for shared fleets, consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use, optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services, effects on vehicle ownership and emissions, and more.
3. The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, indicating that this section is providing historical context and highlighting recent developments in the field.

Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned include:

* AVO of 1.7: This value represents an average originating vehicle, which is likely a threshold for acceptable travel behavior.
* eVMT reductions as trip density increases: This indicates that increasing trip density can lead to more effective use of shared fleets and reduced travel time.
* Travelers may be unwilling to walk the extra mile: This implies that factors like urban planning or infrastructure design are influencing travel decisions.

In terms of analysis, this section is providing technical details on a specific aspect of shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance, which is essential for understanding the potential impacts of self-driving cars on urban transportation systems.
