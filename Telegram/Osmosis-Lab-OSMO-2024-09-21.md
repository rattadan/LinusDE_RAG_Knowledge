## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions.

Looking at the messages, there's a lot of discussion about ICP coming to Cosmos, which USDCJesus mentions at the start and end. Then there's a bunch of back-and-forth between users like Svansy, lakidude, and BasementNodes. They're arguing about Osmosis developers, comparing Thorswap and Rango to Osmo, and some are critical of the team being "lost" or behind. There's also talk about a potential merger between Cosmos Hub and Solana's meme coins, like Bonk, which Svansy and USDCJesus mention. 

Another issue is the technical problems with IBC transfers involving CUDOS and the limit orders on dym that aren't showing up. Users like tianzhi858 and Shadowwater123 are discussing network issues and how to cancel orders. There's a mention of Chainscope possibly shutting down Osmosis support due to funding issues from GPKwee. 

Also, there's a lot of references to airdrops, specifically Polaris and Hall, with users upset that they might be canceled. BasementNodes and others are sarcastic about farming airdrops being a bad idea. 

I need to structure this into main topics: ICP integration, technical issues with IBC and limit orders, comparisons with other projects, potential Cosmos-Solana collaborations, and the airdrop cancellations. Highlight the key decisions or points like the ICP announcement, technical problems, criticisms of Osmosis devs, merger ideas, and the airdrop concerns. Avoid the less relevant comments like "clown response" or "bruh" unless they contribute to the main points. Make sure to note the support link provided by the bot. 

Wait, the user mentioned focusing on key points and decisions. So the technical issues and the ICP integration are important. The criticisms of Osmosis devs being behind might be a key point. The merger idea between Cosmos and Solana meme coins is a discussion point. Airdrop cancellations and the Chainscope support issue are also key. Need to present these clearly and concisely, leaving out the less meaningful banter. Also note the timestamps to see the flow, but maybe not necessary unless time-sensitive.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by reading through the entire text to understand the context.

The text is a series of chat messages from different users. The timestamps are in UTC, and the usernames vary. The messages seem to be related to cryptocurrency, specifically Cosmos (OSMO), Osmosis, and other blockchain projects like Thorswap, Rango, Solana, EVM, IBC, and some meme coins. There's mention of technical issues, such as IBC transfers not working, limit orders not displaying, and relayer problems. Also, there's talk about airdrops, tokens like Polaris, and some community interactions.

First, I'll look for recurring themes or topics. Let's go through each message:

1. USDCJesus mentions ICP coming to Cosmos. So, "ICP integration with Cosmos" could be a topic.
2. Osmosis_statbot links to support site. Maybe "Osmosis support resources" but not sure if that's a main topic.
3. Lakidude says "Aragones RIP" ‚Äì Aragones might be a person or project related to Cosmos.
4. Svansy and others discuss payments, paychecks, possibly related to validators or developers.
5. WorkerBee_3 talks about chain abstraction and navigating crypto without custody wallets. So "chain abstraction" and "non-custodial wallets".
6. There's a comparison between Thorchain and Osmosis, mentioning Cosmos SDK. So "Thorchain vs Osmosis" or "Cosmos SDK usage".
7. Lakidude criticizes Osmo devs for lagging behind Thorswap and Rango. "Osmo development delays" or "Thorswap/Rango comparison".
8. Svansy compares different products, like Adidas and Crocs. Maybe "product comparisons in blockchain".
9. Discussions about IBC and EVM routers. "IBC vs EVM routers".
10. Mention of Solana and Cosmos integration. "Cosmos-Solana integration".
11. Issues with Cudos IBC transfers and stuck funds. "Cudos IBC issues".
12. Problems with limit orders not showing on dym and using Celatone. "Limit order visibility issues" and "Celatone usage".
13. Airdrop discussions, including Polaris, Jupiter, and Coin

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

The first message is from USDCJesus saying "Oh yay ICP is coming to cosmos" ‚Äì "yay" indicates positive sentiment. Then there's a support message from osmosis_statbot, which is neutral. Next, lakidude says "Aragones RIP" ‚Äì RIP usually signals something negative, like the end of something. 

Svansy's message "basically the only one to get paid lol" ‚Äì the "lol" might make it neutral, but "only one to get paid" could be a bit negative if they're implying others aren't getting paid. BasementNodes says "I am too a little bit" ‚Äì seems neutral. Then a few messages from lostreply with phrases like "basic reply", "common reply", etc. These are probably neutral as they're just describing the replies.

Svansy again: "by who. i am missing a couple of pay checks." ‚Äì negative sentiment here about missing pay. lakidude says "Rest are all paid..." which might be positive, but in context of previous messages, maybe neutral. WorkerBee_3 mentions "max is max smart guy" and lakidude says "Max is the only smart guy" ‚Äì positive towards Max but could be sarcasm. 

lakidude's message "No troll, no drugs, no fud... Always the classic replies..." ‚Äì seems negative towards the replies, maybe frustration. The "üòÇüòÇ" in "Osmo ftw üòÇüòÇ" could indicate sarcasm, so maybe negative. Svansy's "gotta be a troll or super drunk" is negative. 

Comparing products and saying "you are embarrassing yourself" ‚Äì negative. "Best mod reply" from lakidude is positive. WorkerBee_3's "are you hallucinating that fast?" sounds negative or sarcastic. BasementNodes "I won't be part of your system, maaaaaan" ‚Äì negative refusal. 

"Democrat detected. Opinion rejected" ‚Äì negative and possibly trolling. Svansy's comparison about houses and products seems critical, maybe negative. "Please eat my dog" from lakidude is odd, maybe negative or just a joke. "Some of you are from Springfield" ‚Äì neutral, maybe a reference. 

"Cries in

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify any that indicate a task, a decision made, or a plan for what comes next.

Starting from the top, USDCJesus mentions ICP coming to Cosmos. That's a statement, not an action item. The next message from osmosis_statbot is a link to support, which might be a resource but not an action item. Lakidude says "Aragones RIP" ‚Äì probably a comment, not an action.

Looking at Svansy's message about missing paychecks, and BasementNodes responding "I am too a little bit." Not sure if that's an action. Then WorkerBee_3 says "chain abstraction for user experience." Maybe that's a decision or a goal. Another message from WorkerBee_3 mentions that Osmo devs have been talking about this since IBC launched, so they're on track. That's more of an observation.

There's a discussion comparing Thorchain and another project, with Svansy criticizing someone for comparing different products. Lakidude calls Osmo devs lost. BasementNodes tells someone they're not in EVMland, implying maybe a decision to stay non-EVM? WorkerBee_3 talks about navigating crypto without custody wallets, which could be a strategic direction.

Then there's a bunch of messages about airdrops, specifically Polaris and Jupiter. USDCJesus asks about the Polaris airdrop, Mmtrack says no Polaris token. BasementNodes mentions farming airdrops being stupid. GPKwee and others talk about wash trading and funds stuck. 

Looking for specific actions: tianzhi858 mentions a problem with Cudos relayer and stuck funds. GPKwee says it's not a network issue but Cudos relayer. So maybe next steps here involve checking with the Cudos relayer or contacting support. 

Shadowwater123 had an issue with limit orders not showing and kychuli suggests checking stage.osmosis.zone or using Celatone. Then kychuli offers to walk through cancelling the order. So possible action items here are Shadowwater123 needs to check the transaction on a block explorer or contact support to cancel the order. 

Another part where BasementNodes says they built their explorer custom
