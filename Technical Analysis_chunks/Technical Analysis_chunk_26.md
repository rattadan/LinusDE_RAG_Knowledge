**Original Text:**

For example, the market has been in an uptrend for weeks or months, and then suddenly a death cross appears, which could mean the uptrend is finished and the market will turn into the other direction. Golden_Cross

An example of the Death cross in the 4H ETH/BTC chart, based on the 50 EMA and 100 EMA 200 EMA. A Golden cross or a Death cross can either be the 50 EMA crossing the 100 EMA or the 200 EMA. The higher the EMA period crossing, the stronger the signal. In this example we see 100 EMA crossing down the 200 EMA, which is one of the strongest cross signals you can find.

   - **Golden Cross**: a bullish signal formed when the short-term moving average (50 MA/EMA) crosses above the long-term moving average (100 MA/200 EMA) in a chart.
   - **Death Cross**: a bearish signal formed when the short-term moving average (50 MA/EMA) crosses below the long-term moving average (100 MA/200 EMA) in a chart.

   The text chunk also mentions that the higher the EMA period crossing, the stronger the signal. It uses the example of the 100 EMA crossing down the 200 EMA as one of the strongest cross signals.
2. **Context Connection:** This chunk builds upon the concept of moving averages mentioned in the **Moving Averages Summary** section. It shows how moving averages can be used to identify support and resistance levels in a market.
