### Document Overview  
This content outlines the terms of an arbitration agreement between the parties, detailing rules for individual claims, dispute resolution procedures, and enforcement under the Federal Arbitration Act.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Individual Basis Claims**: The agreement allows only individual lawsuits, not class or representative actions, to ensure fairness.  
- **Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution**: Parties must first attempt amicable resolution via email before proceeding to arbitration.  
- **Notice of Dispute**: A formal document sent to the other party to initiate arbitration, requiring specific details about the claim.  
- **Arbitration Procedures**: Rules governing how claims are consolidated, awarded relief, and enforced, with a 60-day resolution window.  
- **Enforceability**: The agreement is enforceable under U.S. law, limiting relief to individual claims and preventing collective actions.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Notice of Dispute**: Requires a written notice (via certified mail) to Offchain Labs, specifying the claim’s nature and relief sought.  
- **Resolution Window**: Parties must resolve disputes within 60 calendar days of receiving the notice; failure to do so triggers arbitration.  
- **Arbitration Rules**: The arbitrator may not consolidate claims, limit relief to individual parties, and enforce the agreement’s terms.  
- **Legal Framework**: Governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, ensuring compliance with U.S. law.

- Pre-Arbitration Dispute ResolutionOffchain Labs is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customers satisfaction by emailing customer support at info@offchainlabs.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (Notice). The Notice to Offchain Labs should be sent to 252 Nassau Street, Floor 2, Princeton, New Jersey 08542 (Notice Address). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Offchain Labs and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Offchain Labs may commence an arbitration proceeding.
