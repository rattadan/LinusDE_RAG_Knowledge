## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 87

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

The benefit of a good
repositioning strategy differs depending on the fleet size, the 𝐷𝑆𝑅,
and the maximum waiting time. Figs. 5 and 6 show the service rates
and the waiting times for different fleet sizes and different problem
settings. For each setting and fleet size, the blank part indicates the
value without repositioning (the nearest parking lot strategy), and the

Fig. 6. Waiting times of nearest repositioning (blank) and best repositioning strategy
(striped) in different settings with different fleet sizes. striped part indicates the value with the best repositioning for this
setting. The difference between these values demonstrates the benefit
of repositioning. It can be observed that repositioning improves the
service rate more for small fleets than for bigger fleets. The waiting
time reduction induced by the repositioning, however, gets bigger
with increasing fleet size, especially regarding relative improvement.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk describes a specific aspect of optimizing ride-hailing system operations using machine learning techniques.

**Technical Details/Parameters:**

- **𝐷𝑆𝑅 (Disruption Time):** The technical parameter being analyzed is 𝐷𝑆𝑅, which represents the disruption time or waiting time for different fleet sizes and problem settings.
- **Waiting Times:** Waiting times for nearest repositioning strategy and best repositioning strategy are mentioned, with 𝜇𝑒𝋛𝑠𝑎𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖𝑠 being the unit of measurement (e.g., time in hours or minutes).

**Connection to surrounding context:**

- The chunk builds upon the research summary provided earlier, highlighting the importance of fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing in optimizing shared autonomous ride-hailing system operations.
- It focuses specifically on the concept of "repositioning strategy," which involves adjusting the placement of vehicles to optimize service rates and reduce waiting times.

**Requirements/Conditions:**

- The analysis assumes a scenario where the ride-hailing system has multiple fleets with varying sizes, disrupting times (𝐷𝑆𝑅), and different problem settings.
- To understand the benefit of repositioning strategy, the chunk requires data or simulation results that compare service rates and waiting times for different fleet sizes and problem settings under various repositioning strategies.
