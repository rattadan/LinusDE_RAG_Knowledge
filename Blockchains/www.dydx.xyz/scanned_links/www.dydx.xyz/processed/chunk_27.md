### Document Overview  
The content discusses Ethereum's use of smart contracts, its transition from PoW to PoS, and its distinction from Bitcoin through features like decentralized finance (DeFi) and utility tokens (Ether).  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing agreements on blockchain that automate processes (e.g., loan disbursement in Aave).  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Validators lock assets to confirm transactions, reducing energy consumption compared to PoW.  
- **Validators**: Miners in PoS networks who secure the blockchain and earn rewards.  
- **Ether (ETH)**: Utility token for transaction fees and dApp access in the Ethereum ecosystem.  
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Financial applications on blockchain that enable peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.  
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: PoW (Proof-of-Work) vs. PoS (Proof-of-Stake) for securing blockchains.  

### Implementation Details  
- **PoS Transition**: Ethereum shifted from PoW to PoS in 2022, requiring validators to lock at least 32 ETH.  
- **Smart Contract Examples**: Automated loan disbursement (e.g., Aave) and collateral monitoring.  
- **Validator Requirements**: Minimum 32 ETH stake to join the Ethereum network.  
- **Ether Use**: Paid for transaction fees and access to DeFi dApps.  

### Related Topics  
- **Blockchain Consensus**: Comparison of PoW and PoS in Ethereum vs. Bitcoin.  
- **DeFi Applications**: Role of smart contracts in decentralized finance.  
- **Ethereum Protocol Features**: Transition to PoS and its implications for scalability and energy efficiency.

with the help of âsmart contracts.â

Smart contracts are programs that execute commands without intermediaries. For example, a smart contract could detect when a user deposits collateral into a decentralized crypto lending app like Aave. In this case, smart contracts will automatically send the desired loan to the borrowerâs cryptocurrency wallet and monitor the value of the collateral.

Computer programmer Vitalik Buterin introduced Ethereum in 2013 and launched the blockchain two years later. Although Ethereum initially used a PoW consensus mechanism, the development team transitioned to a âProof-of-Stakeâ (PoS) network in 2022. PoS networks make validators lock crypto on the blockchain to confirm transactions and receive rewards. To join the Ethereum blockchain, validators must lock at least 32 ETH.

Dozens of features distinguish Ethereum from Bitcoin, but four crucial components put these cryptocurrencies in separate categories. Here are the key distinctions:

Although Bitcoinâs revolutionary infrastructure inspired Ethereumâs team, ETH developers didnât view Ethereum as a âbetter BTC.â Instead, the Ethereum protocol uses smart contracts to decentralize Web-based services. The Ether cryptocurrency has utility within the Ethereum ecosystem to pay for on-chain transaction fees and access dApps in fields such as decentralized finance (DeFi), play-to-earn gaming, and decentralized social media.

By contrast, Satoshi Nakamoto wanted Bitcoin to become a real-world payment network. Bitcoin supporters believe BTC is a viable alternative to fiat currencies and a potential global reserve currency. While itâs possible to build dApps on top of Bitcoin, Nakamotoâs goal was to use blockchain technology to create a new version of digital cash.Â

Between 2015 and 2022, Ethereum and Bitcoin used the same PoW consensus algorithm to confirm transactions.
