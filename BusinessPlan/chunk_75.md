## Chunk 75

**Original Text:**

The nRide smart-contracts are compatible with any
CosmWasm enabled blockchain. To mitigate the risk of a
service outage or degraded performance on Juno, nRide will
deploy backup smart-contracts on other trusted chains such as
Archway and TGrade. Switching from one to the other
requires pushing a configuration change to the proxy service
mentioned in the Work Packages section and can be
automated to happen in a matter of seconds to minimize user
disruption. Critical bugs in smart-contracts: A bug/error in a
smart-contract can lead to loss of user tokens, or service
interruption. The escrow smart-contract, which is
implemented as a finite state machine, locks/unlocks user
funds based on user input and timeouts.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that nRide's Smart Contracts are designed to be compatible with any CosmWasm-enabled blockchain, including Juno, Archway, and TGrade. This suggests that they can be deployed across multiple chains without significant modifications.

To mitigate the risk of a service outage or degraded performance on Juno, nRide plans to deploy backup smart-contracts on other trusted chains like Archway and TGrade. This ensures that users are not affected in case of a failure on Juno.

However, switching between these backup contracts requires pushing a configuration change to the proxy service. This can be automated to minimize user disruption, which is an important consideration for any distributed system.

It's also worth noting that there are critical bugs in nRide's smart-contracts, including:

1. Loss of user tokens due to a bug or error.
2. Service interruption caused by a bug or error.

These issues highlight the importance of having robust and reliable Smart Contracts that can be built on top of multiple chains without significant modifications.
