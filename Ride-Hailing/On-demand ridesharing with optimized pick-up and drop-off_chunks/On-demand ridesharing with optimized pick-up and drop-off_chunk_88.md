**Original Text:**

8 shows the spatial distribution of total delay, by calculating for each node the average corresponding to the requests departing
(Fig. 8 left) or arriving (Fig. 8 right) there. Values are normalized and truncated to the 40th percentile. It is apparent that both images
are clearer at the center of the network (specially the left one). This means that requests departing from the most demanded zone
present, in general, the highest total delay, which remains true (although softened) for the trips that arrive there. Intuitively, requests
that depart or arrive in the center have a higher chance of sharing (which requires detours), but with requests that are nearby (which
shortens such detours). Figs. 8 reveal that the first effect dominates. The respective colorbar (also used in the following Figures) is
included as well. Fig. 9 shows the analogous measures regarding waiting time, truncated to the second tercile.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining a technical detail related to ridesharing systems, specifically how delays are calculated and visualized in the context of meeting points.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Technical details:** The text explains that delays in ridesharing systems are calculated by analyzing the spatial distribution of requests departing from or arriving at nodes (points on a network) within the system.
2. **Process:** The authors use spatial analysis techniques to determine the average delay for each node, normalizing and truncating values to the 40th percentile. This is done by calculating the total delay for each requesting location (departure or arrival) compared to all other nodes in the same category (e.g., departures from the most demanded zone).
3. **Visualization:** The text explains that the resulting visualizations, such as Figures 8 and 9, show how delays vary across different node locations. Specifically:
   - Figure 8 shows the total delay distribution for each node based on requests departing from or arriving at those nodes.
   - Figure 9 shows the analogous measure regarding waiting time, again normalized to the second tercile.

The context that this chunk builds upon is the surrounding discussion of rebalancing strategies, modeling and mathematical frameworks, optimization heuristics, simulation and service design, flexible transport services, ride-sharing systems with meeting points, vehicle rebalancing for mobility-on-demand systems, flex-route services and ride-sharing, reinforcement learning approaches, and benefits of meeting points in ride-sharing systems.

This chunk is specifically connecting to the surrounding context by:

* Providing technical details on how delays are calculated
* Visualizing the results using spatial analysis techniques
* Explaining the significance of meeting points in improving efficiency and user satisfaction

To address specific requirements or conditions, this text might be useful in various scenarios:

* Researchers and practitioners working on ridesharing systems can use this information to optimize their models and simulations.
* Policy-makers and urban planners interested in developing more efficient transportation networks can learn from the findings on how meeting points affect delay distributions.

Overall, this chunk is providing technical details and insights into a complex problem-solving process related to ride-sharing systems.
