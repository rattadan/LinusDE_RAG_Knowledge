**Original Text:**

Recognizing the significance of the number of passengers (xPax ), the vehicle type (xSpr ) and the
infrastructural conditions at the stop location (xVir ) as relevant independent variables in bus
dwell time modeling (Rashidi, Ataeian, and Ranjitkar 2023). we incorporated them into our
model approach. Further, based on observations made during measurements, we included,
variables to count for luggage storage (xBag ), elderly passengers (xSen ) and late arrivals of
passengers (xWait ). To minimize multicollinearity, we primarily utilized dummy variables to
represent categorical data, such as vehicle type (Sprinter vs. V-Class) and stop location type
(virtual stop vs. PT bus station). For passenger age, we followed the categorization established by Kersting, Kallbach, and Schl√ºter (2021) and classified seniors or elderly people as
those aged 60 years or older.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining how to model and analyze various independent variables that affect bus dwell time, specifically recognizing relevant variables such as:

- Number of passengers (xPax )
- Vehicle type (xSpr ), which can be Sprinter or V-Class
- Infrastructure conditions at the stop location (xVir )
- Variables related to luggage storage, elderly passengers (xBag ), and late arrivals of passengers (xWait )

This context is connected to the surrounding research on ride-pooling services, specifically focusing on urban transport systems and sustainability. The use of these variables in bus dwell time modeling suggests a holistic approach to understanding how various factors impact ridership patterns.

The chunk builds upon the surrounding context by introducing technical details such as:

- Incorporating independent variables into a model approach
- Utilizing dummy variables to represent categorical data (e.g., vehicle type, stop location type)
- Using classification established in Kersting et al. (2021) for passenger age

The current text chunk also addresses specific requirements and conditions mentioned:

- The need for robust modeling approaches that account for various independent variables affecting bus dwell time
- The importance of minimizing multicollinearity to ensure accurate results
