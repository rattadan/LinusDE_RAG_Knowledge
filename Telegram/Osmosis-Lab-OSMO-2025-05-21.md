## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary of the provided chat messages, focusing on key points and decisions. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what's important.

Starting from the earliest message, BasementNodes says "Get integrated if not already" on May 21st at 20:24. That seems like a recommendation to integrate something, maybe a project or protocol. Then, the next day at 13:58, jasbanza asks for an alternative method for IBC, which is inter-blockchain communication. They might be looking for solutions because there's an issue with the current IBC setup. 

Osmosis_statbot responds at 13:57, providing a support link. So maybe they're directing users to official support for help. Then, user_5921741683 at 21:32 mentions Portal Bridge removing Cosmos chain support, and Solana's wormhole (sol.wh) being stuck. This is a problem because users can't withdraw their funds. 

mikebarb responds at 21:35:19 asking if there's been an official announcement. Then another message from mikebarb at 21:35:46 says they saw someone from Terra talking but nothing concrete. So the lack of official info is a concern. 

Profesija posts a link to a Wormhole blog update about supported networks. Then at 21:42:27, they say the Portal isn't needed because no one uses it. That's a decision point‚Äîmaybe to discontinue or not rely on Portal. At 21:43:20, they say "And it is really bad," which could refer to the situation or the Portal's state. Then at 21:43:54, they mention Gud for arbs, which I'm not sure about. Maybe a typo or acronym. 

Jeremy Parish at 22:22:36 says alternative variants are being investigated in addition to previous efforts. So the team is looking into other solutions beyond what's already been tried. 

Putting this together: The main issue is Portal Bridge dropping Cosmos support, causing stuck funds on Solana's wormhole. Users are asking what to do. There's no official announcement yet, but some info from Terra. The community is considering

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this chat text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key points are.

Starting with the first message from jeremyparish: "In addition the previous efforts mentioned, alternative variants are being investigated." The main idea here seems to be about exploring alternative variants, maybe related to some project or technology they're discussing. 

Then profesija says, "Gud for arbs and only that." and "And it is really bad." These are a bit cryptic. "Arbs" might be short for arbitrage, which is a trading strategy. So maybe they're commenting on a situation where something is good only for arbitrage opportunities but bad otherwise. 

Next, profesija mentions, "You need to realize we don't need portal. No one was using it." Portal here likely refers to the Portal Bridge, a cross-chain bridge. The user is criticizing its necessity because of low usage.

mikebarb asks, "Who is that though lol" which might be referring to someone mentioned earlier, but since there's no context, maybe not a main topic. Then they mention someone from Terra talking about something without concrete details. Terra is a blockchain platform, so maybe discussions around Terra's involvement in cross-chain solutions.

Another message from mikebarb: "Has there been an official announcement given?" indicates uncertainty about official updates. 

user_5921741683 talks about Portal Bridge removing support for Cosmos chains, leading to stuck Solana Wormhole (sol.wh) tokens that can't be withdrawn. This is a critical issue about cross-chain bridge functionality and user funds.

BasementNodes says, "Get integrated if not already," which could be advising to integrate with a network or protocol. 

jasbanza asks for an alternative IBC method for users. IBC is the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, so they're seeking alternatives to IBC for cross-chain transactions. 

The statbot from Osmosis provides a support link, which is about support resources.

Putting this all together, the main topics are: cross-chain bridges (like Portal Bridge, Wormhole), IBC alternatives, support resources (Osmosis support site), stuck funds/sol.wh withdrawal issues, blockchain network integration (Cosmos chains, Terra), arbitrage opportunities, and official announcements.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. 

Starting with the first one: "jeremyparish at 2025-05-21T22:22:36+00:00: In addition the previous efforts mentioned, alternative variants are being investigated." The key words here are "alternative variants are being investigated." That sounds like they're exploring options, which is a proactive step. Maybe positive? Or neutral since it's just investigating.

Next, "profesija at 2025-05-21T21:43:54+00:00: Gud for arbs and only that." "Gud" is a typo for "good," but the phrase "and only that" suggests it's not entirely positive. Maybe neutral or slightly positive but limited.

Then, "profesija at 2025-05-21T21:43:20+00:00: And it is really bad." Straightforward negative. Clear and direct.

"profesija at 2025-05-21T21:42:27+00:00: You need to realize we don't need portal. No one was using it." The user is dismissing the portal, saying no one used it. Negative sentiment here as well, critical of the portal.

"mikebarb at 2025-05-21T21:40:14+00:00: Who is that though lol" This seems neutral. It's a question with a casual tone, no clear positive or negative.

"profesija at 2025-05-21T21:35:53+00:00: https://wormhole.com/blog/updates-to-wormholes-supported-networks" Just a link, no text. Neutral because there's no sentiment expressed.

"mikebarb at 2025-05-21T21:35:46+00:00: I saw someone from terra talking about it but nothing concrete" Neutral. The user is reporting an observation without strong feelings.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I'll read through each message to understand the context.

Starting from the top, jeremyparish mentions that alternative variants are being investigated in addition to previous efforts. So that's an action item: investigating alternative variants. 

Then there's profesija saying "Gud for arbs and only that." and "And it is really bad." Not sure if those are action items, maybe just opinions. Next, profesija says, "You need to realize we don't need portal. No one was using it." That sounds like a decision to not use the portal anymore, so a decision item there.

mikebarb asks, "Who is that though lol" ‚Äì probably just a question, not an action. Then profesija shares a link to a Wormhole blog post. That might be a reference but not an action item. Mikebarb mentions someone from Terra talking about it but nothing concrete. Again, not an action. Another message from mikebarb asking if there's been an official announcement. That's a question, not an action.

user_5921741683 talks about Portal Bridge removing support for Cosmos chains and Sol.WH being stuck. They're asking what to do, so maybe that's a next step needing a solution. BasementNodes says, "Get integrated if not already" ‚Äì that's a clear action item to integrate something.

jasbanza asks, "do you have an alternative method for IBC that I can give users?" which implies they need an alternative method, so that's a next step or action item. Osmosis_statbot provides a support link, which is a reference but maybe the action is to visit the support site.

Putting this together, the main action items are the investigation into alternatives, integrating if not done, and finding an alternative IBC method. Decisions include discontinuing the portal. Next steps might involve checking for official announcements, addressing the stuck Sol.WH issue, and seeking support via the provided link. I need to list these clearly without including opinions or questions unless they imply an action.

Here are the extracted **action items, decisions, and next steps** from the text:
