## Chunk 27

**Original Text:**

Once confirmed usable, you must add the CW20 token’s metadata to a registry we support indexing from. The easiest one is likely the Cosmos Chain Registry, you can check out an example of a CW20 token entry here in Archway’s assetlist.json. Once the PR is merged into a registry, our indexing will add it to the API on our next indexing run (hourly). Support Requirements
Swap Venue Requirements
This document covers what Skip Go API requires of DEXes to support them as potential swapping venues within the API’s cross-chain DEX aggregation functionality. At the end, the document provides instructions for helping the Skip team add your DEX to the API as a swapping venue

From there, indexing will occur regularly (hourly), and once the PR (Pull Request) is merged into the registry, it will be automatically added to the Skip Go API.

The key requirements for DEXs to become swapping venues on the Skip Go API are:

1. Swap Venue Requirements
2. Background

Specifically, the document mentions that DEXes need to provide their metadata and support being indexed by the Cosmos Chain Registry in order to become a swapping venue on the Skip Go API.

Additionally, the document provides instructions for the Skip team on how to add their DEX to the API as a swapping venue:

* Instructions will be provided once the PR is merged into the registry.
