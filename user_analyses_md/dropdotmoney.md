The tweet outlines benefits of linking these addresses and provides instructions on how to do it.

2. Language style and tone:
The language style is formal yet accessible, with clear instructions. The tone is informative, directive, and somewhat urgent. The use of "Important" at the beginning suggests this is critical information that users need to act on. The tweet uses emojis and bullet points to organize information in a digestible format.
