I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

Using uniformly distributed request locations slightly increases the
service rate in most of the settings. However, for the very short maximum waiting time of the ùê∑ùëÜùëÖ = 40 setting, the service rate of the
best strategy decreases by almost 20%. This is most likely caused by
the removal of hotspots with many requests in a very small area that
previously existed in the city center. Additionally, in most of the settings, the benefit of repositioning compared to no repositioning (here:
the nearest parking lot strategy) decreases slightly. Please keep in mind
that this is mostly due to the fact that no repositioning is particularly
bad in situations with asymmetric travel patterns, as described in Section 4. Removing these asymmetries by sampling uniformly distributed
origin and destination locations reduces the impact of sophisticated
repositioning strategies.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section discusses two key aspects related to dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems:

1. **Technical details:** The authors discuss a simulation study (Bischoff & Maciejewski, 2016; Ho et al., 2018) that demonstrates the impact of uniformly distributed request locations on service rates in various settings. Specifically, they show how decreasing the maximum waiting time from ùê∑ùëÜùëÖ = 40 seconds to 20% by removing hotspots with many requests results in a significant decrease in service rate.

2. **Contextual connection and building upon:** This section builds upon the surrounding context of simulation studies, which focus on optimizing ride-hailing services through various strategies such as demand forecasting, rebalancing, and vehicle assignment. The current study expands on these topics by investigating how uniformly distributed request locations affect performance in specific settings.

3. **Specific requirements and conditions:** None are mentioned specifically in this section. However, the context implies that:

- A dynamic dispatch strategy was evaluated.
- Real-time management is considered essential for optimizing ride-hailing services.
- The impact of uniform distribution on service rates needs to be understood in various scenarios (e.g., different maximum waiting times).
- Asymmetrical travel patterns can affect the effectiveness of repositioning strategies.

Overall, this section aims to provide insight into how uniformly distributed request locations might influence performance in dynamic dispatch and real-time management contexts.
