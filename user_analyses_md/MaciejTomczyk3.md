1. Main topics/themes discussed:
From the tweets provided, I can identify several main topics:
- Bitcoin ($BTC) and market analysis (price, Fear & Greed Index)
- Google Trends interest in Bitcoin
- Solana blockchain
- Crypto community engagement ("KryptoEkipa")
- Web3 projects (Step Finance)
- Weekly updates ("#Bitcoin czwartek" - Bitcoin Thursday)

2. Language style and tone:
The language style appears to be:

- Polish language with emojis and symbols mixed in
- Uses Polish greetings ("Dzie≈Ñ Dobry") mixed with English crypto terminology
