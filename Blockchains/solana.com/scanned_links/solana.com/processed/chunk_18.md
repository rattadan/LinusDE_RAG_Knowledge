## Source Context
*From: https://solana.com/*

### Document Overview  
The content describes the return data from Solana transactions, including program instructions, account indices, and data structures, with details on how data is encoded and structured for transaction verification.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Transaction Return Data**: A structure containing program instructions, account indices, and data for verified transactions.  
- **Program Instructions**: Ordered lists of inner instructions executed during a transaction, with details like `programId`, `accounts`, and `data`.  
- **Encoding Formats**: Base-58 and base-64 encoding for data transmission, ensuring compatibility and security.  
- **Compute Units**: A 64-bit unsigned integer tracking computational resources consumed by transactions.  
- **Transaction Versioning**: Different versions (e.g., "legacy") and their implications for compatibility and security.  
- **Account Indices**: Arrays of indices into `message.accountKeys` to specify which accounts participate in a transaction.  
- **Token Balances**: Parameters like `mint`, `owner`, and `accountIndex` for managing token balances in Solana.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Data Encoding**: `data` is encoded as base-64, while `programId` is base-58 encoded.  
- **Data Structures**:  
  - `programId`: Base-58 encoded Pubkey (e.g., `Qm...`).  
  - `accounts`: Arrays of indices into `message.accountKeys` to specify which accounts are involved.  
  - `instructions`: Arrays of objects with `programIdIndex`, `data`, and `computeUnitsConsumed`.  
  - `signatures`: Arrays of strings representing transaction signatures.  
- **Technical Specifications**:  
  - `computeUnitsConsumed` is a 64-bit unsigned integer (`u64`).  
  - `version` can be `"legacy"`, a number, or undefined.  
  - `index` is a numerical value indicating the transaction instruction's position.  
- **Implementation Notes**:  
  - Base-58 and base-64 encoding ensures data integrity and compatibility.  
  - `accounts` and `programIdIndex` are critical for determining which accounts participate in a transaction.  

### Related Topics  
- **Solana Transaction Messages**: The `message` structure includes `accountKeys`, `instructions`, and `data` for program execution.  
- **Token Balances**: Parameters like `mint`, `owner`, and `accountIndex` are tied to the `accounts` array in transaction messages.  
- **Program Execution**: Details about `programIdIndex` and `instructions` are part of the broader ecosystem of Solana's programmatic operations.  
- **Data Transmission**: Base-58 and base-64 encoding are standard practices for Solana's data serialization and transmission.

<object|undefined>- the most-recent return data generated by an
instruction in the transaction, with the following fields:programId: <string>- the program that generated the return data, as
base-58 encoded Pubkeydata: <[string, encoding]>- the return data itself, as base-64 encoded
binary data
- programId: <string>- the program that generated the return data, as
base-58 encoded Pubkey
- data: <[string, encoding]>- the return data itself, as base-64 encoded
binary data
- computeUnitsConsumed: <u64|undefined>- number ofcompute unitsconsumed by the transaction
- version: <"legacy"|number|undefined>- Transaction version. Undefined ifmaxSupportedTransactionVersionis not set in request params.
- signatures: <array>- present if "signatures" are requested for transaction
details; an array of signatures strings, corresponding to the transaction
order in the block
- index: number- Index of the transaction instruction from which the inner
instruction(s) originated
- instructions: <array[object]>- Ordered list of inner program instructions
that were invoked during a single transaction instruction.programIdIndex: <number>- Index into themessage.accountKeysarray
indicating the program account that executes this instruction.accounts: <array[number]>- List of ordered indices into themessage.accountKeysarray indicating which accounts to pass to the
program.data: <string>- The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.
- programIdIndex: <number>- Index into themessage.accountKeysarray
indicating the program account that executes this instruction.
- accounts: <array[number]>- List of ordered indices into themessage.accountKeysarray indicating which accounts to pass to the
program.
- data: <string>- The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.
- accountIndex: <number>- Index of the account in which the token balance is
provided for.
