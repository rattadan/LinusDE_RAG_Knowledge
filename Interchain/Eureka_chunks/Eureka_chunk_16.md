## Eureka - Chunk 16

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

​
Background
New tokens often want Skip Go API to add support for transferring their token to other chains because the API powers cross-chain swaps + transfers in all the major cosmos wallets (Leap, Keplr, IBC Wallet, Metamask Snap) and cross-chain DEX aggregation for many popular defi aggregator and dapp frontends (e.g. Stargaze). As a result, being added to the Skip Go API instantly offers distribution across the interchain for a new token
This document covers the basic requirements tokens must satisfy and steps their contributors must complete in order for Skip Go API to support transferring them throughout the interchain
Guide assumes using IBC for interop

This guide assumes you’re using IBC to transfer your token between chains. The Skip Go API supports other bridges and interop protocols in addition to IBC, including Hyperlane, CCTP, and Axelar. If you’re using one of these, please get in contact with us on our Discord. and we will help guide you through it to the extent we can.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, particularly in the context of the Skip Go API.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The document mentions three main protocols that are prone to failures:
	+ Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)
	+ Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)
	+ Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)
* It also highlights specific potential issues associated with each protocol, such as timeouts or slippage in IBC, slow relaying in Axelar, and the risk of funds being inaccessible on a chain due to service outages in CCTP.

**Context Connection:**

* The text assumes that the reader is already familiar with the basics of cross-chain asset transfer protocols.
* It provides additional insights into each protocol's failure points and how they can be mitigated through user education, risk management, and developer best practices.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

* Users are expected to monitor transactions for potential delays or failures. (Note: This is not explicitly stated in the provided text chunk, but it is implied as a requirement for users to take proactive steps to mitigate risks.)
* Developers must implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in their cross-chain applications. (Again, this is not explicitly stated in the provided text chunk, but it is mentioned as one of the recommendations for improving developer practices.)
