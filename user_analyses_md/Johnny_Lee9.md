Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of the tweets from Johnny_Lee9. They need five keywords/tags for postprocessing. First, I need to analyze the tweets to identify the main topics.

Looking at the tweets, the main themes seem to be privacy in Web3, specifically Secret Network. The user is discussing privacy features like privacy by design, decentralized identity, and the importance of privacy in financial transactions. There's also mention of the ticker $SCRT and community engagement through a Dev Community Call. 

The language style is assertive and technical, using terms like "BUIDL," "privacy by design," and "decentralized identity." The tone is confident, emphasizing the importance of privacy and the need for a decentralized infrastructure. The key characteristics of communication are technical jargon, strong advocacy for privacy, and engagement with the community.

The ecosystem here is Secret Network, as the tweets are about their features and community.
