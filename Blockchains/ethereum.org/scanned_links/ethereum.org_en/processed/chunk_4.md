### Document Overview  
This document explains stablecoins, their types, usage, and methods to acquire them, with focus on Ethereum ecosystem tools and platforms.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Stablecoins**: Digital money designed to maintain stable value relative to fiat currencies (e.g., USD).  
- **Types**:  
  - **Fiat-backed**: Backed by real-world assets (e.g., USD, EUR).  
  - **Crypto-backed**: Backed by cryptocurrencies (e.g., Dai, USDC).  
  - **Precious metals**: Backed by physical assets (e.g., gold, silver).  
  - **Algorithmic**: Automated supply adjustments (e.g., Celsius, TerraUSD).  
- **Use cases**:  
  - **Saving**: Interest-earning dApps (Aave, Compound).  
  - **Trading**: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for swaps (e.g., Dai, USDC).  
  - **Borrowing**: Collateral-based loans (e.g., Aave, Summer.fi).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Stablecoin acquisition**:  
  - **Swap**: Trade tokens for stablecoins on DEXs (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap).  
  - **Buy**: Direct purchases via wallets (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).  
  - **Earn**: Earn stablecoins through staking, liquidity provision, or NFTs.  
- **Platforms**:  
  - **Aave**: DeFi lending platform for stablecoin borrowing.  
  - **Compound**: Automated staking for interest-earning tokens.  
  - **Summer.fi**: DeFi lending and borrowing platform.  
- **Technical features**:  
  - **Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**: Enable token swaps without intermediaries.  
  - **Collateral**: Stablecoins as collateral for loans (e.g., Dai, USDC).
