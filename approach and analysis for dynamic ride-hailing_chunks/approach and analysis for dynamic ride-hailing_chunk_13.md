**Original Text:**

With these contributions, we aim to advance the study of ridehailing problems by helping researchers as well as practitioners to find
the most suitable approach for their specific problem settings, thus
allowing easier further development of the existing approaches as well
as the implementation of more efficient ride-hailing services in practice. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2,
related literature is presented. In addition, we point out the different
problem characteristics considered in the literature and classify the papers accordingly. In Section 3, the specific problem under consideration
is introduced and formulated. Section 4 describes in detail the relevant
assignment approaches and their features considered in our study. In
Section 5, we present the benchmark approaches for repositioning as
well as our own repositioning strategy. The results of the experimental
study are addressed and discussed in Section 6.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is providing technical details on dynamic dispatch strategies, specifically real-time management in ride-hailing systems.

1. **Technical Details:**
   - Dynamic dispatch refers to the process of assigning vehicles to passengers based on their demand for transportation in real-time.
   - Repositioning involves adjusting the assignment of vehicles to match changing demand patterns or vehicle availability.
   - Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) is a method used to solve complex optimization problems, which can be applied to repositioning strategies.

2. **Context Connection:**
   This section connects to the broader topic by introducing key references on ride-hailing systems and their challenges in real-time management. It highlights that researchers are working to advance the field by exploring various approaches for dynamic dispatch and repositioning.
   - The context also includes a detailed outline of the current state of research, which is structured into sections (2, 3, 4, 5) and includes references on relevant topics.

3. **Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**
   This section does not explicitly mention any specific technical requirements or constraints. However, it implies that dynamic dispatch strategies should be optimized for real-time management in ride-hailing systems, where:
   - Vehicle availability is a limiting factor.
   - Demand patterns are changing frequently.
   - The need to balance vehicle utilization and driver safety is crucial.

By understanding these details, the reader can better appreciate the complexity of ride-hailing problem settings and the potential challenges researchers face when developing dynamic dispatch strategies.
