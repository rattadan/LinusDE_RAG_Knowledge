**Original Text:**

We also compared stop times across different weekdays
and observation dates. In both cases, we did not find any statistically significant differences. Further determinant-specific evaluations of the stop time data are summarised in
Table 3 and are visualised in Figure 4. The empirical data shows a large dispersion of measured stop times. The presence of outliers in the diagram (Figure 4) highlights that some
stops can take significantly longer than typical (median) durations for certain determinants. Most stops were observed during the evening hours (18:00 - 02:00), and the corresponding statistics closely mirrored the overall stop time evaluation. The two vehicle types do
not show any discrepancy considering stop times. However, PUDO events tend to last
longer at PT bus stops compared to virtual stops. A notable variation of around 38 s in the
75th percentile indicates shorter stops at virtual stops with higher probabilities.
