h3: Tell us a little about the app you are building on Base?

h3: "BLOCKLORDS is a medieval grand strategy game with a player-driven onchain economy, where you can start as a farmer, rise to a warrior, or even rule as a king. It's all about choice, strategy, and progression. The game is live on the Epic Games Store, making it accessible to a broad audience. We also launched BLOCKLORDS Dynasty, a mobile-first companion game built specifically for Base with onchain logic. Last year, Dynasty brought 1.8 million unique wallets to Base, showing that players are ready for deeper blockchain integrationswhen done right."

h3: "Take risks. Push the limits when designing smart contractsdon't just follow what's been done before. The best innovations come from experimenting."
