## Eureka - Chunk 30

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Some don’t support memos, which are required for post-transfer contract calls and multi-hop transfers)
On transfer failure, converter contracts just return assets to sender. That means if one of our contracts attempts to send tokens on your behalf unsuccessfully, it will receive the tokens. We can’t atomically send them to you. ​
How do CW20 tokens compare to “native” (aka bank module) tokens? “Native” tokens are tokens where minting, burning, balances, and transfer functionality are managed by the bank module, instead of by contracts. Unlike CW20s, native tokens are directly compatible with ICS20 and IBC modules. One can send a native token to another chain over a transfer channel just using a MsgTransfer — no conversion contracts or anything of the sort required. The downside of native tokens is that they’re permissioned and deeply ingrained into the chain’s state machine. As a result, issuing a new native token requires a chain upgrade.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides detailed information on potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, including:

1. Technical details: The use of packet tracking and live relayer/client status to identify stuck packets early.
2. Connection to the surrounding context:
- It builds upon the discussion of potential failures in IBC, Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast protocols.
3. Requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:
- The need for robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

The specific technical details described in this chunk include:

- Packet tracking and live relayer/client status
- Prioritization of multi-hop relaying to improve transaction success rates

This text chunk also connects the surrounding context by discussing other protocols (IBC, Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol, Hyperlane, Go Fast) that were mentioned earlier. Additionally, it provides recommendations for developers and users on how to prepare for potential failures in cross-chain asset transfers.

Overall, this chunk is providing a detailed analysis of technical aspects related to cross-chain asset transfer protocols, including the need for robust error handling and fallback mechanisms, as well as the importance of implementing reliable and efficient protocols to mitigate potential failures.
