## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and figure out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on decisions and important info.

Starting from the top, jackieee033 says to check the inbox. That's probably a prompt for someone to look at direct messages, so maybe note that as a reminder. Then there's a link from osmosis_news, but without the content of the link, I can't say much except that it's a shared link, maybe for a related update.

mikebarb and davidjgoosey are thanking each other. mikebarb mentions not sure if someone is the best bet for marketing, so that's a point about team roles. davidjgoosey says he's handling info and will update via DMs, so that's an action item.

celestiapunks asks for help with a snapshot of liquidity providers and wants to connect with the team. mikebarb suggests DMing davidjgoosey directly. So the main points here are the request for assistance, the referral to davidjgoosey, and the collaboration intent.

osmosis_statbot provides a support link, which is standard. zicha110001 mentions a live proposal, WBTC.OSMO whitelisting on Terra's alliance, congratulations, and expects increased demand. That's a major update. The last message talks about the asset being heavily traded on Luna Terra network soon.

Putting it all together: The key decisions are the whitelisting of WBTC.OSMO on Terra Liquidity Alliance, the collaboration request from Celestia Punks to Osmosis team, directing requests to Davidjgoosey, and the expectation of higher demand. Also, the support link and reminder to check DMs. Need to make sure it's concise, so avoid redundant info. Check if all important updates are covered without extra details.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided chat messages as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to read through each message and identify the key points. Let's go line by line.

Starting with jackieee033's message: "please check inbox" ‚Äì that's a simple request, maybe about communication or notifications. Not sure if that's a main topic yet, but I'll note it as a possible one.

Next, osmosis_news shares a link. The link is to a Twitter status. Since the user is asking for topics, the link itself might not be a topic, but maybe the content of the tweet? But since it's not provided, perhaps the mention of "osmosis_news" and the link is just a reference. Maybe the topic here is related to Osmosis news or announcements.

Then there's mikebarb saying "You got it! Thanks as well" ‚Äì this seems like a positive acknowledgment, maybe part of a conversation about assistance or collaboration.

davidjgoosey's message: "All good, you can generally send most requests my way unless..." This indicates someone offering support, handling requests. Maybe topics around support, assistance, or team collaboration.

Another davidjgoosey message: "I have someone working on pulling this info..." So they're coordinating information gathering, possibly related to a specific request. The mention of "snapshot of Osmosis liquidity providers" earlier from celestiapunks might tie into this. That seems like a key topic: liquidity providers snapshot.

celestiapunks messages: They mention needing help with a snapshot of Osmosis liquidity providers and wanting to connect with the team. So that's definitely a main topic. Also, the mention of "Terra Liquidity Alliance" and "ErisProtocol" when talking about Wbtc.Osmo asset being whitelisted. That's another topic: whitelisting of assets on Terra Liquidity Alliance.

mikebarb again: Suggesting someone else isn't the best bet for marketing, so maybe there's a topic around marketing coordination or team roles.

osmosis_statbot provides a support link. That's more of a support resource, maybe not a main topic but part of the conversation context.

zicha110001's messages: Congratulating on a proposal going live, mentioning Wbtc.Osmo asset whitelisting, expecting

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. It's a series of chat messages, so I need to go through each one and see if they're positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting from the top, the first message is "please check inbox" from jackieee033. That seems neutral to me. It's a request but not clearly positive or negative. 

Next, there's a link from osmosis_news. Links themselves are neutral unless the context shows emotion, but I don't know what the link is about. Maybe the content of the link could influence sentiment, but since I can't check it, I'll treat it as neutral.

Then, mikebarb says, "You got it! Thanks as well." The exclamation mark and thanks indicate a positive sentiment. They're agreeing and showing gratitude.

davidjgoosey's message: "All good, you can generally send most requests my way..." He's being helpful and appreciative, so that's positive. The emoji üôå adds to the positive tone.

Another davidjgoosey message: "I have someone working on pulling this info..." Again, helpful and proactive, so positive. The smiley face üôÇ reinforces that.

mikebarb's earlier message: "oh, not sure hes the best bet for that. i thought it was regarding marketing." The phrase "not sure" and correcting someone might be slightly negative, but it's more about redirecting. Maybe neutral or slightly negative.

celestiapunks: "Thank you ser, will do" ‚Äì "ser" could be a typo for "sir" or intentional. Thanking someone is positive. The next message from them says they need help taking a snapshot, which is a request but not negative. Neutral or positive? Since they're asking for help, maybe neutral.

mikebarb's message: "I would send a dm to @davidjgoosey directly." Just a suggestion, so neutral.

celestiapunks again: "We‚Äôd love to connect w the teamü´°" ‚Äì the emoji ü´° (saluting) shows respect or eagerness, so positive.

osmosis_statbot's message is a link to support. Neutral, as it's a standard support link.

zicha110001: "Great achievement for team and osmo assets" ‚Äì definitely positive. Words like "great achievement

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and see what's being requested or decided.

Starting from the top, the first message is from jackieee033 asking someone to check their inbox. That seems like an action item because they're prompting another person to do something. Then there's a link from osmosis_news, but it's just a URL without any explicit action mentioned. 

Next, mikebarb says "You got it! Thanks as well." That sounds like a confirmation or acknowledgment, not an action item. Then davidjgoosey mentions handling requests unless someone else is better suited. He's indicating he's available, so maybe that's a decision about who to contact. 

Another message from davidjgoosey says he has someone pulling info and will update via DMs. That's a next step he's taking. Then mikebarb advises against contacting a certain person for a specific task and suggests someone else, which is a decision about resource allocation. 

celestiapunks asks for help taking a snapshot of liquidity providers. That's a clear action item. Mikebarb follows up suggesting a DM to davidjgoosey directly, which is a next step. Celestiapunks also mentions wanting to connect with the team, which might be another action item if it's a request for someone to initiate contact. 

The osmosis_statbot provides a support link, which is more of a reference than an action. The other messages from zicha110001 are announcements about a proposal and congrats, not actions. 

Putting it all together, the main action items are checking the inbox, reaching out to davidjgoosey for the snapshot request, and the team working on pulling that info. Decisions include directing the request to davidjgoosey and noting that certain people might not be the best contact for specific tasks. Next steps involve following up via DMs and connecting with the team. I need to make sure I don't miss any and present them clearly.

Here are the extracted **action items**, **decisions**, and **next steps** from the text:

### **Action Items**  
1. **Check inbox** (requested by `jackieee033`).  
2. **Take a snapshot of Osmosis
