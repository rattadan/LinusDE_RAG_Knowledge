hailing services for contracting needs to meet their demand. Attracting driving talent is often a major
expense for many hailing-platforms as it involves marketing to a broad audience. The OneApp platform

As part of our partnership, OneApp will transfer its existing driver base on-chain to the nRide driver
registry.
