**Original Text:**

Once developer mode is active, at the bottom of the main page you should see “Advanced IBC Transfer”. Click on this then follow the instructions for inputting your token and desired channel ID. Why is this required? Warm starting the channels kicks off Skip’s intelligent routing suggestions for folks bridging to and from your chain. We choose routes between chains that ensure users are always receiving the most desirable version of their chosen token on their destination chain.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

You're referring to the process of setting up an Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) connection in a blockchain network, likely Solana.

The "Advanced IBC Transfer" option is indeed required for several reasons:

1. **Warm starting**: The instructions are part of a warm-starting process, which is necessary to kickstart the channels that enable IBC transfers. This involves setting up the channels between chains, including Skip's routing suggestions.
2. **Channel setup**: The "Advanced IBC Transfer" option allows you to set up your channel with specific settings, such as token input and desired channel ID. This includes specifying the blockchain (in this case, Solana) where the transfer will take place.
3. **Route optimization**: By following these instructions, you're enabling Skip's intelligent routing suggestions to optimize routes between chains for users bridging to or from your chain. This ensures that users receive the most desirable version of their chosen token on their destination chain.

By activating Developer Mode and clicking on the "Advanced IBC Transfer" option, you're taking a crucial step towards setting up a seamless IBC experience across different blockchain networks.
