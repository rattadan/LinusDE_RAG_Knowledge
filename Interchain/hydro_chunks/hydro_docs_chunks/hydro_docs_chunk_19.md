**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

The exact formula is:

Average APR=(∑i∈last round bidstribute valueitotal last round locked atomi)×12\text{Average APR} = \left(\frac{\sum_{\substack{i \in \text{last round bids}}} \text{tribute value}_i}{\text{total last round locked atom}_i}\right) \times 12Average APR=(total last round locked atomi​∑i∈last round bids​​tribute valuei​​)×12

The interface will display APRs based on the last month, the last three months, and the last year. ## PoL APR (Protocol-Owned Liquidity APR)
--------------------------------------

In addition to staking APR and voter APR, PoL APR is another essential component of rewards in Hydro. It represents the yield generated by liquidity deployed into various DeFi protocols through Hydro’s auction system. ### How PoL APR Works
-----------------

When liquidity is deployed, it can generate yield in different ways, such as:

Swap Fees – If the liquidity is provided to a decentralized exchange (DEX), Hydro earns a portion of the trading fees.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the provided text chunk and its context:

**1. Technical details, parameters, or processes described:**

The text chunk provides a mathematical formula for calculating the Average APR in Hydro:

Average APR = (∑i∈last round bids tribute value_i / total last round locked atom_i) × 12

This formula suggests that it's a weighted average of the tributes received by voters in the last round divided by the total amount of ATOM locked in the last round, multiplied by 12 (calendar months).

**2. Connection to surrounding context:**

This formula is likely used in conjunction with other parameters and processes discussed in the context, such as:

* Voting power: Users lock their staked ATOM to gain voting power, which can then be used to vote for bids.
* Tributes: Bidders pay tributes to voters who vote for their bids.
* APR calculation: The forumla calculates the Average APR, which is a component of the rewards in Hydro.

The formula seems to be connected to the Liquidity Deployment process discussed in the surrounding context.

**3. Requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

The text chunk does not explicitly mention specific requirements, conditions, or constraints. However, the formula relies on the following:

* A list of "last round bids"
* A list of "tribute values" associated with each bid
* A "total last round locked atom" value

These values are likely derived from the bidding and voting processes discussed in the surrounding context.
