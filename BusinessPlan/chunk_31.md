## Chunk 31

**Original Text:**

To use
the nRide application, users must possess $NRIDE tokens, which interact with the escrow smart contract. The driver registry and protocol are another key value added for nRide. Ride-hailing applications and
gig-economy app developers can integrate individual components or the complete nRide protocol and
registry into their platform for free, giving them access to a large pool of drivers to hail from. Unbeknownst to end-users that the application is interacting with the registry. We capture value from selling $NRIDE tokens from the DAO and creating an economy around the
$NRIDE token.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're providing information about how the nRide application operates and its technical infrastructure, specifically highlighting the role of escrow smart contracts and the driver registry within it.

To provide a summary while maintaining neutrality:

The nRide application utilizes various components, including an escrow smart contract and a driver registry. These services allow users to interact with these parts of the platform without directly accessing them.

Regarding your mention of capturing value from selling $NRIDE tokens from the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), it's essential to understand that this involves token sales within the context of nRide's ecosystem. Token sales are a common practice in blockchain ecosystems, enabling developers and projects to raise funds for their initiatives.

However, without more specific details on how these token sales are structured and managed, it's challenging to provide a detailed analysis. If you're looking to understand the broader implications or potential risks associated with token sales in nRide's context, I recommend exploring resources such as whitepapers, regulatory guidelines, and industry reports that address token sales and decentralized governance models.
