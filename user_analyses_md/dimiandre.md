Contextualizing this tweet in terms of the author's potential intentions:
This tweet suggests that the author is likely an active crypto investor or enthusiast who is exploring yield opportunities in the Cosmos ecosystem. By mentioning both Umee and Mars, they show familiarity with Cosmos-based DeFi protocols. The fact that they're asking why AKT has "insane" borrow APY suggests they might be evaluating potential investment or lending opportunities, or trying to understand if this represents a genuine opportunity or if there are hidden risks they're not seeing.
