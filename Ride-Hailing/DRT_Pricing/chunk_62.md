## Chunk 62

**Original Text:**

DRT vehicles operating at the capacity limit yields long waiting times for some DRT users
who will eventually prefer a different mode of transportation. Depending on the service area and pricing scheme, the
DRT trip share of all trips in the Berlin area ranges from 0.04% (DRT service area: inner-city Berlin area; Minimum
fare: 3.00 EUR) to 4.9% (DRT service area: entire Berlin area; Minimum fee: 0 EUR). A comparison of the modal
shift effect for the different pricing setups reveals that without a minimum charge, most DRT users come from the
bicycle and walk mode. Without a minimum charge, for both service area setups, only a share of 4% switch from
car to DRT. Charging a minimum fee has a significant effect on the total number of DRT trips as well as the modal
shift: For a higher minimum fee, the number of users switching from bicycle and walk to the DRT mode is
drastically reduced.
