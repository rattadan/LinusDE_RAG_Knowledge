## Chunk 22

**Original Text:**

The selected proposer can then continue with the ride request, while the other drivers return to listening for
requests. The escrow account ensures that the driver is paid for their services, while also providing a layer
of security and protection for both the passenger and the driver. Acceptance {

2.2.6. Confirmation
After a passenger broadcasts an "Acceptance" message to nearby drivers, the driver whose proposal was selected will receive the message and use the provided escrow ID to check the passengerâ€™s deposit in the escrow account. If the deposit is confirmed, the driver must then send their own deposit to the same escrow
account before sending a "Confirmation" message to the passenger.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're describing an online ride-hailing or car-sharing system. Here's a breakdown of each step in more detail:

1. **Selection**: The proposer selects a driver and sends their proposal, which includes information like the proposal ID and escrow account details (ID and possibly a separate account for the passenger).

2. **Driver Response**: The selected driver receives the proposal and responds by sending an "Acceptance" message back to the proposer.

3. **Escrow Confirmation**: When the accepted driver sends their own deposit to the escrow account, they use the same escrow ID sent in the original proposal to verify that the passenger's initial deposit was successfully credited into their escrow account.

4. **Confirmation from Driver**: If the passenger's deposit is confirmed, the driver must then send their own deposit to the escrow account before sending a "Confirmation" message back to the passenger, effectively confirming the successful booking and ride-sharing transaction between the passenger and the driver.
