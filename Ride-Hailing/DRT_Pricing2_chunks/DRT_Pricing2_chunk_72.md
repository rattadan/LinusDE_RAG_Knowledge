## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 72

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

Only the results for 𝛿𝑀 ∈ {15 s, 60 s} are shown, representing
short and long matching intervals. Values in between were tested as
well, but did not lead to better results than both presented values. The proportion of served requests (service rate 𝑆𝑅) as well as the
average waiting time (𝑊 𝑇 ) are reported for all three strategies. We
distinguish between the two specifications all vehicles and non-serving
vehicles, which indicate the vehicles available to receive a new request. The primary optimization goal considered is a maximum service rate;
the secondary goal is a minimum waiting time. According to this

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining two specific technical details: 

1. The proportion of served requests (service rate 𝑆𝑅) and the average waiting time (𝑊 𝑇 ) in three different matching strategies for short and long intervals.
2. The difference in results between using a maximum waiting time constraint (√D) and no maximum waiting time constraint (∛D) in the example of first-come-first-serve integration.

This chunk is building upon the surrounding context, which discusses various studies on ride-hailing systems, their operations, and optimization strategies for fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. The specific technical details mentioned provide insight into how these systems operate, including time until notification of customers and waiting times.

The requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned are:

* The analysis is focused on two matching strategies: first-come-first-serve (FCFS) integration with a maximum waiting time constraint (∛D) and without a maximum waiting time constraint (√D)
* Dynamic optimization models are proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals
* Machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning, are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems.
