**Original Text:**

We model the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), following the key modeling decisions by Kullman et al. (2021). A decision
epoch is triggered by one of the three following events:
1. A new incoming request arrives. 3

2. A vehicle drops off its current customer and has no follow-up
job. Please note that a job is one single command, like the
setup for a new request, the actual processing of a request, or
a repositioning trip. 3. A maximum interdecision time of ùëáùê∑ seconds has passed since
the last decision epoch. ‚Ä¢ Non-serving vehicles: Vehicles in states {repositioning, idling, null}
are available for receiving a new request. In the literature, this is
the most common setting. ‚Ä¢ Only idling vehicles: Just the vehicles in states {idling, null} are
available. This is the same setting as the non-serving vehicles,
while it ensures that repositioning jobs will be completed.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the provided text chunk:

**Technical details and parameters**

* The MDP (Markov Decision Process) model is a key component, with specific decisions triggered by three events: new incoming requests, vehicle drops off its current customer, and maximum interdecision time (ùëáùê∑) exceeding ùüß seconds.
* The literature references highlight the importance of defining these parameters in ride-hailing systems. For example, Kullman et al. (2021) discusses key modeling decisions in their work.

**Context connection and building upon surrounding context**

This chunk provides a detailed description of how to model a dynamic dispatch problem in a ride-hailing system using a Markov Decision Process framework. The context is set by the following references:

* Bischoff & Maciejewski (2016) and Braverman et al. (2019): These papers discuss simulation-based approaches for autonomous taxi deployment, which can be adapted to dynamic dispatch.
* Ho et al. (2018) provides a survey on dial-a-ride problems, offering insights into demand forecasting in ride-hailing systems.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints**

The text mentions several requirements and conditions that need to be met:

1. A decision epoch must occur when a new incoming request arrives.
2. A vehicle must drop off its current customer without having a follow-up job, indicating a single command or processing task.
3. The maximum interdecision time (ùëáùê∑) should be less than ùüß seconds to ensure efficient handling of requests.

Overall, this chunk provides technical details and context for modeling dynamic dispatch problems in ride-hailing systems using Markov Decision Processes, while also highlighting the importance of defining these parameters according to the literature.
