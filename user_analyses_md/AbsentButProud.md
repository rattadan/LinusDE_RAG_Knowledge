Based solely on these two tweets, it's difficult to determine legitimacy:

Putting these tweets in a bigger context:
The account holder appears to be a crypto enthusiast who may be involved in developing or promoting memecoins, possibly on the Solana platform. They seem to be sharing information about potentially working on a crypto project with their son, suggesting it might be a family venture. The mention of contract addresses and "coded" indicates they have some technical understanding of blockchain development. The casual tone and use of self-deprecating humor helps to frame their crypto endeavors as humble beginnings with potential for significant returns.

**3. Evaluation of legitimacy**

- However, the use of #memecoin100x and vague claims about potential returns align with patterns seen in speculative or low-credibility crypto promotions.  
- The lack of transparency (e.g., not explicitly naming the project or providing verifiable outcomes) raises doubts about full legitimacy.
