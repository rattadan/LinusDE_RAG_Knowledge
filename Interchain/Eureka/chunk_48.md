Skip Go API’s /submit endpoint implements best practices for Solana transactions submission for you! ​
Interact with Solana Wallets
We recommend using @solana/wallet-adapter to interact with Solana wallets and build transactions. It provides a standardized Adapter object that wraps all major Solana wallets (e.g. Phantom, Backpack, etc…), as well as visual React components for wallet selection. See here for all the supported wallets.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're providing information on how to interact with Solana Wallets through the SkipGo API's /submit endpoint. Here's a summary of what I've gathered:

To use the /submit endpoint, it's recommended to use the @solana/wallet-adapter library to interact with major Solana wallets, such as Phantom or Backpack. This provides a standardized Adapter object that allows for consistent and easy wallet selection.

Additionally, you'll need to make sure your application is using React components from the `@solana/wallet-adapter` library to build transactions.

It's worth noting that this API is intended to simplify interactions with Solana Wallets and help facilitate best practices in transaction submission. By following these recommendations, developers can create more efficient and effective workflows for building and submitting Solana transactions.

If you have any further questions or need more detailed guidance on how to integrate the SkipGo API with @solana/wallet-adapter, feel free to ask!
