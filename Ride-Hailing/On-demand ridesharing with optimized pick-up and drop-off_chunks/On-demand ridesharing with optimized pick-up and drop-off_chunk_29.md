**Original Text:**

Note that, for given PUDO points, the
route can be fully defined by the sequence in which requests are served, as shortest paths are followed between two consecutive stops. To optimize the sequence and PUDO points, one needs to take into account only the status of v and the characteristics of the requests in
τ, regardless of the rest of the system, because we assume no congestion. The arc’s cost cost(τ, v) is the one that results after optimizing
the sequence and the PUDO points. The calculation of an arc’s cost is exemplified in Fig. 3, when including the group formed only by P3 to a vehicle v already assigned
to two previous requests P1 , P2 , following the sequence (O2 , D2 , D1 ). Assume that, according to some exogenous constraints, there are
two feasible new sequences (O2 , D2 , O3 , D3 , D1 ) or (O2 ,D2 ,O3 ,D1 ,D3 ), and two possible pick-up and drop-off locations for P3 . This makes
a total of eight possible ways to insert P3 into v’s route, such that the cheapest one will define cost({P3 }, v).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining a technical detail related to ridesharing systems:

**The exact technical details:**
The section describes how the optimal route can be determined for a given set of PUDO points (Pick-up and Drop-off points) in a ridesharing system. The key concept is that the optimal sequence of requests to serve at each stop should be chosen, while considering only the status of the vehicle (`v`) and the characteristics of the requests (`τ`), regardless of the rest of the system.

**The process described:**
To optimize the sequence, one needs to:

1. Calculate the cost of each arc (route segment) between consecutive stops.
2. Select the optimal sequence that results in the lowest total cost.
3. Consider only the status of the vehicle (`v`) and the characteristics of the requests (`τ`), regardless of the rest of the system.

**The parameters used:**
The parameters used are:

* `v`: the current vehicle, which is assumed to be already assigned to two previous requests.
* `τ`: a set of characteristics representing the requests at consecutive stops.
* The cost function `cost(τ, v)` is not explicitly defined in this section, but it is implied to be calculated based on the arc's sequence and PUDO points.

**How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:**
This section builds upon the key themes identified earlier in the reference list. It specifically addresses the challenges of optimizing ridesharing routes considering various factors such as vehicle status, request characteristics, and PUDO points. The use of mathematical modeling and simulation techniques (e.g., Fig. 3) is highlighted as a key approach to addressing these challenges.

**Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:**
No specific requirements or conditions are mentioned in this section. However, it is assumed that the following constraints apply:

* There are two feasible new sequences for inserting P3 into v's route.
* Each sequence consists of five stops (O2 , D2 , O3 , D1 , D3).
* Two possible pick-up and drop-off locations for P3.

Overall, this section provides a technical foundation for analyzing ridesharing systems and optimizing routes considering various factors.
