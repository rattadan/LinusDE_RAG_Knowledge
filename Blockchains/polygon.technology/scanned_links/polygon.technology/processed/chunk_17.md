### Document Overview  
The content outlines events at ETHDenver focused on zkVMs, interoperability, and blockchain collaboration, with sessions on custom ISAs, ZK-coprocessors, and multi-chain DeFi.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **zkVMs (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines)**: Privacy-preserving execution environments for blockchain.  
- **Interoperability**: Bridging blockchain networks (e.g., EVM, L2s) to enable cross-chain transactions.  
- **Custom ISAs (Instruction Set Architectures)**: Alternative instruction sets for zkVMs to enhance flexibility.  
- **ZK-coprocessors**: Hardware components enabling zero-knowledge proofs for efficient computation.  
- **Multi-chain DeFi**: Tools and frameworks enabling decentralized finance across multiple blockchains.  

### Implementation Details  
- **AggCave**: Feb 26–27, 8–5pm MST; includes a "reverse dunk tank" (fun activity).  
- **AggDay**: Feb 28, 8–6pm MST; features panels on alt-VMs, DeFi interop, and L2 debates.  
- **Polygon Labs Booth**: On-site at ETHDenver (Booth 318) from Feb 27–Mar 2.  
- **Technical Sessions**: Focus on zkVM benchmarking, ZK-coprocessors, and custom ISAs for interoperable future.  

### Related Topics  
- **Polygon Knowledge Layer**: Connected to the blog and social channels for updates.  
- **Web3 Aggregation**: Ties to broader themes of collaboration and cross-chain interoperability in Web3.  
- **ETHDenver**: Linked to previous sessions (e.g., AggDay recordings) and the Polygon Labs booth.

AggCave, Day 2, is an exploration of zkVMs in an interoperable future.

Along with core developer teams from Agglayer and Zisk, guests from Lita Foundation and Lagrange will speak about Custom ISAs, zkVM benchmarking, and ZK-coprocessors.

If youâre going to be at ETHDenver, stop by the AggCave and AggDay to understand the frontier of crypto thatâs coming into view on the horizon. Aggregation is about coming together, and that begins by getting in the same room and letting the magic of discussion and collaboration happen.

Polygon Labs will also be onsite at the ETHDenver conference at booth 318 from February 27 - March 2. Swing by for some swag and say hello to some of the breakout apps on Polygon PoS!

If youâre not heading to Denver this year, stay tuned for session recordings from Aggday andcatch up on previous sessions.Â

Tune into theblogand our social channels to keep up with updates about Polygon.

The future of Web3 is aggregated.
