## Overview

<think>
Let me analyze these tweets from ViktorBunin:

First, let me understand each tweet:

1. "RT @rstormsf: ðŸ˜”ðŸ’” I'm Roman Storm. I poured my soul into Tornado Cashâ€”software that's non-custodial, trustless, permissionless, immutable, uâ€¦" - This is a retweet from ViktorBunin of a tweet by Roman Storm (rstormsf), who is likely referring to himself in the message. The tweet references Tornado Cash, a controversial cryptocurrency privacy tool that was sanctioned by OFAC in August 2022. This tweet appears to be expressing sympathy or solidarity with Storm.

2. "Which are you most hype on and why?" - This is a short tweet asking for opinions, though it's unclear exactly what the author is referring to when asking what others are "hype on."

3. "Interesting new scam angle. Compromise a real media handle and rather than posting a CA, try to get folks into the tg scam machine. Stay safe out there friends." - The tweet warns about a new scam approach where attackers compromise legitimate media accounts and redirect users to Telegram scams rather than posting a cryptocurrency scam directly. The author is cautioning others about security risks.

4. "RT @ethereum: 0/ Ethereum is for financial market infrastructure: a guest thread by @malekanoms" - This is a retweet of an Ethereum Foundation tweet about Ethereum's role in financial market infrastructure.

5. "RT @ant_sabado: Looking forward to seeing my team contribute more to @aztecnetwork" - This is a retweet of a tweet by Anton Sabado (ant_sabado) referencing Aztec Network, a privacy layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

6. "One interesting observation is that Lightning adoption on Coinbase mirrored the style of Lightning network growth broadly - a slow and steady increase irrespective of market conditions. There's not really sudden jumps, mostly just a gentle slope upwards." - This tweet discusses Lightning Network adoption on Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, and notes that its growth pattern is similar to the overall growth of the Lightning Network.
