## Source Context
*From: https://www.avax.network/*

### Document Overview  
This content explains Avalanche's validator system, its low hardware requirements, and the process for staking AVAX to secure the network and earn rewards.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: The consensus mechanism where validators stake tokens to secure the network.  
- **Validators**: Stakeholders incentivized to secure the network, earning rewards for their efforts.  
- **Staking**: Locking AVAX to participate in consensus and earn rewards.  
- **Low Hardware Requirements**: Avalanche is designed to run on minimal hardware, making it accessible to most users.  
- **Reward Structure**: Validators receive AVAX rewards for securing the network.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Low Hardware Requirements**: No special equipment or high-priced hardware is needed to run a node.  
- **Staking Process**: Users must stake AVAX to become validators, earning AVAX rewards for securing the network.  
- **Validator Rewards**: Stakers receive AVAX as a reward for their contributions to network security.  
- **Validator Stats**: Includes metrics like stake amounts, validator addresses, and network performance.  

### Related Topics  
- **Validator Stats**: Section detailing key statistics for Avalanche validators.  
- **Validator FAQ**: Section providing important information for validators.  
- **Staking Process**: Overview of steps to become a validator, linked to the "How to Become a Validator" section.
