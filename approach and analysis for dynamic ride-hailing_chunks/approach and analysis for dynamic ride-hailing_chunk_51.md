I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

Additionally, we
keep track of the vehicles that can be repositioned in this epoch. This
excludes the vehicles currently serving customer requests. The number
of serving vehicles ending their jobs in the respective zone simultaneously forms the absolute minimum supply for that zone because
these vehicles cannot be prevented from becoming available in that
zone in the short-term future. This minimum supply is used as the
initial solution. Since we have to distribute the existing supply in a
‘‘fair’’, proportional way among the zones with different demand, we
make use of the Jefferson/D’Hondt method (Gallagher, 1991), originally
proposed by former US president Thomas Jefferson to distribute seats in
the parliament to the different parties or states proportionally to their
respective election results or population size. A quotient is calculated
for each zone (‘‘party’’) by dividing the expected demand (‘‘votes’’) by
the number of vehicles (‘‘seats’’) already assigned to this zone plus 1.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining how dynamic dispatch and repositioning works in ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on the minimum supply required for each zone.

Here's a focused analysis:

1. Technical details: The process involves calculating the expected demand (votes) per zone using the Jefferson/D'Hondt method, which distributes seats (vehicles) proportionally to their respective election results or population size.
2. Connection to the surrounding context:
This chunk builds upon the concept of dynamic dispatch and repositioning in ride-hailing systems, as mentioned in points 1 and 3. It explains a specific aspect of this process.
3. Requirements, conditions, or constraints:

The requirement for the minimum supply per zone is based on the expected demand (votes) calculation using the Jefferson/D'Hondt method. This method distributes seats proportionally among zones to ensure fair distribution, taking into account their population size or election results.

In essence, this section provides a mathematical formula (Jefferson/D'Hondt method) for calculating the minimum supply per zone in dynamic dispatch and repositioning, which is essential for allocating vehicles efficiently in ride-hailing systems.
