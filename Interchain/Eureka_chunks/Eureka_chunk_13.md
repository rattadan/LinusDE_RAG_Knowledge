## Eureka - Chunk 13

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

Security council
The Eureka Security Council is designated as a 5-of-7 council that can take actions such as:

upgrading the ICS20Transfer, ICS26Router, IBCERC20 and Escrow contracts
migrating light clients in case of freezing due to misbehaviour, expiration or security vulnerabilities/incidents
designating specific canonical names for IBC applications and light clients on Ethereum mainnet
The security council cannot take these actions instantly - the actions are timelocked using a standard OpenZeppelin TimelockController contract with a minimum delay of three days. The delay gives an opportunity for the Cosmos Hub to halt inbound / outbound transfers in case of a malicious action taken by the Security Council.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is providing technical details and parameters about potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on:

1. **Technical details**: Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) timeout mechanisms, Post-Swap Failures, and the use of OpenZeppelin TimelockController contract.
2. **Contextual connection**: The text builds upon the surrounding context provided by documenting a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, including Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol) and Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), as well as Hyperlane and Go Fast.
3. **Requirements and conditions**:
   - Timelock delay: 3 days
   - Inbound/Outbound transfers halted in case of malicious actions by the Security Council

This chunk is explaining the technical parameters and processes related to cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on the implementation details of Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocols (IBC) and their potential failure points. The connection to the surrounding context is through a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols.

The requirements mentioned include:

* Timelock delay: 3 days
* Inbound/Outbound transfers halted in case of malicious actions by the Security Council
