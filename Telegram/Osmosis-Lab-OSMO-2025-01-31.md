osmosis_statbot at T21:56: a link to support site. Not a key point unless there's a recurring issue. sean_pop at T19:13: excited about Eco for one-click L2 stablecoin liquidity. Important because they mention a specific project (Eco) aiming to simplify processes. 

griffin_web3 at T19:03: "Not really. Pretty solid update" ‚Äì maybe responding to a question about an update's quality. ARGottardi at T19:01: "Yep. R.I.P Nomic" ‚Äì indicates Nomic is defunct. 

mtsu22 at T16:01: asks why there's no INJ swap in Keplr. Technical issue or feature request. griffin_web3 at T15:18: checked Nomic's chat, they're implementing an update. So Nomic is having issues but working on a fix.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided chat messages as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or topics.

Starting with the first message: "This warms my heart" ‚Äì that's an emotional reaction, so maybe "Positive sentiment" or "Emotional response". 

Next, IBCnoticer's message: "good night my sweet little orb friend. One day I will save you ü§ó" ‚Äì this seems like a friendly sign-off, possibly referencing a project or token named Orb. So topics here could be "Friendly interaction" and maybe "Orb token".

Then osmosis_statbot links to support site. The topic here is clearly "Osmosis support", since it's a bot directing users to help.

sean_pop mentions Eco and one-click solutions for L2 stablecoin liquidity. That's about "Eco project" and "L2 stablecoin liquidity solutions". Also, the user is excited about simplifying processes, so maybe "Simplification of blockchain processes".

griffin_web3 says "Pretty solid update" ‚Äì so "Positive feedback on update" or just "Blockchain updates".

ARGottardi refers to Nomic with "R.I.P Nomic", indicating issues with Nomic, so "Nomic issues" or "Nomic failure".

mtsu22 asks about swapping INJ in Keplr. That's about "Keplr wallet limitations" and "INJ token swapping issues".

Another griffin_web3 message about an update implementation ‚Äì reinforces the "Blockchain updates" topic.

pjfoxpjfox mentions Nomic stopped working and error 405. So "Nomic service outage" and "Error 405".

Dondada8 and so_wily discuss Mantra price discrepancies. Topics here would be "Mantra token price discrepancy" and "Liquidity issues on Cosmos ecosystem".

Bigburtha and kychuli's conversation is about using Noble USDC, trading, and withdrawing. Topics include "Noble USDC usage", "Trading strategies on Osmosis", "Withdrawal process on Osmosis", and "Gas fees in FET".

The osmosis_statbot appears again, so "Osmosis support" is repeated.

Putting all these together, I need to list each unique topic without repetition. Let me check again to ensure I didn't miss any. The

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided several chat messages with timestamps and usernames. I need to go through each one and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First message: "sean_pop... This warms my heart." The phrase "warms my heart" is definitely positive. So that's a positive sentiment.

Next: "IBCnoticer... good night my sweet little orb friend. One day I will save you ü§ó" "Good night" and "sweet" are positive, and the emoji adds a friendly tone. The mention of saving someone could imply hope. Positive.

Third: "osmosis_statbot... If you need help, visit our official support site..." This is a neutral statement, just providing a link. No emotional words here, so neutral.

Fourth: sean_pop again. He says "can't wait for all this to be abstracted away ü§£" and talks about being excited about Eco for one-click solutions. The emoji here is laughing, maybe at the current complexity. He's excited, so positive.

Griffin_web3: "Not really. Pretty solid update." The "not really" might be responding to a previous negative comment, and "solid update" is positive. So overall positive.

ARGottardi: "Yep. R.I.P Nomic." RIP usually indicates something is dead or failed. That's negative.

mtsu22: "Why there is no option for swaping INJ in keplr ?" The user is asking a question about a missing feature. Could be frustration, so maybe negative.

Griffin_web3 again: "Checked out their chat, looks like they are implementing an update." Mentioning an update being implemented is positive, as it suggests progress. Positive.

pjfoxpjfox: "maybe thats a good sign? (-:" The user is speculating optimistically. The smiley face adds a positive touch. Positive.

Another pjfoxpjfox message: "hrllo - Nomic stopped working? Tried to get stsaking rewards... and got error 405." There's a typo in "hrllo" and "stsaking". The main point is Nomic stopped working and an error occurred. That's negative.

Dondada8: Talks about Mantra price being lower than Oracle prices, mentions liquidity issues. This seems like a negative observation about the market.

so_wily: Asks why Man

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and see if there's anything actionable mentioned.

Starting with the first message from sean_pop: "This warms my heart." That's an emotional response, no action items here. Next, IBCnoticer says, "good night my sweet little orb friend. One day I will save you ü§ó." Again, a friendly sign-off, no actions.

Then there's osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's a helpful link, so maybe that's an action item for users needing help. Sean_pop later mentions Eco's one-click solution for L2 stablecoin liquidity. That's more about future plans, not an immediate action.

ARGottardi and griffin_web3 are commenting on Nomic's status, with pjfoxpjfox and pfoxpjfox discussing an error 405 on Nomic. The user pjfoxpjfox reports an issue, but there's no decision or next step mentioned except maybe checking the support site. Griffin_web3 says they're implementing an update, so that's a decision or next step from Nomic's side.

Mtsu22 asks why there's no swap option for INJ in Keplr. That's a question but no action item unless someone is supposed to address it. So_wily and Dondada8 are discussing Mantra's price discrepancy, possibly indicating a liquidity issue, but no specific action steps here.

Bigburtha and kychuli have a conversation about using Osmosis. Bigburtha asks about gas fees and trading, and kychuli explains that they can use various tokens for gas once on Osmosis. The key points here are the steps involved in depositing, trading, and withdrawing using different tokens. Also, kychuli suggests using Noble USDC for better liquidity, which is a recommendation (next step). Bigburtha's questions are about the process, so the answers provided are instructions on how to proceed.

I need to make sure I capture any explicit instructions or decisions. The main action items would be the support link from the statbot, the update implementation by Nomic, and the suggestions to use Noble USDC or specific tools like Squid or Skip. Also, the mention of Eco's solution is a future step but might be relevant
