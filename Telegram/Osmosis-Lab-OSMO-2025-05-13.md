## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. 

First, I need to go through each message and identify the main ideas. Let me start from the earliest messages. 

The first message from Nostradamus411 mentions that Confio will stop maintaining CosmWasm in June, and chains like SEI are moving away, leading to a bleak future for CosmWasm. Then, another message from the same person says that using Solidity could tap into a larger developer pool. 

Mrtiahou responds by pointing out that CosmWasm has advantages over EVM because deploying smart contracts doesn't modify the chain's consensus, allowing modularity. They also mention Osmosis did great things with CosmWasm, like the smart accounts module. 

BasementNodes comments that many EVM teams are unwilling to change their apps, possibly due to lack of knowledge, and that EVM allows forking existing code without needing deep understanding. 

Nostradamus411 again brings up the point about Solidity's first-mover advantage and larger developer numbers, suggesting even if there are more bad developers, there might be more skilled ones too. 

Then there's a discussion about Polaris, an Osmosis project, which is a cross-chain aggregator targeting a bigger market. Davidjgoosey mentions it's live in beta, integrates tools like SquidRouter, and aims to increase Osmosis's trading volume. 

Other messages include some off-topic comments like "Keep bleeding" and attending Consensus Toronto, but those might not be key points. 

The osmogovbot message talks about a proposal to whitelist a Hydro address for deploying Vortex contracts on Osmosis. Vortex is a concentrated liquidity protocol. 

Mrtiahou and others discuss technical competence of developers being a bigger issue than the language itself, and whether moving to EVM would help attract better developers. 

Also, there's a mention of ICF's funding being used effectively by Skip, and that ICF is moving towards Cosmos EVM. 

Putting this together, the main points are the comparison between CosmWasm and EVM, the future of CosmWasm with Confio's maintenance ending, Osmosis's initiatives like Polaris and Vortex, and the debate over developer skills versus language choice. 

I need to structure this conc

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to read through all the messages carefully to identify recurring themes and key points.

Starting with the earliest messages, there's a mention of Polaris being live in beta. Davidjgoosey talks about Polaris being a mega-aggregator integrating products like Squidrouter and Uniswap. That's one topic: Polaris Beta Launch. Then, the effect on Osmosis price comes up, so maybe "Impact on Osmosis Token Price" is another.

Next, Nostradamus411 mentions Confio ceasing maintenance of CosmWasm in June and chains like SEI moving away. That's a significant point about CosmWasm's future. Then, discussions around Solidity vs. CosmWasm, with points about developer pools, network advantages, and technical competence. So topics here could be "Solidity vs. CosmWasm Adoption" and "Developer Competency in Blockchain Projects".

BasementNodes comments on EVM teams not wanting to change code and relying on forking existing projects. That suggests "EVM Developer Practices" and maybe "Forking in EVM Development". Mrtiahou brings up Osmosis using CosmWasm for modules like Smart Accounts, so "CosmWasm Use Cases in Osmosis" might be relevant.

There's also a proposal to whitelist a Hydro deployment address for uploading contracts on Osmosis, which relates to governance and contract deployment. So "Osmosis Governance Proposal for Hydro Deployment" and "Vortex Protocol Deployment on Osmosis" could be topics. 

Additionally, Vitalik and Ethereum moving towards RISC-V is mentioned, which is a different angle. Maybe "Ethereum's Shift to RISC-V". The user also refers to ICF and Skip, indicating "ICF Funding and Skip Protocol" as another topic.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other key points. The later messages about Consensus Toronto attendance and a technical discussion about terms might not be major topics. Also, some messages are just reactions or side comments without a clear topic. 

Putting it all together, the main topics seem to be around Polaris, CosmWasm vs. Solidity, developer competence, Osmosis governance, Vortex protocol, and Ethereum's RISC-V shift

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- osmosis (10 mentions)
- polaris (8 mentions)
- cosmwasm (7 mentions)
- evm (7 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a series of chat messages, and I need to determine the overall sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. First, I'll go through each message one by one to understand the context and tone.

Starting with the earliest messages. The first one from Nostradamus411 on May 13th at 04:04 mentions that ICF (probably Interchain Foundation) has a big bag of money being used well with Skip taking over. The words "actual good use" and the link to Cosmos EVM suggest a positive outlook. So that's a positive message.

Another message from the same user at 04:05 talks about ICF moving towards Cosmos EVM, implying that the future of CosmWasm might be bleak because Confio is stopping maintenance and chains like SEI are moving away. The phrase "future seems pretty bleak" is clearly negative. Wait, but there's a contradiction here. The first message from Nostradamus411 is positive about ICF and Cosmos EVM, then the next one is negative about CosmWasm. So maybe the user is expressing both positive and negative sentiments in different topics.

Then, looking at BasementNodes' messages. At 13:45:22, they say "Coming **soon**(tm)" with the tm symbol. The use of bold and tm might indicate sarcasm or doubt about the timeliness, which could be negative. At 17:17:53, user_1782979360 asks if something affects the price, noting Osmosis price is "dented." The word "dented" is negative. Davidjgoosey responds that bringing volume is good and no one can predict token prices, which is neutral but leaning positive.

BasementNodes at 17:18:10 says "You don't have to have a clue to 'build' with EVM because there's so much existing stuff already done." The tone here seems critical of EVM, suggesting it's easy to use but maybe not in a good way, implying developers just fork without understanding. That's a negative sentiment towards EVM.

At 17:19:10, BasementNodes says "Oh damn it's now?" indicating surprise or frustration, possibly negative. Then Mrtiahou's message at

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a chat conversation with various messages. I need to go through each message and identify any specific tasks, decisions made, or upcoming actions mentioned.

Starting with the first message from Nostradamus411 at 2025-05-13T23:53:58+00:00. They're comparing CosmWasm and Solidity, mentioning network effects and developer numbers. But I don't see any action items here, just opinions.

Next, Mrtiahou at 22:56:53 talks about Cosmwasm's advantages over EVM, modularity. Again, more discussion, no specific action.

BasementNodes at 22:39:37 mentions EVM teams not changing code because they don't know how. Not an action item, just a critique.

BasementNodes at 22:38:45 says you don't need a clue to build with EVM because you can fork existing stuff. Still analysis, no action.

The messages at 22:38:10, 21:58:59, 21:54:54, and 17:19:10 don't seem to have actions either. They discuss developer competence, Osmosis using CosmWasm, and a joke about a misclick.

Nostradamus411 at 21:11:55 mentions Confio stopping CosmWasm maintenance in June and chains like SEI moving away. That's a future event but not an action item from the text itself.

At 17:18:53, davidjgoosey says bringing volume to Osmosis is good, but it's a general statement. Then user_1782979360 asks about price effects, which is a question without an action.

Looking at the messages from 17:06:03 and 17:04:29, davidjgoosey announces Polaris is live in beta. The Osmosis team is developing it, and they're thinking about accruing value. So maybe the action here is that the team is developing Polaris and considering strategies. Also, the
