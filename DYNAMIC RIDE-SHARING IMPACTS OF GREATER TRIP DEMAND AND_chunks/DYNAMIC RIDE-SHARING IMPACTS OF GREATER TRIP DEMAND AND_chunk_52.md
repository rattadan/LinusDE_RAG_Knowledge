## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 52

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**1. Technical details and parameters:**

The current text chunk focuses on user preferences regarding autonomous vehicles (transp. Res. Part C Emerg. Technol. 78, 37–49). The specific technical details mentioned are:

* A study by Hall et al. (2018) investigating whether Uber is a substitute or complement for public transit.
* A study by Harb et al. (2018) projecting travelers into a world of self-driving vehicles and estimating travel behavior implications via a naturalistic experiment.

These studies suggest that users have varying preferences regarding autonomous vehicle services, with some preferring substitutes (Uber), others preferring complements (public transit), or neither.

**2. Context connection and building upon:**

The current text chunk connects to and builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Providing an overview of shared autonomous vehicle research, highlighting key topics such as congestion pricing, parking needs, consumer preferences, optimization techniques, effects on vehicle ownership and emissions, and "peak car" phenomenon.
* Introducing specific references (Hall et al., Harb et al.) that expand upon these themes, providing in-depth studies on user preferences regarding autonomous vehicles.

The text also establishes a connection to the broader transportation research field by mentioning authors such as K.M. Kockelman and J.W. Ward, whose work may be relevant to understanding the context of shared autonomous vehicle research.

**3. Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

There are no explicit requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk. The text appears to provide a neutral, informative introduction to the topic of user preferences regarding shared autonomous vehicles, without any specific demands or expectations for further analysis or action.
