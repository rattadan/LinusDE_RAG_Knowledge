## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 16

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Smart matching through
directionality constraints, delay checking and a heuristic for the constrained shortest path helped
manage the extent of detours that may be allowed while maximizing pooled trips. Demand for SAVs is expected to follow that of TNCs since the segment of population likely to
travel in each of these modes largely overlap (Krueger et al., 2016; Haboucha et al., 2017;
Lavieri et al., 2017; Stoiber et al., 2019). Unlike Gurumurthy et al. (2020b), the Bloomington
application does not have a calibrated vehicle ownership model for a future of SAVs and only
relied on fare and wait time impacts for predicting SAV demand. Therefore, all comparisons are
with respect to SAV travel without DRS, as opposed to present-day travel. The activity scheduler
in POLARIS is currently not sophisticated enough to jointly route multiple travelers in highoccupancy trips.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

The current text chunk describes a technical process for managing the extension of detours allowed while maximizing pooled trips when utilizing Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs). Specifically, it highlights the use of directionality constraints, delay checking, and a heuristic for finding the constrained shortest path to achieve this goal.

**Context Connection:**

This chunk connects directly to the surrounding context by referencing the shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance reference list discussed in the previous sentence. It appears that the author is providing specific technical details on how to manage SAVs within an urban transportation system, using real-world data and concepts from a scholarly article (Stoiber et al., 2019).

**Requirements and Conditions:**

The text requires knowledge of:

1. Directionality constraints
2. Delay checking
3. Heuristics for constrained shortest paths
4. Optimizing strategies for SAVs within an urban transportation system

Conditions include the need to consider the overlap between travel modes among specified demographics (Krueger et al., 2016; Haboucha et al., 2017; Lavieri et al., 2017), as well as limitations in the current activity scheduler in POLARIS.

This text assumes a basic understanding of SAVs, their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, and relevant technical concepts.
