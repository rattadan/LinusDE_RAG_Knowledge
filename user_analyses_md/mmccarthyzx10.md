It's encouraging people to formally request their organizations support and propose the London Cab Council.

The language is brief and direct, with a call-to-action tone. It uses formal language ("Formally request they support & propose") but is not overly complex. The tone seems urgent, focused on organizing collective action.

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
Without more context about what the London Cab Council is, what it represents, and what the Cab Council is proposing, it's difficult to evaluate the legitimacy of this message. The tweet itself is straightforward, asking organizations to support a council. The account handles involved (taximanant and mmccarthyzx10) would need more research to determine who they are representing.
