3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
Based on the content, this doesn't appear to be a legitimate crypto promotion or information channel:
- The content is mostly critical of projects rather than promotional
- There's no clear attempt to deceive users with fake airdrop links
- The channel name "Cosmos Airdrop Chat" suggests it's a discussion space, not an official account

5. Evaluation of the author's character:

Looking at these messages collectively, it appears that they come from multiple users in the Cosmos community rather than a single author, but we can discern patterns in the overall community sentiment:

Personality traits:

Potential motivations and values:

- Possibly hoping to warn others about unreliable projects

Emotional patterns and tendencies:
- Frequently expressing frustration and disappointment
- Using humor to cope with losses
- Occasional expressions of hope for future projects
- A pattern of initial excitement followed by disenchantment

Decision-making approach:
- Experience-based with a skeptical view of new projects

- References to exchanges (Binance, Bybit, Gate.io)
