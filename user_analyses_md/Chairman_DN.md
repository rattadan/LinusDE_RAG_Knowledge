3. Evaluation of legitimacy:

Putting some tweets into the context of intentions:
The tweet "If you’re in $SALARY ... THIS IS THE PEOPLES COIN" suggests the author is trying to build a grassroots movement around Salarycoin.
The tweet about paying $10 for a mango shake and calling for "INFLATION HIGHER W HASTE" appears to be attempting to connect real-world inflation experiences with the need for crypto adoption.
The tweet "Elon giving generational entries on memes rn!! $SALARY SUPERCYCLE" suggests the author is trying to capitalize on Elon Musk's influence on meme culture and crypto markets to promote Salarycoin.
The tweet "RT @7Cents_Trader: In a world where you’re told your time is worthless. @Chairman_DN is building a coin that says: Your story matters." positions the author as someone creating a coin with emotional resonance or narrative value.
