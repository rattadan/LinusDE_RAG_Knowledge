Numerical example
To provide a numerical illustration of this problem, in this section we employ the proposed analytical model to optimize different operating strategies for a DRT service in different optimization scenarios. This DRT system is assumed to provide a curb-to-curb service for its users in an area of 
 mi2 with a network travel parameter of 
, and a fixed peak demand of 
 requests. It is assumed that the fixed demand is uniformly distributed over 3 hours of the peak period with a fixed
Conclusions
The inherent trade-off between the operating cost and the quality of service of a DRT system necessitates optimizing the operations to balance them. In this paper, an analytical model based on Daganzo (1978) is employed to approximate fleet size, VHT, and VMT of the DRT system. Accordingly, the operating cost for the agency is estimated as a linear combination of these components.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you've provided a snippet from a research paper or academic article on optimizing Demand Response Transportation (DRT) systems. Here's a breakdown of what's been discussed:

* The authors introduce an analytical model to optimize different operating strategies for a DRT service, considering various factors such as the operating cost and quality of service.
* A numerical example is provided to illustrate the application of this model in a specific scenario, where the DRT system operates in an area with a travel time network parameter of 0.5 hours per mile and a peak demand of 300 requests over 3 hours.

Some key points mentioned include:

1. The inherent trade-off between operating cost and quality of service necessitates balancing these two factors to optimize DRT operations.
2. An analytical model based on Daganzo (1978) is employed to approximate fleet size, Vehicle-to-Herbivore Traffic (VHT), and Vehicle-to-Motor Traffic (VMT) for the DRT system.
3. The operating cost of the agency is estimated as a linear combination of these components.
