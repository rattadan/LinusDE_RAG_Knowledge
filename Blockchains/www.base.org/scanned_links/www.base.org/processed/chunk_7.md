# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_7.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.base.org/*

### Document Overview  
This content provides a guide for learning to build smart contracts and onchain applications using the Base platform, focusing on decentralized features, gasless transactions, and tools for rapid development.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **AI Agents**: Self-contained entities for interacting with onchain data and smart contracts.  
- **Decentralized Social Features**: Integration of user-generated content and identity management.  
- **DeFi Protocols**: Direct integration with DeFi services for financial applications.  
- **Gasless Transactions**: Ability to transact without paying gas fees, using account abstraction.  
- **Passkey-Based Accounts**: Universal accounts for secure onchain interactions.  
- **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**: Core framework for executing smart contracts.  
- **Solidity**: Language for writing smart contracts.  
- **Hardhat/Forking**: Tools for testing and deploying contracts.  
- **Etherscan**: Platform for verifying and monitoring smart contracts.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Toolkit**: Build apps in 10 minutes with pre-built components and infrastructure.  
- **Deployment**: Deploy to Base Sepolia (a testnet) and verify contracts via Etherscan.  
- **Gasless Apps**: Use bundled infrastructure for free credits and no gas fees.  
- **Passkey Accounts**: Implement via a universal account system for seamless onchain access.  
- **Testing**: Use Hardhat and Typechain for contract testing and deployment.  
- **Code Examples**: Include snippets for deploying contracts, verifying tokens, and integrating DeFi services.  

### Related Topics  
- **EVM Diagram**: Linked to the "EVM Diagram" section for foundational understanding.  
- **Setup and Overview**: Connected to the "Setup and Overview" section for development workflows.  
- **Testing with Hardhat**: Linked to the "Testing with Hardhat and Typechain" section.  
- **Deployment to Base Sepolia**: Referenced in the "Deployment in Remix" and "Contract Verification" sections.  
- **Warpcast and Coinbase Wallet**: Mentioned as platforms for showcasing mini apps.
