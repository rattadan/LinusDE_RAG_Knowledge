2.2.5. Acceptance
When a passenger broadcasts a ride request, they may receive multiple proposals from nearby drivers. To
select the best proposal, the passenger will typically compare prices and time estimates computed locally
before choosing the one that best meets their needs. To accept a proposal, the passenger must first initialize an escrow account using the proposerâ€™s NRIDE address. This involves sending a deposit into the escrow account, which can be automated for convenience.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It looks like you're proposing a data model and some business logic for handling proposals in a ride-sharing or transportation service. Here's a breakdown of your proposal:

**Proposal structure**

* The `Proposal` class has four properties:
	+ `id`: a unique identifier for the proposal
	+ `source`: the source of the proposal (e.g., driver)
	+ `proposalID`: an internal ID assigned by the system to this specific proposal
	+ `escrowAccount`: the escrow account used to hold deposits from passengers

**Acceptance**

* When a passenger receives a proposal, they can initiate acceptance by sending a deposit to the proposed driver's escrow account.
* The escrow account is initially empty (not sent in the initial proposal).
* The deposit amount can be automated for convenience.

This approach seems like a good starting point. Here are some thoughts and suggestions:

* Consider adding a `status` property to the `Proposal` class, e.g., `active`, `pending`, or `rejected`.
* When sending a deposit, you might want to also verify the passenger's identity (e.g., using their login credentials) to prevent unauthorized transactions.
* You could also add a `cancel` method to allow passengers to withdraw their deposits if they change their minds about accepting the proposal.
* How do you plan to handle cases where the escrow account is empty or depleted?
