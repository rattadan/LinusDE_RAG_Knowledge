**Original Text:**

Without FCFS integration, the matching aims for maximum efficiency, leading to some customers being
matched much earlier than others. With FCFS integration, only the
longest waiting customers are considered, resulting in a more inefficient
use of the fleet and thus intensifying the problem of undersupply. At the
same time, all customers now have to wait longer. In our experiments,

the price of fairness is an increase in the average waiting time by a
factor of 2 to 5. Additionally, in almost all cases, all quantile values of
the customer waiting times are better without the FCFS integration. What is the price of a quick response? The main argument
for the nearest strategy is the immediate response. The matchingbased approaches usually allow to delay the response up to the maximum waiting time ùëáùëä . While this can improve the solution quality
in some settings (cf. Table 2), it also decreases the customer convenience.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

The technical details mentioned in this chunk include:

1. Simulation of autonomous taxi deployment in Berlin by Bischoff & Maciejewski (2016)
2. Evaluating demand forecast aggregation for shared AV fleets by Braverman et al. (2019) and Ho et al. (2018)
3. Survey on dial-a-ride problems by Ho et al. (2018)

These references suggest the use of simulation models to analyze various aspects of ride-hailing systems, including autonomous taxi deployment, demand forecasting, and matching algorithms.

**Context Connection and Building:**

This chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

1. Mentioning the need for dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems
2. Providing a summary of key references on the topic (Simulation and modeling, Dynamic dispatch and repositioning, Rebalancing strategies, Demand forecasting)
3. Introducing the main argument for using the nearest strategy (immediate response) to match customers based on their waiting time

This chunk also builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing a brief overview of the current state of research in ride-hailing systems
2. Setting up the problem statement, which is that matching customers optimally without FCFS integration leads to inefficiencies and increases average waiting times.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

There are no specific requirements or constraints mentioned in this chunk. However, it is implied that:

1. The use of simulation models is necessary for analyzing the efficiency and impact of dynamic dispatch and real-time management
2. The immediate response strategy has both benefits (improved solution quality) and drawbacks (decreased customer convenience), highlighting a potential trade-off between fairness and convenience.

Overall, this chunk provides a technical overview of the current state of research in ride-hailing systems and sets up the problem statement for further discussion.
