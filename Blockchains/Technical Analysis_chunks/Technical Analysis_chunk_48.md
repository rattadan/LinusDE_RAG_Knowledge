**Original Text:**

A series of lower highs in price accompanied by higher highs in MACD can precede significant downturns. Moving Average Convergence Divergence and Risk Management
While moving average convergence divergence can provide valuable trading signals, it’s crucial to incorporate proper risk management techniques:

Stop-Loss Orders
Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Place stops at logical levels based on market structure, such as below recent support for long positions. Position Sizing
Don’t risk more than a small percentage (typically 1-2%) of your trading capital on any single trade, regardless of how strong the moving average convergence divergence signal appears. Confirmation
Wait for additional confirmation before entering a trade based solely on MACD signals. This might include price action patterns, support/resistance levels, or signals from other indicators. Market Analysis
Consider fundamental factors and overall market sentiment alongside moving average convergence divergence analysis.
