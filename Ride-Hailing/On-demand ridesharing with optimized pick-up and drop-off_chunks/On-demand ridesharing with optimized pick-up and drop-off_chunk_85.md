**Original Text:**

The proportion of the total time that is spent walking, depicted in Fig. 7, is also consistent with (and lower than) real-life cases: most
of the travellers spend a minor part of the time walking, but in some rare cases the access and egress times are very high in comparison
with the in-vehicle time. Previous analyses of this same comparison reveal that:
• In Sidney, Australia, out of the transit users that spend less than 15 min in the vehicle, the 75th percentile of walking distances is
775[m] (Daniels and Mulley, 2013), resulting in a 75th percentile of the ratio between walking and total travel times of at least 0.38
(using a walking speed of 5[km/h]), whereas in our simulations this number is 0.08. • In Santiago, Chile, experiments ran by the local authority (studied by Durán-Hormazábal and Tirachini, 2016) show that the same
75th percentile is 0.18. The maximum value for the same ratio is 0.85, which is slightly lower than the maximum we obtain: 0.92. 3.2.3.
