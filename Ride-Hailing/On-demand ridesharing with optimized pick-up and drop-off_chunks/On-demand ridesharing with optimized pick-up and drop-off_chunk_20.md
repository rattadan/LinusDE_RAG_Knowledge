**Original Text:**

Finally, the optimal amount of walking in public transport networks has been investigated extensively. Seminal works on this topic
were proposed by Hurdle (1973), Kocur and Hendrickson (1982), Chang and Schonfeld (1991), which introduced “access costs” when
optimizing transit lines’ frequencies and spatial separation jointly. These access costs are proportional to users’ walking times, an idea
that we also follow in this paper. These ideas have been extended more recently by Daganzo (2010), Badia et al. (2014), Fielbaum et al. (2020) to include lines’ density in the design of a bus transit network, and by Tirachini et al. (2010) when comparing different transit
modes’ costs. A similar approach was followed by Tirachini (2014) to calculate the optimal distance between consecutive stops within
a single bus line. 1.3.
