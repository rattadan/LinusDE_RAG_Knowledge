schemes, the number of DRT trips increases to a lesser extent, which is explained by the limited number of available
DRT vehicles (see in particular 3a). The DRT vehicle fleet size is set to a fixed number of 10,000 vehicles in all
simulation experiments. DRT vehicles operating at the capacity limit yields long waiting times for some DRT users
who will eventually prefer a different mode of transportation. Depending on the service area and pricing scheme, the
DRT trip share of all trips in the Berlin area ranges from 0.04% (DRT service area: inner-city Berlin area; Minimum
fare: 3.00 EUR) to 4.9% (DRT service area: entire Berlin area; Minimum fee: 0 EUR).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that the text is describing a research paper on public transportation, specifically using the Demand Response Transit (DRT) system in Berlin. The authors are analyzing how different pricing schemes and number of DRT vehicles affect the usage and share of the service.

The key points mentioned include:

* Reducing the number of available DRT vehicles can decrease the number of trips, which is expected to reduce waiting times for users.
* A fixed fleet size of 10,000 vehicles was set in simulation experiments.
* The study found that at full capacity, there were long waiting times for some users who may prefer alternative modes of transportation.

The article also discusses how the percentage of DRT trips and trip share varies depending on factors such as:

* Service area (inner-city vs. entire Berlin)
* Pricing scheme (Minimum fare: 3 EUR; no Minimum fee)

These findings can inform urban planning decisions for public transportation systems, aiming to balance demand with resource availability and user preferences.
