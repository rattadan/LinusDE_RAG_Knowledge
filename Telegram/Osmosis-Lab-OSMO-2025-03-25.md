## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. Let me start by going through each message to understand what's being discussed.

First, there's a user asking about the real APR for OSMO on Osmosis. Mikebarb and spectreeeeeee are discussing that the APR is around 11.48% according to Numia, which differs from the 11% listed on the Osmo site. Mikebarb mentions that APR can vary because it includes swap fees. So the key point here is the APR discrepancy and its variability due to swap fees.

Then, cosmosp4tr1ck brings up a governance proposal about Valence, allowing Hydro to automate liquidity deployments. They provide links to the forum and Hydro's tweet. The decision here is about the proposal passing and its potential impact on Osmosis.

HOSS_ibc talks about future plans, mentioning the launch of Polaris which might bring more users. Also, Mrtiahou notes that OSMO inflation will be net negative by year-end, leading to supply decrease. This is a key point for the project's future.

Other messages include users discussing charts, support links, and congratulations. The main decisions and topics are the governance proposal, APR details, and future developments like Polaris and Valence. I should highlight these, along with the net negative inflation as a bullish factor. Also, note the support site link provided by the statbot.

I need to make sure the summary is clear, includes the main points, and any decisions or implications. Avoid redundant info like multiple support site mentions. Organize the points logically: governance proposal, APR clarification, future developments, inflation, and community engagement.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis

Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start by reading all the texts carefully.

The first message is from mikebarb asking to open a ticket to check something. That sounds like a helpful or neutral request. Then osmosis_statbot links to the support site, which is standard support response, so neutral. user_7833444581 has a problem with the bridge and asks if the team is online. The mention of a problem might be negative, but they're seeking help, so maybe neutral unless they express frustration. 

mikebarb's next message talks about increasing BTC liquidity and the launch of Polaris bringing users. That's positive because it's about growth and future benefits. rodnas83 asks about future plans, which is neutral as it's a question. user_5642624394 asks how high the coin can go, which is neutral but could be slightly positive if they're curious about gains. 

Mrtiahou mentions OSMO inflation becoming net negative and supply decreasing, calling it bullish. Definitely positive. HOSS_ibc says they'll shill Osmosis, which is positive as it's promoting. Another HOSS message talks about charts looking better, turbulence but staying positive, so overall positive. The link from HOSS is just a URL, so neutral. 

dasjdbka congratulates with an emoji, which is positive. xTr3ndy asks about charts, which is neutral. HOSS_ibc's message about vibing with Architects and inviting someone to swing through seems positive. xTr3ndy calls HOSS a big hosssss, which is positive. Agreed! Give him a bag! lol from xTr3ndy is positive.

Another message from mikebarb explaining APR variations is neutral. spectreeeeeee's original APR question is neutral.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I'll read through each message to understand the context.

Starting with the first few messages: user_7833444581 has a problem with the bridge and asks if the team is online. Mikebarb says to open a ticket so he can check. So that's an action item‚Äîopening a ticket. Then there's a message from the statbot directing to the support site, which might be a standard response but not an action item from the user. 

Next, rod nas83 asks about Osmosis's future plans. Mikebarb mentions increasing BTC liquidity and trade volume, and the launch of Polaris. That's more informational, but maybe the next steps for the team would be related to Polaris, so I should note that.

User_5642624394 asks how high the coin can go. Not sure if that's actionable; maybe not. Then Mrtiahou talks about Osmo inflation being net negative by year-end, which is a decision or a fact, but not an action item. HOSS_ibc mentions shilling Osmosis, so that's a decision to promote it. He also talks about the chart and sticking around for three months, which might be a next step for investors, but not sure if it's an official action.

There's a link from HOSS_ibc to a Twitter status, but that's just sharing a link. Dasjdbka congratulates someone, so no action. XTr3ndy asks about charts, which is a question, not an action. Then there's a discussion about staking APR. Spectreeeeeee asks for the real APR, and Mikebarb suggests checking Numia and mentions it's around 11.48%, which might be a next step for the user to check that site. 

Cosmosp4tr1ck mentions a governance proposal draft about Valence and Hydro automating liquidity. The action items here would be checking the forum post and the Hydro tweet, and possibly participating in governance. Also, the user might need to ask questions on the forum. 

Other messages are about the mobile app, graphics, and general comments without specific actions. So the main action items are opening a ticket, checking Numia for APR, reviewing the governance proposal
