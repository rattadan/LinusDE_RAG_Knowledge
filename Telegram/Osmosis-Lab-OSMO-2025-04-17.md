## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and figure out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions.

Starting from the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot repeating the support site link. That's probably important to mention as a recurring support notice.

Then user_343756695 talks about $BNB starting in 2017 with a big move in 2021, 4 years apart and aggressive 0 rate. Maybe that's a comparison for OSMO's potential? Not sure, but the key here is the time frame and rate mention.

norrisherr says to keep accumulating OSMO because it's undervalued compared to others like radium, cake, Joe. So that's a recommendation to hold or buy more.

Another user_343756695 message mentions it's capped with a burn mechanism, leading to long-term growth. Important to note the burn mechanism and long-term outlook.

Then there's a message about QE (Quantitative Easing?) where someone says being 100% down but 10x is break-even. So some users are holding for a future event expecting gains.

davidjgoosey introduces Polaris, the Token Portal integrating Skip, Squidrouter, Rango, etc. This seems like a major update or new product from Osmosis. They're asking for feedback on the beta.

CryptoIsaacdeeks mentions being 100% down on OSMO and needing 10x to break even. Shows some user frustration but also long-term hope.

Then there's a support message again from osmosis_statbot. Repetition here might indicate emphasis on support resources.

r2009dio is asking for an admin in Telegram and hasn't had questions answered. Points to possible support issues or community concerns.

SoulRa1ser and jasbanza discuss swapping NEAR to OSMO or USDC via bridges like Rainbow-Bridge, CCTP bridges (Noble Express, Skip Go), and mention high slippage (40%) and fees ($3-4). They also talk about using Rango.Exchange and Squidrouter. So the key here is the process and options for bridging tokens, with some challenges like slippage.

jasbanza also

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as comma-separated values.

First, I'll go through each message to identify the key points. The text includes various chat messages from different users and timestamps. The main topics should be the recurring or significant subjects discussed.

Looking at the first line, there's a mention of the Osmosis support site. That's about support resources. Then user_343756695 talks about $BNB starting in 2017 with a parabolic move in 2021, so that's related to cryptocurrency price trends. Another message from the same user mentions a capped token with a burn mechanism, which points to tokenomics.

norrisherr advises accumulating and mentions Osmosis being undervalued compared to others like radium, cake, and Joe. That's investment advice and comparisons. Davidjgoosey introduces Polaris, a new product integrating various services, which is a product announcement and integration of tools like Skip, Squidrouter, Rango, aggregators, DEXes, bridges. There's a link to a Twitter post about Polaris beta.

SoulRa1ser has questions about swapping NEAR to OSMO, decentralized swaps, and bridging NEAR to Osmosis for USDC. They mention slippage issues and specific platforms like Rango, Rainbow-Bridge, CCTP bridges, noble express, and skip go. Jasbanza provides solutions involving Allbridge, swapping NEAR to Solana USDC, then bridging to Osmosis. Also, mentions using IBC and checking if NEAR supports IBC.

Other messages discuss tracking lost positions, Pulsar app integration with Osmosis, and criticisms about community contributions. BasementNodes comments on Pulsar being a legend in the ecosystem and tracking positions across chains.

So compiling all these, the main topics are:

- Osmosis support site
- Cryptocurrency price trends ($BNB, OSMO)
- Tokenomics (burn mechanism, capped tokens)
- Investment advice (accumulating, undervalued)
- Token comparisons (radium, cake, Joe)
- Product announcements (Polaris)
- Integration of tools (Skip, Squidrouter, Rango, aggregators, DEXes, bridges)
- Decentralized swaps (NEAR to OSMO)
-

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Let's start with the first one.

"OSMO started in 2017 and the major parabolic move was in 2021, that‚Äôs 4 years apart and with a aggressive 0 rate." Hmm, the user is talking about a cryptocurrency's history and a significant price move. The mention of "parabolic move" usually indicates a rapid increase, which is positive. But the "aggressive 0 rate" might refer to interest rates or something else. Not sure if that's negative, but the main point here seems to be the positive price movement.

Next: "Keep accumulating. It is very undervalued at the moment as compared to counterparts like radium, cake and Joe." The user is advising to keep buying, saying it's undervalued. Comparing to other tokens which might be more expensive. This sounds positive because they're bullish on OSMO.

Another message: "The thing is Capped and has a burn mechanism, long term it‚Äôll just go up." Capped supply and burn mechanisms are typically seen as positive factors for a cryptocurrency's value. So positive sentiment here.

Then: "that‚Äôs more like 90% tho. Long term it‚Äôll be fine, you can go from 10X underwater to up 10X if you hold till QE." The user acknowledges a 90% loss but says long term it's fine. They mention holding until QE (Quantitative Easing?), which might be a positive outlook despite current losses. So mixed but overall positive because they believe in future gains.

CryptoIsaacdeeks says: "I'm like 100 percent down on OSMO.... 10x is break even." This is clearly negative. 100% down means a total loss, and needing 10x to break even suggests frustration or disappointment.

The message from davidjgoosey about Polaris, the Token Portal, integrating various services and inviting feedback seems positive. They're promoting a new product, which is a proactive and positive move.

SoulRa1ser has several messages about swapping NEAR to OSMO. They mention issues like 40% slippage and seeking the cheapest route. This sounds negative because they're facing problems. However, when they

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a series of chat messages from different users, and I need to go through each one to identify any tasks or decisions mentioned.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot at 18:53:03. It's a link to the support site. Not sure if that's an action item, but maybe the bot is directing users to seek help there. So maybe the action item is to visit the support site if needed.

Next, user_343756695 at 14:46:08 talks about $BNB's history and a parabolic move in 2021. Not sure if there's an action here, maybe just analysis. Then norrisherr at 14:44:52 says to keep accumulating because it's undervalued. That's a recommendation, so the action item could be "Continue accumulating OSMO tokens as they are considered undervalued compared to other projects."

Another message from user_343756695 at 14:43:22 mentions that it's capped with a burn mechanism, implying a long-term hold. So maybe "Hold OSMO tokens long-term due to capped supply and burn mechanism."

At 14:42:36, same user talks about being underwater but expecting gains if held till QE. So maybe "Consider holding OSMO until quantitative easing (QE) for potential recovery and growth."

davidjgoosey at 14:20:55 says TBD but working on integrating features for Polaris. Not a concrete action, but maybe "Continue development and integration efforts for Polaris to enhance functionality."

CryptoIsaacdeeks at 13:50:27 is down on OSMO, needing 10x to break even. Not an action item, just a sentiment. Then davidjgoosey at 13:48:30 announces the Polaris beta and asks for feedback. So action items here could be "Launch Polaris beta and invite community feedback" and "Promote Polaris as a Token Portal integrating multiple DEXes and bridges."

Other osmosis_statbot messages are just repeating the support link. Then r2009
