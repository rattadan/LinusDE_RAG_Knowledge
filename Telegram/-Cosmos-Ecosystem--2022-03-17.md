## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this chat text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The conversation is between several people, including NicKromme, citizenweb3, and others.

First, looking at the timestamps, the messages start from Mohmmadykk asking for snapshot details and all Cosmos airdrop list. Then citizenweb3 clarifies that they're not the admin and that their group is Citizen Cosmos, not part of the Cosmos ecosystem. They provide two links for airdrop info. NicKromme initially thought tag-wearing members were admins but corrected that, and someone else mentioned adding info to the group bio. There's also a message from Raul_SRE about BitCanna's Lambo and GP Spain, but that might be off-topic.

Key points seem to be:
1. Citizenweb3 clarifies they aren't admins and their group's identity.
2. They provide two links for airdrop information.
3. NicKromme and others discuss admin tags and suggest adding info to the bio.
4. Mohmmadykk and others are asking about snapshots and airdrop lists.

Decisions might be the suggestion to add the links to the group bio for clarity. The main issue is confusion about admin roles and group affiliation. The links are resources for airdrops, which citizenweb3 recommends. Also, the correction that they're not part of Cosmos ecosystem but are Citizen Cosmos.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without the extra chatter. Maybe structure it as the main topics and the recommendations/suggestions made. Also note the self-correction by NicKromme and the clarification from citizenweb3.

**Summary:**  
- **Group Clarification:** Citizenweb3 clarifies their group is "Citizen Cosmos" (not part of the broader Cosmos ecosystem) and emphasizes they are not admins.  
- **Airdrop Resources:** They share two links for airdrop information: [Cosmos Uplink Airdrops](https://cosmosuplink.web.app/airdrops) and [The Cosmos Coffeehouse Airdrops](https://www.thecosmoscoffeehouse.com/airdrops), advising others to locate snapshot details there.  
- **Admin Misunderstanding:** NicKromme initially assumes tag-wearing members are admins but corrects himself. Citizenweb3 confirms lack of admin rights and humorously notes shared surprise.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided chat messages as a comma-separated list.

First, I'll read through the text to understand the context. The messages are from different users discussing a group, possibly related to Cosmos, but there's a clarification that they are "Citizen Cosmos" and not part of the Cosmos ecosystem. They mention airdrops, snapshot info, and some links. There's also a mention of BitCanna and a GP Spain event.

Looking for recurring themes: 
- Airdrops are mentioned multiple times with links provided.
- Snapshot details are requested by a user, indicating that's a topic.
- Clarification about the group's identity (Citizen Cosmos vs. Cosmos ecosystem) comes up a few times.
- Admin rights and tagging the admin are discussed.
- BitCanna is mentioned twice, once linked to a Lambo and a tweet.
- There's a reference to GP Spain, GT3 event, which seems unrelated to the rest but is part of the messages.

So the main topics would be: airdrops, snapshot information, group identity clarification, admin rights, BitCanna, and GP Spain GT3 event. I need to make sure these are the most relevant and recurring points. Let me check again. The links provided are for airdrops, snapshot details are asked, there's confusion about the group's affiliation, admin tagging, BitCanna's mention, and the racing event. That seems to cover all key points without being too granular.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a series of chat messages, so I need to go through each one and determine the overall sentiment.

Starting with NicKromme's first message: "Hehe, actually had a giggle there.. at least admin is tagged now. Ty for that ‚úå" The words "giggle" and "hehe" are positive, showing amusement. "Ty" (thank you) and the peace emoji ‚úå also indicate gratitude. So that's positive.

Next, citizenweb3 says: "The admin is @Antropocosmist . If we do have admin rights, we are just as surprised hahah" The mention of being surprised and "hahah" suggests a light-hearted, maybe neutral or slightly positive tone. They're clarifying admin rights, which is more informational than emotional.

NicKromme responds: "I thought tag-wearing members were admins by default, my bad üòÖ" The emoji here is a smiley with a grin, indicating they're acknowledging a mistake in a friendly way. Still positive.

citizenweb3: "Its not our group. We are just sharing info" This is factual, neutral. No strong emotions here, just stating a fact.

citizenweb3 again: "Im not the admin!" Exclamation mark, but it's a correction. Maybe slightly negative? But the context is clarifying, so probably neutral.

NicKromme: "Maybe add it to the bio in the group, though. Could indicate as much as you're repeating it üôà" The emoji here is a face with hands over eyes, maybe embarrassment or shyness. The suggestion to add to bio is constructive, so neutral to positive.

NicKromme: "Kinda funny, kinda flattering too, indeed, but thanks for the links mate ‚úå" Words like "funny," "flattering," and "thanks" are positive. The peace emoji reinforces that.

citizenweb3's longer message: "Guys. You keep on mixing us with Cosmos ecosystem =) We are super flattered, but we are Citizen Cosmos..." They mention being flattered, which is positive, but also clarify a misunderstanding. The mix of "=)" emoji and the explanation could be neutral with a positive note.

The rest of the messages are URLs, mentions of snapshots, and a reference to BitCanna's Lambo and GP Spain GT

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat. First, I'll read through the messages carefully.

Starting from the earliest message: Mohmmadykk asks for all cosmos airdrop list. Then citizenweb3 responds saying they're not part of the Cosmos ecosystem, they're Citizen Cosmos, and provides two links. They mention needing to find snapshot info. So here, maybe the next step is to check those links for airdrop info. 

Later, Mohmmadykk tags @admin asking for snapshot details. NicKromme initially thought tag-wearing members were admins but corrected himself. Then citizenweb3 clarifies that they aren't the admin and another user, Antropocosmist, is. NicKromme suggests adding admin info to the group bio to avoid confusion. 

Another user, leonoorcosmos, shares a Twitter link, and Raul_SRE mentions BitCanna's Lambo event at GP Spain GT3. 

So possible action items: 
1. Check the two websites provided by citizenweb3 for airdrop info.
2. Determine if the group should update their bio to clarify admin roles.
3. Identify the correct admin (@Antropocosmist) for any admin-related queries.
4. The BitCanna event mentioned might be a next step for attendees, but not sure if it's an action item for the group.

Wait, the user is asking to extract action items, decisions, or next steps. So from the conversation, the main points would be the suggestion to add admin info to the bio, the clarification about the admin handle, and the links provided for airdrop info. Also, Mohmmadykk's request for snapshot details might prompt contacting the admin. 

Decisions: Maybe the group decided to use those two links as resources. But since citizenweb3 is part of the group, perhaps they are suggesting others to use those links. 

Next steps: NicKromme's suggestion to update the bio, and the users needing to check the provided links and contact the admin for snapshot info. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other points. The BitCanna event is mentioned but seems like a separate note. The main actionable items are around the admin clarification and the airdrop resources.
