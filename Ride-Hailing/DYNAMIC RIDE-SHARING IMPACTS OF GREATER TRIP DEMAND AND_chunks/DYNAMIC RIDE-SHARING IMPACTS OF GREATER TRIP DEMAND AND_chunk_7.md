## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 7

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Various survey results also suggest that travelers will be
more willing to share rides in the future (Krueger et al., 2016; Stoiber et al., 2019; Gurumurthy
and Kockelman, 2020). Simulation studies have quantified the usefulness of DRS under different settings. Case studies
in Austin, Texas have shown how total VMT can fall - thanks to heavier use of DRS when trip
densities are high (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2018), but road tolling may also be needed to shift
users into shared fleets and shared rides (Zhao and Kockelman, 2018; Simoni et al., 2019;
Gurumurthy et al., 2019). Dense settings, such as New York City (Alonso-Mora et al., 2017) and
Chengdu, China (Tu et al., 2019), stand to benefit a great deal from DRS. Alonso-Mora et al. (2017) used the NYC taxi dataset to show how optimized DRS using 2,000 10-seater vehicles
(15% of the taxi fleet) or 3,000 4-seater vehicles (22% of the taxi fleet) can serve these trips with
low response times.
