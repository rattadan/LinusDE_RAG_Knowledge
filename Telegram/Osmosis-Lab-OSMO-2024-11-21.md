## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions.

Starting from the top, there's a greeting in Arabic, then someone praising Osmosis. The statbot links to support. Then skaik007 mentions something happening and TG being unavailable. Arcmosis is talking about creating a pool and position issues, maybe with SOL. There's a command line for creating a position with some parameters. Then a user reports a scammer impersonating an admin, and others discuss privacy settings to block such calls. Another user has a problem with Keplr and a "key doesn't exist" error. 

Further down, there's a discussion about staking APRs varying between platforms like Mintscan and DataLense. JohnnyWyles explains why the differences occur, mentioning protocol fees. Then issues with a DGN deposit showing as failed due to relaying timeouts. Some users mention browser performance differences. Also, a user can't swap INT3 tokens and asks how to get them for gas fees. The statbot and others direct to support sites and faucets.

I need to group these into categories: technical issues (pool creation errors, DGN deposit problem, INT3 token), security advice (blocking scammers), staking APR discrepancies, and app performance (slow browser). Also note the support links provided. Make sure to mention the key decisions or solutions like adjusting privacy settings, using specific faucets, checking different APR sources, and clearing cache.

Avoid including less important messages like casual greetings or off-topic comments. Focus on actionable items and problems users are facing. Check timestamps to ensure relevance, but since all are on the same day, probably all recent. Need to present this clearly without markdown, just paragraphs. Keep it brief but cover all main points. Let me structure that now.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user provided a list of chat messages from various people, and they want me to list the main topics as a comma-separated list. 

First, I need to go through each message and see what the key points are. Let me start by reading each line carefully.

The first message is a greeting in Arabic, "Assalamualaikum," which is a common Islamic greeting. Not sure if that's a topic or just a message. Maybe not a topic unless others respond similarly.

Next, AndroidMcrypto says Osmosis is a beautiful platform. So Osmosis platform is mentioned positively. Maybe a topic here is "Osmosis platform appreciation."

Then, osmosis_statbot provides a support link. That's about support resources, so the topic could be "Osmosis support resources."

skaik007 asks if something happened or if it's just them, and another message says "The TG was unavailable." TG probably refers to Telegram. So that's about service availability, maybe "Service outages or downtime" or "Telegram unavailability."

Arcmosis is talking about creating a pool and position on Osmosis with specific commands and versions. They mention issues with SOL and an error message "Accepts arguments 6 received 5." This seems related to technical issues with Osmosis pools or transactions, so "Technical issues with Osmosis pools/transactions."

JohnnyWyles87 mentions Sneed not being in the chat, which might be a meme or inside joke. Not sure if that's a main topic unless others reference it. Maybe ignore unless more context.

Arcmosis thanks JohnnyWyles for a lesson and copy pasta, indicating educational content or tutorials. So "Educational content or tutorials."

Bl00dDIMIR says someone call them because they're lonely, which is a personal request. Not sure if that's a topic unless others do the same. Maybe not significant.

osmosis_statbot again gives instructions on stopping scammers, so "Scam prevention on Osmosis." Also, griffin_web3 mentions privacy settings to block non-contacts, which is related. So combine under scam prevention.

user_7151168156 reports an issue with the app: can't swap/sell, error "key doesn‚Äôt exist." So "User-reported app issues (e.g

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from a platform, possibly a Telegram group or Discord related to Osmosis, which seems to be a blockchain or DeFi project. My task is to analyze each message and determine its sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Then, summarize the overall sentiment.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with "master_atlas" saying "Assalamualaikum". That's a greeting in Arabic, usually neutral. No emotion there, just a hello. So neutral.

Next, "AndroidMcrypto" says Osmosis is a beautiful platform with a smiley. Definitely positive. The smiley adds to the positive vibe. Positive.

"Osmosis_statbot" is a bot providing support links. It's just giving information, no sentiment. Neutral.

"Skaik007" asks if something happened or if it's just them. That sounds like a problem they're facing, maybe a negative sentiment. But since it's a question, maybe uncertain. However, the context of the previous message says the TG (Telegram) was unavailable, so this is about a service issue. Negative.

Another "skaik007" message about Telegram being unavailable. Definitely negative. Technical issues are negative. Negative.

"Arcmosis" is posting some technical data about pools and versions. It's just data, no emotion. Neutral.

"JohnnyWyles87" mentions no Sneed with a smiley. Sneed might be a joke or a meme reference. The smiley indicates a positive tone, so positive.

"Arcmosis" thanking Johnny Wyles, calling him a good Cosmos boy. Gratitude is positive. Positive.

"Vveendettaa" says "Pay respect". It's a command, but contextually might be part of a joke or meme. Neutral unless there's sarcasm. Probably neutral.

"Arcmosis" again thanking for a lesson and copy pasta, calling someone a Gentleman & Scholar. Positive, especially with the emojis. Positive.

"JohnnyWyles87" talking about assets. Just a factual statement. Neutral.

"Arcmosis" asking between numbers. Technical question, neutral. Neutral.

"JohnnyWyles87" says the space was fixed. Positive because it's a solution. Positive.

"Arcmosis" has a technical issue with accepts and received numbers

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll need to go through each message carefully and see what's actionable.

Starting from the top, master_atlas says "Assalamualaikum" which is a greeting, so no action there. AndroidMcrypto praises Osmosis, also not an action item. The next message from osmosis_statbot provides a support link, but it's just information unless someone needs to visit it. 

Looking at skaik007's messages about TG being unavailable, that's a report of an issue but not an action item unless someone needs to check the status. Arcmosis mentions creating a pool but not finishing the position, leading to an error. He also had a command with an error message about arguments. JohnnyWyles provided a corrected command, so maybe the action item is to run that command again. 

Arcmosis also had a problem with SOL, so he might need to check the parameters. Then there's a message from Optimus_V about Gary Gensler stepping down, which is news, not an action. 

Further down, user_7151168156 reports issues with the app, getting a "key doesn‚Äôt exist" error. The support bot's messages about stopping scammers suggest changing privacy settings. Griffin_web3 mentions checking Keplr for reliable staking info. 

JohnnyWyles87 shared a link for APR data. There's a discussion about staking APR fluctuations and different platforms. Arcmosis and Griffin_web3 talk about the Ion bot not being updated. 

JackYespa had a DGN deposit issue, and kychuli mentioned relaying timeouts. Stefan3 asked about Osmosis app speed, and others suggested clearing cache. Kjie88 mentioned using Mantra/Osmosis, but not sure if that's an action. 

Profesija and kychuli discuss swapping OM tokens. Niiipp asked about getting INT3 tokens and there being no pool. Kychuli responded that there's a guide being made but no solution yet. 

The statbot repeats the support link. 

So action items would be:

1. Arcmosis needs to use the corrected command from JohnnyWyles87 to create the position.
2. User_7151168156 should check privacy
