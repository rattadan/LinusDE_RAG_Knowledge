# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_69.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.avax.network/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses the Codebase program's requirements for founders, emphasizing iterative development, market validation, and the importance of feedback loops to refine ideas while solving real-world problems.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Iterative Development**: Founders are encouraged to refine ideas through feedback and rapid iteration.  
- **Market Validation**: Ideas must address a large, real-world problem but remain practical and grounded.  
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous input from mentors, investors, and customers to shape product development.  
- **Domain Expertise**: Founders need to demonstrate deep understanding of their field to succeed.  
- **Go-to-Market Strategy**: Clear articulation of how a solution aligns with Avalanche’s ecosystem.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Team Collaboration**: Founders are advised to work with their team to create decision frameworks for quick adaptation.  
- **Real-World Problems**: Ideas must solve a large-scale market need (e.g., "reinventing music" is discouraged).  
- **Prototype Testing**: Success often stems from testing assumptions and adapting based on feedback, even if the initial idea isn’t perfect.  
- **Example**: The Chiss protocol (a successful project) wasn’t the founders’ original idea but was refined through feedback.  

### Related Topics  
- **Codebase Program Structure**: The document connects to the broader context of the Codebase program’s goals and expectations.  
- **Avalanche Ecosystem**: The importance of aligning ideas with Avalanche’s ecosystem is reiterated in the context of market validation.  
- **Founders’ Roles**: The text ties to broader documentation on startup strategies and product development practices.

will constantly receive feedback on their ideas from Ava Labsâ network of operators, investors, and other mentors, and they are expected to use this feedback to rapidly iterate on their product.Â

âItâs important for founders to have a scalable idea, access to customers, and a go-to-market strategy, but more than anything success in this program is about being decisive," Martin says. One of the best ways for founders to prepare for the program is to work with their team ahead of time to create a framework for making quick decisions as a team during the program to avoid wasting precious time and seizing business opportunities as they arise.Â

All Codebase teams are expected to come ready with ideas that solve real problems for a large user base while remaining grounded in practicality. Their idea should be targeted at a large market, but that doesnât mean it needs to be revolutionary.

âThe founderâs idea for a company should solve a problem that affects a lot of people, but should be more well-defined than âreinventing musicâ for example,â says Martin.Â

Martin advises founders preparing for the Codebase program to focus on clearly articulating how their idea addresses a specific market need and why Avalanche's ecosystem is essential to delivering that solution. The founders that tend to see the most success in the program are those that are able to demonstrate their domain expertise and show they've thought deeply about implementation and go-to-market strategies.

The key to preparing for Codebase isn't having a perfect idea. Many of Codebase's most successful projects, such as theChiss protocol, werenât the foundersâ original ideas when they entered the program. The important thing is for founders to come prepared to test their assumptions and adapt their vision based on feedback from mentors and potential customers.
