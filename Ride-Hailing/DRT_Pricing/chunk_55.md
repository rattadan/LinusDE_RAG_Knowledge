and the average travel time increases. In contrast, for all users switching from PT, bicycle and walk to the DRT mode,
the average beeline speed increases and the average travel time decreases. 4.3.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided table data, here are some observations and conclusions:

1. The cost of using the DRT service is increasing with the increase in distance traveled.
2. However, the average travel time for all users switching to the DRT mode is decreasing.

To analyze this further, we can calculate the difference between the original prices and the new prices, which will give us an idea of how much more expensive it is to switch from one transportation mode to another.

For example:

* Original price: 0.00 EUR (DRT service) vs. 3.00 EUR (PT), bicycle, and walk
New price: 1.52 EUR (DRT service)
Difference: 2.52 EUR

This means that switching from the DRT service to PT, bicycle, or walk is now more expensive than using the DRT service alone.

Similarly, we can calculate the difference for other combinations:

* Original price: 0.00 EUR (DRT service) vs. 1.05 EUR (PT), bicycle, and walk
New price: 2.10 EUR
Difference: 1.10 EUR

This suggests that switching from the DRT service to PT, bicycle, or walk is now cheaper than using the DRT service alone.

* Original price: 0.00 EUR (DRT service) vs. 1.52 EUR (PT), bicycle, and walk
New price: 2.33 EUR
Difference: 1.33 EUR

This indicates that switching from the DRT service to PT, bicycle, or walk is now more expensive than using the DRT service alone.

* Original price: 0.00 EUR (DRT service) vs. 1.80 EUR (PT), bicycle, and walk
New price: 2.85 EUR
Difference: 1.85 EUR

This shows that switching from the DRT service to PT, bicycle, or walk is now more expensive than using the DRT service alone.

* Original price: 0.00 EUR (DRT service) vs. 2.20 EUR (PT), bicycle, and walk
New price: 3.40 EUR
Difference: 2.40 EUR

This indicates that switching from the DRT service to PT, bicycle, or walk is now more expensive than using the DRT service alone.

Based on these calculations, it appears that switching from one transportation mode to another can result in significant cost savings when used in combination with the DRT service.
