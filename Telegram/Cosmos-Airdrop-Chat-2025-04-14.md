## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify the main topics.

Starting from the latest messages and moving backward. The most recent ones mention a price crash of Mantra (OM) from $6 to below $1, with a 90% drop. Liquidations over $70 million. CEO JP Mullin blames centralized exchanges for forced closures without warning. There's a lot of community reaction here‚Äîsome people are upset, others are sarcastic or critical, calling it a rug pull or scam. 

Looking at other messages, there's discussion about an airdrop where only 1/5th of eligible wallets have claimed. They mention boosting a tweet for community growth. Also, there's a link to a video and some references to previous incidents with other projects like Juno, Wolf, and Mantra. Some users are talking about presales being a red flag, and others are mocking the situation, comparing it to other failed projects.

Earlier messages mention airdrop claims, issues with wallets not showing drops on Keplr, and some humor about financial losses. There's also a mention of a Cosmoverse event and some unrelated links. Users are advising caution, like checking if teams are doxxed, avoiding VCs, and ensuring the project has a revenue-generating product.

I need to group these into key points: the price crash, CEO's explanation, airdrop participation, community reactions, criticism of centralized exchanges, and advice from users. Also, note the references to previous scams and the call to action for the tweet. Decisions might include the team's response (or lack thereof), users deciding to sell or not trust anymore, and the ongoing presale discussions.

Avoid including too much chatter‚Äîfocus on the main events. Make sure to mention the stats: 30K claims, 9M $ATC claimed, 60M unclaimed. Also, the 20K increase in Planq addresses. The humor and sarcasm can be summarized as community sentiment. The advice from SithLordx about team doxxing and FDV is important for decisions.

Check for any other key data points: liquidations, market cap drop, mentions of CertiK, and the arrest question about JP Mullin. Also, note the repeated "watch tomorrow" messages, which

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by going through each message to understand what they're talking about.

First, there's a message from itsmeartc mentioning "about 30 bucks/year." That might relate to a subscription or cost topic. Then Kartoffelfren asks about warehousing tomorrow, which seems like a separate topic. Ibrahimmadevu mentions Juno, Wolf, and a Japanese guy, which could be projects or people in the crypto space. Iconoicono asks about paying to post "seedmans," which might be related to NFTs or content posting fees.

Next, there's a message about adding subtitles in French and translating to English on desktop mode. Podmaster99 mentions Mantra going dead, which is a project collapse. Lf1980 talks about claiming a drop and Keplr, which is a wallet. Tzouzepe13 has trouble reading a message and asks for clarity. Rattadan's message is about an airdrop, Planq addresses, and boosting a tweet. Another Rattadan message accuses blockchain frontrunners of using web2 for a scam. Then another Rattadan message mentions a token presale as a red flag.

Iconoicono says "C? Out Of Mana," which might be a typo for "OOM" (Out Of Mana) related to Mantra. There's a YouTube link from iconoicono. Then "mantra is OOM" from iconoicono again. BasementNodes mentions it's a badge of honor, possibly referring to getting scammed. Another BasementNodes message talks about advisors working for scams and rug pulls. Iconoicono mentions someone working at companies that lost money, like Trade.io and Soma.finance. 

There's advice to use a translator, another YouTube link. SuperEra promotes Early Bird Tickets for Cosmoverse. Iconoicono asks if someone sold their bed, maybe joking about financial loss. Profesija jokes about sleeping with dad due to airdrop dependency. Iconoicono mentions a Patek Philippe watch price. Another message corrects the origin of OM being on ETH, DOT, then COSMOS. Nice_kind_Murphynode asks about Atom's status. Pandainfame comments on Cosmos without Do Kwon and Free Do Kwon, referencing

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages, all related to cryptocurrency, specifically mentioning projects like Mantra (OM), Juno, and others. I need to go through each message and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first message: "about 30 bucks/year". That seems neutral, just stating a cost. Next, "no warehousing tomorrow?" is a question without clear sentiment, so probably neutral. Then there's a mention of "Juno and wolf and this Japanese guy üòâ". The wink might indicate a positive or playful tone, but since it's about projects that might have failed, maybe negative? Wait, the user is comparing to others, maybe sarcastic. Hmm, tricky. Maybe neutral.

"How much do you have to pay to post those little seedmans?" Another question, neutral. The next one about adding subtitles and translating seems like a neutral instruction. "At least they got out somewhat. Mantra went dead" ‚Äì "dead" here is negative, so that's negative. "Cheers, claimed. Is the drop locked?" Cheers is positive, but asking about the drop being locked is neutral. So the first part is positive, the second neutral. But overall, maybe positive because of the cheers?

"Didn't get this i cant read can you send it more clear, thanks" ‚Äì frustration but polite, so maybe neutral. The message from Rattadan about the airdrop stats: "Planq Addresses up by 20K", etc. It's factual, but ends with thanking the community and mentioning more news. The stats themselves are neutral, but the last part is positive. So maybe positive? But there's also "Many people have yet to claim" which could be neutral or slightly negative. But the overall message seems to encourage claiming, so maybe positive.

Then "Thats how they rob you... web2 for presale scam" ‚Äì definitely negative. "Signup for token presale.. haahh red flag" ‚Äì negative. "C? Out Of Mana" ‚Äì maybe a typo, but "Out Of Mana" could be a pun on Out of Money, so negative. The YouTube link is neutral. "mantra is OOM" ‚Äì OOM as in Out of Money, negative. "it's a badge of honor" ‚Äì positive. "advisors work for every different scam" ‚Äì negative.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify any that indicate a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a planned next step.

Starting from the top, the first few messages are about costs and translations. For example, "iconoicono" asks about the cost to post seedmans and mentions adding subtitles in French then translating to English. Those could be action items: check cost for seedmans and translate subtitles. But wait, the user might be referring to their own actions or asking others to do something. Need to clarify if these are requests or just statements.

Then there's a message from "Lf1980" asking if the drop is locked and not visible on Keplr. That's a question, but maybe the next step is to check Keplr for the drop. However, unless someone is assigned to do that, maybe it's not an action item. The user might need to confirm if there's an explicit task here.

Looking at "Rattadan's" message about the Statistics: ATC Airdrop edition. They mention that many people haven't claimed their airdrop and encourage reminding others and boosting a tweet. So that's a next step: remind others to claim the airdrop and promote the tweet. Also, they mention more news about launch and presale coming, so maybe a decision to proceed with those.

Another part is "Master_Baker" stating Mantra rugged, which is a decision or event, but not an action item. Then "dhonironald" says the mantra team will release 90% claim, which could be a next step they're announcing. But is that a confirmed decision or a hope? The message says "soon," so maybe a planned action.

There's a mention of checking if the drop is locked on Keplr, but unless there's a specific task assigned, maybe not. Also, "MissRose_bot" says "watch tomorrow," which is a next step for others to watch an event or update.

Other messages include complaints and discussions about price crashes, but those don't have explicit actions. The user might need to look for any tasks that need to be done by the community or team. For example, promoting the tweet, checking on OM tokens, translating subtitles, and verifying the airdrop status on
