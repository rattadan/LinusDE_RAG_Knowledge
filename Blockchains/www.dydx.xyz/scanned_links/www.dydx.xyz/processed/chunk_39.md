Despite Bitcoinâs massive growth, China announced a crypto ban in 2021, leading to a decline in BTCâs price. Although Bitcoin quickly regained its value, 2022 was challenging for crypto projects and companies. First, Terraform Labs' multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency LUNA fell to zero after its experimental stablecoin UST failed when UST lost its pegged value. Many crypto companies and firms tied to LUNA and UST (e.g., Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, and Voyager) filed for bankruptcy. The centralized cryptocurrency exchange FTX, based in the Bahamas, also filed for bankruptcy in late 2022. Before the crash, FTX was worth anestimated $32 billion.

Regardless of the negative news in 2022, the global market cap for crypto assets hoveredaround $1 trillionfor most of the year. Crypto believers hope projects with solid fundamentals will weather the bear market conditions moving into 2023 and beyond.Â

Cryptocurrency has a dramatic history but is still in the earlier stages of its development.Â
