Putting some tweets in a bigger context:
The Alpha Points Carnival campaign seems to be a strategic effort to increase user engagement and trading volume on their platform through rewarding participation.

These marketing tactics suggest the company is trying to attract new users in a highly competitive crypto exchange market by offering early access to new tokens and rewarding active trading.

The Dubai event tweet and announcement about securing a Full Operational Licence from VARA in Dubai suggests strategic expansion into new markets, particularly the Middle East, and a focus on building credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of both regulators and users.
