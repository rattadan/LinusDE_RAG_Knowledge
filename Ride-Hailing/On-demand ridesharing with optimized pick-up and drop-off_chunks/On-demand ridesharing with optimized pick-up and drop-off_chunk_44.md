**Original Text:**

Moreover, even if we are using
low-capacity vehicles, we might optimize but at the cost of looking at each feasible solution, which can also be unrealistic if the number
of requests and vehicles is large, due to the huge possible number of trips. 2.3.2. Complexity of the assignment problem
The assignment problem (described by the ILP in Eqs. (8)–(11)) is also an extension of set-cover. In the set-cover problem, we are
⋃
given a universe set U and some subsets S1 , …, Sp such that pi=1 Si = U. Each set has a cost c(Si ), and the aim of the problem is selecting
some of these subsets such that they still cover U minimizing the total cost. Given an instance of the set-cover problem, let us define an
instance of the assignment problem:
• The set of requests is U. • Each (Si )i=1,…,p is a trip. • There are p vehicles. Each vi can serve Si only (making inequality 10 trivially fulfilled).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text focuses on the **assignment problem** within ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems.

### Exact Technical Details:

The assignment problem involves finding the most cost-effective way to assign requests to vehicles, with each vehicle having a limited capacity. In this context, the "requests" refer to trips or tasks that need to be fulfilled, and the "vehicles" are the cars or other ride-sharing services available for pickup.

### Connection to surrounding context:

This section builds upon the broader theme of ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems discussed in the reference list. The assignment problem is an extension of the set-cover problem, which was also addressed in the reference list.

### Requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:

* The assignment problem requires finding a feasible solution that minimizes costs.
* The number of requests and vehicles can lead to unrealistic scenarios if not optimized properly.
* The problem involves low-capacity vehicles, which means each vehicle has limited resources (in this case, seats).
* Optimization is key, but it may come at the cost of looking at all possible solutions.
* Real-world complexity arises from large numbers of requests and vehicles.

This section provides a technical analysis of the assignment problem within ridesharing systems, highlighting its relevance to the broader context discussed in the reference list.
