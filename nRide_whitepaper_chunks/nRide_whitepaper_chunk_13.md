This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

The use of a secret phrase helps to ensure that the refund process is secure and only authorized parties can
redeem their deposit. By including this key phrase in the termination message, the other party can then use
it to redeem their deposit from the escrow account. Termination {
String id;
String source;
String confirmationID;
String reason; // Completed or Cancelled
String secret;
}

2.2.8. TerminationAck
When a ride request is terminated by either the passenger or the driver, the other party can respond with a
"TerminationAck" message that includes a secret phrase. This phrase allows the counterparty to unlock
their part of the escrow account and receive their deposit, as well as any applicable cancellation fees. By responding with a TerminationAck message that includes a secret phrase, the user helps to ensure that
the refund process is secure and that the other party can redeem their deposit from the escrow account.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text describes the use of smart contracts for secure transactions between drivers and riders on the nRide platform.

**Technical Details:**
- Smart contracts are deployed on JUNO (CosmWasm), which is used as the underlying infrastructure for building the DAO infrastructure, including the escrow mechanism.
- The secret phrase in question is part of the termination message sent by one party to the other during a ride request termination process.

**How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:**

This technical detail connects to and expands on the broader discussion about nRide's mission, technology stack, and development milestones. It introduces the concept of smart contracts and their role in facilitating secure transactions between drivers and riders. The section also emphasizes the importance of decentralization, transparency, and equity in the platform's design.

**Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

None are explicitly mentioned in this technical detail, but it is implied that:

- Smart contracts must be deployed on JUNO (CosmWasm) to enable secure transactions.
- The secret phrase is part of a termination message sent between drivers and riders during ride request terminations.

However, the following conditions or constraints could be inferred from the surrounding context:

- Ensuring the security and integrity of the transaction process.
- Maintaining decentralization and transparency in the platform's decision-making processes.
- Achieving equitable value retention for both drivers and riders through reduced fees and increased transparency.
