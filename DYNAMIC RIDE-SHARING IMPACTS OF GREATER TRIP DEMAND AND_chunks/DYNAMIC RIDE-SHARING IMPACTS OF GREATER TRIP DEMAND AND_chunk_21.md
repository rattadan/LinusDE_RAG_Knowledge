## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 21

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

The in-house population synthesizer also helps
translate econometric models to agent-based input data. Trip demand across the Bloomington
region can be conveniently scaled up or down in POLARIS, once there is a calibrated demand
model. Yan et al.’s (2020) Minneapolis-Saint Paul region (and Twin Cities only) simulations
using MATSim as the base code suggest that a large increase in trip density is needed to observe

about 15% more shared trips. With this motivation, Bloomington’s 100% demand scenario was
scaled up by factors of 5 and 25 (500% and 2500%) in order to better detect the impact of SAVtrip-request density on DRS operations and AVOs. This meant that 5 or 25 times the population
of Bloomington, planned activities and made trips in the same region. A 5x and 25x increase in
trip-demand-density can easily congest links in the region and can confound with mode choices.

**Connection to or building upon the surrounding context:**

* The text builds upon the discussion of shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance, focusing on the role of trip demand in influencing this aspect.
* The reference list provided earlier sets a broader context for discussing various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems and operational strategies.

**Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

* 5x (factors of 5) and 25x (factors of 25) scaling up trip-demand-density to observe significant increases in shared trips
* A "100% demand scenario" in Bloomington, indicating a high level of demand for autonomous vehicles
* Scaling factors for simulating different population scenarios (500% and 2500%)
* Potential congestion issues and mode choice confounding effects when increasing trip-demand-density

This text chunk is explaining the technical details involved in scaling up trip-demand-density to simulate shared autonomous vehicle operations, specifically using MATSim as a base code. It builds upon the broader context of discussing shared autonomous vehicles and their potential impacts on urban transportation systems.
