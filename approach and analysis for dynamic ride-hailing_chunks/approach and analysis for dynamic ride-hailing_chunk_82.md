I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

In Table 4, we compare the improved quality of the solutions
with the increased costs caused by longer repositioning distances. The
nearest strategy is always used as a reference point with which the
strategy under consideration is aligned. In the top part of the table, the
additional kilometers driven without customers (setup + repositioning)
in relation to the number of additional requests served are shown. Please note for reference that the average distance traveled without
customers in the nearest strategy is between 0.6 and 1.2 km per served
request. The average driving distance between the pickup and drop-off
location of a request is about 3.3 km. In the bottom part, the additional
kilometers driven without customers in relation to the seconds of
reduced average waiting time (over all served requests) are shown. High values indicate high additional costs, while low values indicate
low additional costs for additionally served requests or reduced waiting
time.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

1. **Simulation Methodology:** The text mentions simulation using "spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network" as one of the methodologies used in Ho et al.'s (2018) survey on dial-a-ride problems.
2. **Deep Learning Approach:** There is no explicit mention of deep learning approaches like Geng et al. (2019)'s spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network or Jiao et al. (2021)'s real-world ride-hailing vehicle repositioning using deep RL, but it does reference them indirectly.
3. **Parameters and Conditions:**
	* The text does not explicitly state any numerical parameters such as costs, distances, or waiting times.
	* However, the context implies that the solutions are evaluated based on their impact on cost, which suggests a focus on economic efficiency.

**Context Connection and Building Upon Surrounding Context:**

1. **Summary of Previous Research:** The text provides a brief summary of previous research in ride-hailing systems, including dynamic dispatch and real-time management.
2. **Comparison with Nearest Strategy:** The comparison with the nearest strategy implies that the current approach is being evaluated against its own performance in terms of cost and efficiency.
3. **Repositioning Costs:** The text mentions the importance of considering repositioning costs when evaluating solutions, suggesting that a thorough analysis of economic impact is essential.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. **Contextual Clarity:** The text requires contextual clarity to understand the specific parameters and conditions mentioned.
2. **Familiarity with Ride-Hailing Systems:** The text assumes a certain level of familiarity with ride-hailing systems, including the concept of dynamic dispatch, repositioning, demand forecasting, and rebalancing strategies.

Overall, this section provides an overview of previous research in ride-hailing systems and highlights the importance of considering economic impact when evaluating solutions. It sets the stage for a comparison between different approaches, including the nearest strategy, and emphasizes the need for thorough analysis of cost and efficiency.
