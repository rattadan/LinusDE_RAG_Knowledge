## Source Context
*From: https://www.dydx.xyz/*

### Document Overview  
The content compares Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting their distinct goals, technical mechanisms, and historical contexts, emphasizing their roles as decentralized financial systems.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm for mining blocks and securing the network.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing protocols on Ethereum that automate transactions and eliminate intermediaries.  
- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Applications built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, leveraging smart contracts.  
- **Scarcity and Supply Limitation**: Bitcoin’s 21 million supply (a finite resource) and Ethereum’s native token (ETH) as a digital asset.  
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions**: Bitcoin’s original purpose as a global payment network.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Bitcoin’s PoW Mechanism**: Miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions, with rewards for solving puzzles every 10 minutes.  
- **Ethereum’s Smart Contracts**: Use code to automate processes (e.g., lending, borrowing) without intermediaries, such as Aave’s collateral monitoring and loan distribution.  
- **Supply Limits**: Bitcoin’s 21 million BTC supply ensures scarcity, while Ethereum’s ETH token is a native asset with no fixed supply.  
- **Transaction Times**: Bitcoin blocks are mined every 10 minutes, while Ethereum transactions incur gas fees based on network congestion.  

### Related Topics  
- **Blockchain Technology**: The foundational concepts of decentralized networks discussed in broader technical documentation.  
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: The role of Ethereum’s smart contracts in enabling DeFi protocols (e.g., Aave, Uniswap).  
- **Cryptocurrency Market Cap**: The comparison of Bitcoin’s dominance in market value vs. Ethereum’s focus on dApps and smart contracts.

Bitcoin versus Ethereum and gain a greater appreciation for the diversity of crypto projects.

From their beginnings, Bitcoin and Ethereum had different goals for blockchain technology. Itâs essential for new investors to review each cryptocurrencyâs history and learn the context behind their unique features.Â

Bitcoin is the oldest and most successful cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. In 2008, the mysterious cryptographer Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned Bitcoin as a global peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platform. Nakamoto used a consensus algorithm called âProof-of-Workâ (PoW) to broadcast, store, and confirm transactions without a central authority. Computers that join the Bitcoin protocol can âmineâ new BTC by solving complex mathematical problems every 10 minutes. The first computer to win this mini-math competition receives a BTC reward.

Although Bitcoin still functions as a digital payment network, it now has the status of âdigital gold.â Like physical gold, BTC is a scarce and desirable asset with a limited supply of only 21 million coins. For this reason, some investors view Bitcoin as a speculative âstore of valueâ investment, believing it will retain its value over time.

Ethereum is a blockchain project that aims to decentralize the Internet. Even though Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency (the Ether token), its primary goal has never been to replace Bitcoin. Instead, the Ethereum blockchain encourages developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) on top of its protocol with the help of âsmart contracts.â

Smart contracts are programs that execute commands without intermediaries. For example, a smart contract could detect when a user deposits collateral into a decentralized crypto lending app like Aave. In this case, smart contracts will automatically send the desired loan to the borrowerâs cryptocurrency wallet and monitor the value of the collateral.
