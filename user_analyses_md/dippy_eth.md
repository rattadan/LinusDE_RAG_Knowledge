Putting some tweets in the bigger context of intentions:
The tweets about "$MASK cult" and "30K+ cult members want price to 10X" suggest the author is trying to create hype and community around specific tokens to potentially drive their price up. The "shilling your 100X bags" tweet frames the author as someone who understands the speculative nature of crypto investing but still encourages it as a heroic activity.

The Bitcoin-related tweets suggest the author positions themselves as having market insight, claiming to understand when Bitcoin will break through resistance levels. The tweet about CPI data indicates frustration with macroeconomic factors affecting crypto prices and a desire to return to a time when crypto might have been more independent from traditional financial indicators.

The tweet where the author mentions "I started an info piece" suggests they're trying to position themselves as a content creator or analyst in the crypto space, curating information for their audience.

Overall, the author seems to be building a persona as a crypto analyst who understands both technical aspects and community dynamics, positioning themselves to attract followers who want speculative investment tips and who enjoy being part of a crypto "cult" or community. Their tweets appear designed to create excitement and engagement while presenting themselves as having unique market insight.
