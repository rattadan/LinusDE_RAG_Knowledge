## Eureka - Chunk 44

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Get User Addresses for all Required Chains Use the route to determine the chains for which you need to supply a user address (the source, destination, and all intermediate chains that require a recovery address for receiving tokens in case of a failure) TypeScript Copy let userAddresses = [] const requiredAddresses = route.requiredChainAddresses; // iterate over chain IDs for chains that require addresses for (const chainID of requiredAddresses) { // Check that the chain is an EVM chain if (parseInt(chainID)) { // use signer library to get address from wallet const chain = extractChain({ chains: Object.values(chains), id: parseInt(chainID) }); const evmWalletClient = createWalletClient({ chain: chain, transport: custom(window.ethereum!) }); const [address] = await client.requestAddresses(); // add to map userAddresses.append({address: address, chainID: chainID}) } else { // handle cosmos and SVM wallets -- not shown } }); return evmWalletClient; } â€‹ 4.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk explains the potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, particularly focusing on Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast.

**Technical Details:**

1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC):**
   - Potential for timeouts or slippage when sending tokens between chains.
   - Tokens may be returned to the source chain if these issues arise.
2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol):**
   - Potential for slow relaying, leading to timeouts.
   - Slippage issues are also possible.
3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP):**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service, which can be out of order, causing funds to become inaccessible.
4. **Hyperlane:**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs), with a multisig ISM that requires at least three validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
5. **Go Fast:**
   - Uses timeout mechanisms to ensure users do not lose their funds, including intent expiration and refund processes.

**Context:**

This chunk is part of a comprehensive overview document that provides potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. The context is that the document aims to educate developers and users on what to expect if something goes wrong during cross-chain transfers.

**Connection to or Building upon surrounding context:**

1. **Summary of key points:** This chunk summarizes the main points related to each protocol, which are discussed in the overall document overview.
2. **Additional insights:** The additional insights section provides further details and recommendations for each protocol, building upon the information presented earlier.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

The text does not explicitly mention specific requirements, conditions, or constraints for implementing these protocols. However, it is implied that developers should be aware of potential risks and implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to mitigate those risks. Additionally, the document mentions user education and risk management as recommendations for developers and users.

**Analysis:**

This chunk provides a technical explanation of common failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols. It identifies specific protocol details, such as timeouts, slippage, and attestation services, which are crucial for understanding potential risks and developing mitigation strategies. The analysis also highlights the importance of user education and risk management to ensure successful cross-chain transfers.

**Recommendations:**

The text recommends informing users about potential failure points, encouraging monitoring and preparedness, and implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications. These recommendations are designed to help developers and users prepare for and mitigate risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.
