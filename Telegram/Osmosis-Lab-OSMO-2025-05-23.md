## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. Let me go through each message step by step.

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's probably important to mention as a general support resource.

Then BasementNodes mentions "numia-data" and that the whole db is on Google BQ. So they're talking about using Numia or Google BigQuery for data access. 

randomluckyy and jasbanza are discussing checking wallet balance history, specifically looking at differences over time. jasbanza says there's no simple website, suggesting Numia or querying the chain directly. randomluckyy is new to Numia, so they might need guidance there.

Next, there's a conversation about transferring alloyed assets between Osmosis wallets. jasbanza mentions TFM but they don't have allBTC listed. BasementNodes says Daodao won't work if they're not cw20, and jasbanza suggests Daodao or Celatone. The conclusion here seems to be that Daodao might be an option, but with limitations.

Then joemonem asks about a proto.rs file for creating an LP pool via a smart contract call. kychuli responds by asking for specifics and offers to discuss further in DMs. Also, joemonem asks about a dev chat channel, which kychuli says to DM him.

Putting this all together, the key points are:

1. Support request directed to the official site.
2. Using Numia or Google BigQuery for historical wallet data.
3. Discussion on transferring assets, with Daodao and Celatone as possible solutions but with cw20 limitations.
4. joemonem's technical inquiry about proto.rs and dev channel, leading to a DM offer.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, so I'll structure it by topics and note the main decisions or suggestions. Avoid timestamps and focus on the content and outcomes.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **Support Request**: Users were directed to Osmosis' official support site (https://support.osmosis.zone) for assistance.  
2. **Historical Wallet Data**:  
   - For tracking wallet balances over time (e.g., USD Coin amounts on specific dates), querying via Numia or directly from the

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key subjects are.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's about visiting the official support site. That seems like a support resource, so maybe "official support site" is a topic here.

Then BasementNodes mentions "numia-data" and Google BigQuery. So Numia and Google BigQuery are likely topics. Another message from BasementNodes talks about querying the chain for wallet balances, which relates to blockchain data queries.

Randomluckyy is asking about tracking asset history and differences in amounts over time. That sounds like "asset history tracking" and "wallet balance differences". They also mention checking Numia, so that's another mention for Numia.

Jasbanza brings up Daodao and Celatone as possible solutions. So Daodao and Celatone are topics here. He also mentions transferring alloyed assets between Osmosis wallets, which would be "transferring alloyed assets".

Kychuli and Joemonem are discussing a proto.rs file for creating an LP pool from a smart contract call. That's related to "smart contract development" and "LP pool creation". Joemonem also asks about a dedicated dev chat channel, so "developer communication channels" is another topic.

Putting this all together, the main topics would be: official support site, Numia, Google BigQuery, asset history tracking, wallet balance differences, Daodao, Celatone, transferring alloyed assets, smart contract development, LP pool creation, developer communication channels. 

Wait, I should check if any topics are duplicates or can be grouped. For example, "Google BigQuery" is specific, so that's okay. "Transferring alloyed assets" refers to moving assets between wallets on Osmosis. The dev chat channel is a separate topic. I think that's all. Let me make sure each message is covered. Yeah, each key point seems captured. Now just list them separated by commas.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to read through the provided chat messages and figure out the overall sentiment. The user wants it categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.

Looking at the text, it's a series of messages from different users. The main conversation seems to be about technical topics related to Osmosis, like checking wallet balances, using specific tools (numia, daodao, celatone), and some issues with transferring assets. There's also a part about a support site link. 

Starting with the first message: the bot is offering help by directing to the support site. That's neutral, maybe positive since it's helpful. Then BasementNodes and others are discussing technical details. The user randomluckyy is asking about tracking asset history, and others are suggesting tools. There's some uncertainty, like "I don't think something like this exists" which might be negative, but then BasementNodes says "Nah I guess not" which is a bit dismissive but not overly negative. 

Other parts: "shoot me a dm" and "wanted to see if there's a proto.rs file" are requests or questions without clear positive or negative words. The sentiment here seems to be around problem-solving, which is neutral. There's no strong positive language like excitement or gratitude, nor strong negative like frustration or anger. 

Most messages are informational or inquiring about technical details. The only slightly negative part is when jasbanza says there used to be a way but now it doesn't exist, which might indicate some disappointment. But overall, the conversation is focused on finding solutions, so maybe neutral. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any sarcasm or context. Words like "Nah" are casual but not necessarily negative. The user asking if a dapp exists and others suggesting options without negative words. The support message is positive but the rest is neutral. 

Considering all, the sentiment is neutral. There's no strong positive or negative emotions; it's mostly technical discussion and problem-solving attempts.
</think>

The sentiment of this text is **neutral**. 

The conversation primarily revolves around technical discussions, problem-solving, and information sharing related to Osmosis and blockchain tools (e.g., Numia, Daodao). While there are moments of uncertainty (e.g., "I don't think something like this exists"), there is no overt positivity (e.g., enthusiasm, gratitude)

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's anything that indicates a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a next step in a process.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a link to their support site. That seems like a suggestion or help, but not an action item. Maybe just a reference.

Then BasementNodes mentions under 'numia-data' and that their DB is on Google BQ. Not sure if that's an action, maybe a note for someone to check that folder or database. But unless there's a specific task tied to it, maybe not an action item.

randomluckyy talks about checking wallet balances on specific dates. The previous messages from jasbanza and BasementNodes discuss using numia or querying the chain. randomluckyy says they'll check numia. So here, the action item is for randomluckyy to check numia for wallet history.

jasbanza asks if there's a DApp for transferring alloyed assets, mentioning TFM and asking BasementNodes. Then BasementNodes and jasbanza discuss Daodao and Celatone as possible solutions. So the next step here might be to explore Daodao or Celatone for the transfer.

kychuli and joemonem's messages: joemonem asks about a proto.rs file for creating an LP pool via smart contract. kychuli responds to DM them. So the action item here is for kychuli to send a DM to joemonem, and joemonem should follow up by checking the DM.

Also, joemonem asks if there's a dedicated dev chat channel. That's a question, so maybe the next step is to find or establish such a channel, but unless someone commits to doing that, maybe not. However, since kychuli responds with "shoot me a dm," perhaps the action is to communicate via DM for further assistance.

Putting it all together, the main action items are:

1. randomluckyy to check Numia for wallet balance history.
2. jasbanza and BasementNodes to explore Daodao or Celatone for transferring alloyed assets.
3. kychuli to send a DM to joemonem regarding the proto.rs file and LP pool creation.
4.
