## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through all the messages and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on decisions and main points.

Starting from the top, Me37284... mentions holding OSMO long-term, bought a lot and never sold. So that's a strong hold stance. Then James_Mndoza says long-term definitely more and higher, so he's bullish. Erikplum2 talks about reaching $1.50 in March 2024, and mentions it's the same cycle as before, expecting $3-4. He also references Trump's inauguration, which might be a factor for him. 

GPKwee forwards a complaint, and JKlol1 wants to start a petition because they can't deposit Passage to Osmosis anymore, only through third-party services. They're frustrated with the UX changes. Another user, Mrtiahou, complains about the web app being bad for mobile trading and wants a mobile app with better charts. Griffin_web3 explains that Osmosis works with wallets like Keplr and connects via IBC, which is a key feature. 

There's a mention of expiring authz by griffin_web3, so users might need to reauthorize. Amir5910 asks about 1-click trading, which might be a feature someone explained earlier. Pluralizes asks if staking OSMO gets airdrops, which is a common question. The statbot links support sites and official wallet info. Erikplum2 again says cycles repeat, nothing changed. 

Mrtiahou also mentions using CEX for trading and Osmo for staking because of UX issues. The main issues here are the deposit problems with Passage, the lack of a mobile app, and the user experience on mobile. Also, some users are bullish on OSMO's price, expecting higher values. 

Decisions might include the need for a mobile app, addressing the deposit issue, and handling complaints. But the text doesn't show any decisions made, just user discussions. So the summary should highlight the key opinions, price expectations, UX complaints, and the deposit problem. Also note the use of wallets like Keplr and the IBC functionality. Avoid the links and just mention the resources. 

I need to structure this concisely. Start with the price expectations and holding strategies, then move to user complaints about

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user provided a list of chat messages related to Osmosis, which seems to be a decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Cosmos ecosystem. My task is to identify the key topics discussed here and list them as a comma-separated string.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The earliest message is from vta108 saying "To the moon...". That's a common phrase in crypto communities indicating they expect the price to rise a lot. So maybe "Price predictions" or "Crypto market speculation" is a topic.

Next, osmosis_statbot shares support links. That's about support resources, so maybe "Support resources" or "Official support channels". Then Pluralizes asks about staking OSMO and airdrops. That's related to staking benefits and airdrops, so "Staking eligibility for airdrops".

amir5910 asks about "1 click trading", which is a feature topic. Then griffin_web3 mentions expiring authz and needing to add again, which might be about authorization or technical issues. But maybe "Authorization issues" or "Technical limitations".

Mrtiahou has several messages. They mention not wanting another wallet, UX issues, wanting a mobile app like Binance or Dydx, and frustration with the web app. Topics here could be "User experience (UX) complaints", "Mobile app demand", "Desire for centralized exchange features".

griffin_web3 responds by talking about using wallets like Keplr and Leap, connecting to Cosmos chains via IBC. So "IBC integration", "Wallet integration (Keplr, Leap)", "Cosmos ecosystem connectivity".

Mrtiahou again mentions the web app not being mobile, so reinforcing the mobile app topic. griffin_web3 mentions mobile app advanced charts, so "Mobile app functionality".

Mrtiahou complains about the mobile app's charts and wanting a better one. Then griffin_web3 talks about Osmosis being a decentralized DEX and hub for Cosmos, so "Decentralized exchange (DEX) role", "Cosmos ecosystem hub".

Other messages: Me372... talks about buying OSMO at certain prices and holding, so "OSMO token investment strategies", "Long-term holding". Erikplum2 mentions price targets ($3-4), previous cycles, MC of crypto,

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Then, I'll summarize the overall sentiment.

Starting with the first message: "I hope so, i got both of them bought a lot and never sold" ‚Äì The user is hopeful and mentions holding investments without selling. "Hope so" and the context of holding suggest a positive sentiment, but there's some uncertainty. Maybe neutral? Or positive because they're optimistic about the future?

Next: "Long term deff more and way higher" ‚Äì Definitely positive. The user is bullish on OSMO long-term.

Third message: "It reached $1.50 March 2024! Be thankful you bought under $1. This is my 3rd cycle seen it all before, heard the BS ALL BEFORE. Nothing has changed cycle exactly the same" ‚Äì The user is pointing out a past price and expressing frustration with the same cycle. Words like "BS" and "heard it all before" indicate negative sentiment.

"Anyway, I have forwarded your complaint." ‚Äì Neutral. Just a statement without clear positive or negative words.

"Awe well I hope more people complain about this and it gets changed back. Let the devs know. I could prob get a big petition signed. Doesn‚Äôt seem plausible." ‚Äì The user hopes for change but acknowledges it's not plausible. The mention of complaints and a petition suggests dissatisfaction, so negative.

"I think the devs have their reasons too, unfortunately I don't know what the reasons are, sorry ser, lol" ‚Äì Neutral with a slight positive note because they're giving the devs the benefit of the doubt but unsure.

"So now osmosis has an extra website to connect to just to transfer? lol how do we file a complaint üòÖ" ‚Äì The user is frustrated with the extra steps, using "lol" and üòÖ which might indicate sarcasm. Negative sentiment.

"IBC was made for a reason lol" ‚Äì The "lol" here could be dismissive, indicating frustration. Negative.

"That‚Äôs horrible no way" ‚Äì Definitely negative. Strong words like "horrible" show clear dissatisfaction.

"new features üòÜ" ‚Äì The üòÜ emoji adds context. It's sarcastic, so negative.

"Ye when i buy osmo at 0,2 0,5 0,8  im buyin with the safety that 1.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any that indicate a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a plan for the future.

Starting from the top, Me3728482... says they bought a lot and never sold. That's more of a statement about their current holdings, not an action item. James_Mndoza's message about long-term prices being higher might be a prediction, but not an action. Erikplum2 mentions the cycle and past experiences, again more of an opinion.

GPKwee at 22:27:19 says they've forwarded a complaint. That's an action item because they took a step to forward it. Then JKlol1 talks about getting a petition signed and complaining to devs. That's a next step they're planning. The user also asks how to file a complaint, which might be a request for action.

Another message from JKlol1 mentions issues with depositing Passage tokens, which could indicate a problem needing resolution. GPKwee mentions devs have reasons for changes but doesn't know them, so maybe someone needs to find out. The user then asks about a mobile app and the response says they use Keplr or Leap, so maybe there's an action to check those wallets.

Looking at griffin_web3's messages, they provide links to check stats and mention using Keplr. Those links could be resources for others. Erikplum2 predicts prices reaching $3-4, which is a forecast but not an action. Me3728482... talks about their investment strategy, which is a decision but not an explicit action item.

James_Mndoza asks about the number of OSMO holders, which might require someone to check the stats links provided earlier. The statbot messages are just links to support sites and official pages. Mrtiahou complains about the UX and wanting a mobile app, which could lead to a next step of developing or improving the app. griffin_web3 mentions using mobile apps like Keplr, so maybe the action is to use those wallets.

Other messages include users expressing frustration with the current setup, suggesting they might need to switch to a mobile wallet. The part about expiring authz from griffin_web3 indicates a need to reauthorize
