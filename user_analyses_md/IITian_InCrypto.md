There are some red flags here that suggest this might not be a fully legitimate account:

Emotional patterns and tendencies:

Putting these tweets in the bigger context of the account's intentions:
These tweets appear to be part of a strategy to position the account as a source of timely information about crypto airdrop opportunities. The account is likely trying to attract followers who are interested in claiming free tokens, and may be monetizing this audience either through direct promotions or by building influence in the crypto space. The account name referencing IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) suggests an attempt to leverage academic credibility to gain trust, which is common in the crypto space where verification and trust are challenging.
