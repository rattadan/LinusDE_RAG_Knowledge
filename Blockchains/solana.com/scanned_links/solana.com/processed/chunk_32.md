# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_32.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://solana.com/*

### Document Overview  
This document explains Solana's program model, including how programs are structured, managed, and verified, with focus on their role in the network and tools for deployment and verification.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Program Accounts**: Stateless accounts containing executable code, organized into functions (instructions).  
- **Upgrade Authority**: A mechanism to update programs, which becomes immutable once removed.  
- **Verifiable Builds**: A feature allowing users to verify program code against its on-chain representation using tools like the Verifiable Build CLI.  
- **Anchor Framework**: A Rust-based framework for writing Solana programs, offering reduced boilerplate code and faster development.  
- **Native Rust**: Alternative approach for writing programs without frameworks, offering flexibility but requiring more complexity.  
- **Program Management Commands**: Actions like deploy, close, redeploy, and transfer authority for programs.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Program Structure**: Programs are stateless but can create/modify other accounts (e.g., storing data).  
- **Upgrade Authority**: Users can transfer control (e.g., `transfer_authority`) to update programs.  
- **Verifiable Builds**: Uses the Solana Verifiable Build CLI (via Ellipsis Labs) to verify program code against its on-chain representation.  
- **Anchor Framework**: Includes built-in support for verifiable builds, with examples of Rust macros for simplifying code.  
- **Deployment Commands**:  
  - `deploy` to create a new program.  
  - `close` to terminate a program.  
  - `redeploy/upgrade` to replace existing programs.  
  - `transfer_authority` to change control.  

### Related Topics  
- **Solana Account Model**: Described in the document, linking to the broader account system.  
- **Verifiable Build CLI**: Connected to the documentâ€™s focus on program verification.  
- **Anchor Documentation**: Mentioned as a key resource for program development.  
- **Solana Explorer**: Referred to as a tool for searching verified programs (e.g., example link provided).

The Solana cluster genesis includes a list of special programs that provide core
functionalities for the network. Historically these were referred to as "native"
programs and they used to be distributed together with the validator code.

- Programs are accounts containingexecutable code, organized into functions
calledinstructions.
- While programs arestateless, they can include instructions that create
and update other accounts to store data.
- Anupgrade authoritycan update programs. Once this authority is removed,
the program becomes immutable.
- Users can verify an on-chain program account's data matches its public source
code through verifiable builds.
- Anchor: A framework designed for Solana
program development. It provides a faster and simpler way to write programs,
using Rust macros to reduce boilerplate code. For beginners, it is recommended
to start with the Anchor framework.
- Native Rust: This approach involves writing Solana
programs in Rust without leveraging any frameworks. It offers more flexibility
but comes with increased complexity.
- Searching for Verified Programs: To quickly check for verified programs,
users can search for a program address onSolana Explorer. View an example of a verified
programhere.
- Verification Tools: TheSolana Verifiable Build CLIby Ellipsis Labs enables users to independently verify on-chain programs
against published source code.
- Support for Verifiable Builds in Anchor: Anchor provides built-in support
for verifiable builds. Details can be found in theAnchor documentation.
- Deploy a new program or buffer
- Close a program or buffer
- Redeploy / upgrade an existing program
- Transfer the authority over a program
- Finalize a program
