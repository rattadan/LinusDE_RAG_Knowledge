# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_5.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.avax.network/*

### Document Overview  
This content provides essential information about Avalanche's validator statistics, staking mechanics, and related features, including total stake, APR, and hardware requirements.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Staking**: Locking AVAX to secure the network and earn rewards.  
- **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**: Annualized return on staked AVAX, calculated as 7.60% (daily: 0.71, monthly: 0.71, yearly: 8.58).  
- **Delegated Stake**: AVAX locked by other validators to support the network.  
- **Staking Ratio**: 56.16% of total AVAX is staked, indicating network decentralization.  
- **Staking Calculator**: Tool to estimate APR based on AVAX stake and delegation.  
- **No Slashing**: Avalanche’s staking mechanism ensures tokens are never at risk of slashing.  
- **Low Hardware Requirements**: Minimal computational resources required for node operation.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Staking Rewards**: Earn up to 7.65% APY by staking AVAX, with customizable fee parameters for delegations.  
- **APY Calculations**: Daily rate (0.71) is calculated as (7.60% / 365) * 100, monthly (0.71) as (7.60% / 12) * 100, and yearly (8.58) as (7.60% * 365) / 12.  
- **Total Stake**: 247,602,350 AVAX (56.16% staked), with 1,724 validators and 161,835 delegations.  
- **Staking Calculator**: Displays "Your Avalanche (AVAX) Stake" and "Staking Rewards" in USD (e.g., $0.32 daily, $11.37 monthly, $137.45 yearly).  
- **Hardware Requirements**: Lightweight, requiring minimal equipment (no specialized hardware).  

### Related Topics  
- **Validator FAQ**: Links to detailed guides on staking, node setup, and network security.  
- **Node Setup**: Connected to the "Add Node to Validator Set" section, emphasizing low hardware requirements.  
- **Security Features**: Notes the "No Slashing" policy, which is a technical distinction from other blockchains.  
- **APY Calculations**: References the "Staking Calculator" and "Annual Percentage Yield" section, tying to the main content.
