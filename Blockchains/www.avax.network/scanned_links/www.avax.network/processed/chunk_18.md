# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_18.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.avax.network/*

### Document Overview  
The content highlights Avalanche's initiatives, tools, and programs supporting developers, including funding for codebases, blockchain protocols, and interoperability solutions, while emphasizing advancements in off-chain computation, databases, and API integrations.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **infraBUIDL (AI)**: A developer funding program with $15M to build tools and infrastructure for Avalanche.  
- **Codebase Incubator**: A program for early-stage projects, featuring Season 2 winners and applications.  
- **Firewood**: A high-throughput database optimized for blockchain scalability.  
- **Frosty**: A consensus protocol with strong liveness guarantees.  
- **NodeKit**: A sequencer L1 framework using HyperSDK for shared sequencer infrastructure.  
- **Graph**: Tools for Avalanche developers to expand data integration.  
- **Avalanche Foundation**: Initiatives like the Glacier API beta and off-chain computation services.  
- **HyperSDK**: A framework for building blockchain tools and sequencers.  

### Implementation Details  
- **infraBUIDL Program**: $15M in developer funding for tools, infrastructure, and open-source projects.  
- **NodeKit Pre-Seed Round**: $1.2M to build a shared sequencer L1 with HyperSDK.  
- **Firewood Database**: Designed for high-throughput blockchains, optimized for performance and scalability.  
- **Avalanche Fuji**: Chainlink functions now live here, enabling API integration for Web3.  
- **Glacier API Beta**: A tool for developers to build and deploy blockchain applications.  
- **Codebase Incubator Season 2**: Applications for next-gen Web3 founders building on Avalanche.  

### Related Topics  
- **Codebase by Avalanche**: A developer accelerator for early-stage projects, linked to the codebase incubator.  
- **Avalanche Foundation Programs**: Connections to infraBUIDL, Glacier API, and off-chain computation initiatives.  
- **HyperSDK and Sequencer L1**: Details in NodeKit’s infrastructure and the codebase incubator’s tooling.  
- **Interoperability**: Links to the Movement SDK (Movement Labs) and the Graph’s data tools.
