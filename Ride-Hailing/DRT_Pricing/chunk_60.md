schemes, the number of DRT trips increases to a lesser extent, which is explained by the limited number of available
DRT vehicles (see in particular 3a).

It seems you've provided a citation or an academic paper rather than asking for information. However, I can still provide you with an answer based on your request.

If we assume that the question is actually asking about the impact of increasing the number of residents inside the service area by a factor of 4 and then increasing the number of DRT trips by a factor of 10, without specifying the pricing schemes, it's difficult to provide a specific answer.

However, if I had to make an educated guess based on general knowledge, here are two possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: If the service area is limited in some way (e.g., it's a small town with only a few streets), increasing the number of residents inside the service area by a factor of 4 might lead to a proportional increase in DRT trips due to the increased demand for services.

Scenario 2: On the other hand, if the service area is relatively large and has many potential customers (e.g., it's a busy urban area with many shops, restaurants, and businesses), increasing the number of residents inside the service area by a factor of 4 might lead to an increase in DRT trips due to increased demand for services from these new residents.

In terms of specific pricing schemes, without knowing more about them, it's difficult to say how much the price would increase or decrease. However, if we assume that there are other factors at play (e.g., limited capacity of vehicles), increasing the number of residents inside the service area by a factor of 4 might lead to an increase in DRT trips due to increased demand for services.

If you have any further information about the pricing schemes or specific scenarios, I'd be happy to try and provide a more detailed answer.
