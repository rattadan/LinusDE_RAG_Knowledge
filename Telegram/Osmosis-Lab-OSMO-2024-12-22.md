## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different users on Osmosis. 

First, I'll go through each message to understand the context. The earliest message is from Osmosis_statbot repeating the support site link. Then there's a conversation about bridges not working for withdrawing SOL, specifically Picasso Bridge. The user The_Sheriff_Of_Tombstone is having trouble with that. Kychuli responds that they likely have an alloy token and need to swap to bridge token via 1:1 no-fee swaps. They mention using Portal, and WestbankTrash links to skip.build.

Then Danison410 is asking about setting up an interview with the Osmosis team for a YouTube channel. Kychuli directs them to Davidjgoosey. 

There's a question from cryptologer0 about how the Polaris app helps Osmosis growth. Khuwarzmi shares a quote from Davidgoosey explaining that Polaris and Osmosis are separate, but Polaris brings more users (top of funnel) and targets a bigger market, which benefits Osmosis as a liquidity layer. User_343756695 adds that Polaris could drive OSMO purchases through its narrative.

Other messages include cloudune's comments about Bitcoin being the intranet and wanting to build off-grid sites, WombRaider's frustration with swapping assets without CEX, suggesting using Rango or SquidRouter, but GPKwee notes Squid doesn't support Cosmos-Solana swaps yet. OleksiyK suggests trying Noble Express for USDC. WombRaider considers selling everything for land and gold due to internet issues in Melbourne.

So key points are:
1. Support requests about bridges not working for SOL withdrawal, solution involves swapping alloy tokens via specific bridges (Portal, Skip.build) with no fees.
2. Interview request from Infinite Crypto, directed to Davidjgoosey.
3. Explanation of Polaris app's role in driving Osmosis growth by expanding market and liquidity.
4. User frustrations with cross-chain swaps (Cosmos to Solana) and considering CEX as a workaround.
5. Technical advice on using Noble Express, SquidRouter, Rango for transfers.
6. Off-topic comments about Bitcoin as intranet and personal decisions to exit

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects discussed.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a recurring reminder to visit the support site. That's about Support Resources. Then kychuli mentions directing inquiries to someone, so that's Team Contact. Danison410 talks about an interview request from a YouTube channel founder, which relates to Media Collaboration. 

Looking at the next set, there's a discussion about using the bridge front ends and alloy tokens. The user is having trouble with bridges, specifically withdrawing SOL via Picasso Bridge. So topics here are Bridge Usage Issues and SOL Withdrawal Problems. The_Sheriff_Of_Tombstone and others mention using Portal for bridges, which is another Bridge Front End Mention. WestbankTrash shares a link to Skip.build, which might be a bridge service, so that's a Bridge Service Mention as well.

jamesrizor praises depositing BTC via BITMOSIS, so that's a Positive Feedback on BTC Deposits. Another statbot message reiterates the support site, again Support Resources. user_343756695 discusses Polaris contributing to Osmo's narrative, which is Polaris App Impact. Khuwarzmi shares a Telegram link for Polaris and quotes Davidgoosey on the relationship between Osmosis and Polaris, so those are part of Polaris Collaboration and Osmosis-Polaris Integration.

cryptologer0 asks how Polaris will help Osmosis, so that's another Polaris App Impact. Then cloudune's messages about Bitcoin as an intranet and saving REGEN for off-grid communities touch on Bitcoin Analogy and Off-Grid Community Development. WombRaider complains about internet issues in Melbourne and plans to sell crypto for land and gold, which is Internet Infrastructure Criticism and Investment Strategy Shift. 

Cosmodon's comment on the "retarded way" being the right way here might relate to User Experience Criticism. OleksiyK suggests trying Noble Express for USDC transfers, which is USDC Transfer Methods. WombRaider and GPKwee discuss using SquidRouter and CEX for swaps, leading to Cosmos-Solana Swap Limitations and CEX Usage Preference.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a series of chat messages from different people discussing Osmosis and related topics. I need to go through each message and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot: "If you need help, visit our official support site..." That's a standard support message, so neutral. Next, kychuli says directing inquiries to someone, which is also neutral. Danison410 is asking about an interview, positive because they want to promote the team. 

Then another statbot message, again neutral. Kychuli again, telling someone to open a support ticket, still neutral. The_Sheriff_Of_Tombstone thanks them and says they'll let them know, which is positive. 

The next few messages are about technical issues. Kychuli explains using bridge tokens, and The_Sheriff says it doesn't work. That's negative. WestbankTrash shares a link, but no sentiment there, so neutral. Kychuli mentions using portal, which is neutral. The_Sheriff is frustrated with bridges not working, definitely negative. 

Jamesrizor praises depositing BTC, so positive. More statbot messages, neutral. User_343756695 talks about Polaris contributing to Osmo, positive. Khuwarzmi shares a Telegram link and quotes Davidgoosey explaining the Osmosis-Polaris relationship, which is neutral. Cryptologer0 asks how Polaris helps Osmosis, neutral. 

Cloudune's messages about intranet and Bitcoin seem neutral or maybe positive if they're supportive, but since they're just statements, probably neutral. WombRaider's messages are negative, complaining about internet issues and difficulty swapping. OleksiyK suggests trying USDC, neutral. Cosmodon says the retarded way is right, negative. 

GPKwee mentions swaps not supported yet, negative. WombRaider again frustrated, negative. GPKwee suggests SquidRouter, neutral. Then GPKwee says using CEX is easier, which might be a negative towards Osmosis. WombRaider's final message is negative about the process being retarded.

Now, tallying up. Positive messages: Danison410, jamesrizor, The_Sheriff's thanks, user_34375

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message one by one to see if there's anything that needs to be done or a decision made.

Starting from the top, osmosis_statbot and kychuli mention visiting the support site and directing inquiries to @davidjgoosey. Danison410 is asking about setting up an interview with the Osmosis team. That seems like a potential action item because someone needs to respond to him and assign a contact. Then there's a lot of back-and-forth between The_Sheriff_Of_Tombstone and kychuli about bridges not working, specifically for withdrawing SOL. Kychuli suggests using a portal and swapping tokens, so maybe the next step here is for The_Sheriff to try those methods. 

Looking at other messages, jamesrizor praises BITMOSIS, which might not be an action item. Then there's a discussion about Polaris and its connection to Osmosis, but that's more informational. The user_343756695 and Khuwarzmi talk about how Polaris contributes to Osmo's narrative, which seems like a decision point but maybe not an immediate action. 

Further down, cloudune mentions saving REGEN for off-grid sites, so that could be an action item if someone needs to follow up. WombRaider and others are frustrated with bridges and swapping, so OleksiyK suggests trying 1 USDC first via Noble express. GPKwee recommends using SquidRouter or CEX. WombRaider's next step would be to try those options. 

I need to make sure I don't miss any explicit requests or tasks. Danison410's message is a clear request for contact information to set up an interview. The_Sheriff_Of_Tombstone's issue with bridges requires a solution, so kychuli's advice to swap to bridge token is a next step. Also, OleksiyK's suggestion to test with 1 USDC is actionable. Cloudune's offer to save REGEN might be an action item for someone else to take him up on it. 

I should list each of these points, ensuring they're phrased as actions or decisions. Avoid including general comments or frustrations unless they lead to a
