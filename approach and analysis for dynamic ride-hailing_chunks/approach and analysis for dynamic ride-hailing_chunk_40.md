customer requests. In Section 5.1, we present the used strategies that
were taken from the literature. In Section 5.2, we identify conceptual
weaknesses of the benchmark approaches and introduce our own repositioning approach—originally designed for the DIMACS Implementation
Challenge—which addresses these weaknesses by explicitly considering
dynamically created, driving time-related, overlapping zones around
the available parking lots. derived from their practical application, it is reasonable to still match
the remaining vehicles and requests and send the vehicles to the locations of their respective matched requests. If, e.g., a customer decides
to wait slightly longer than the maximum waiting time defined by the
system, service could still be provided.
