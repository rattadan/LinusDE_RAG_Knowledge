## Chunk 49

**Original Text:**

If they successfully submit the cancel message before
T2, they will be able to retain 0.7 of their initial deposit. If they submit the cancel message after T2, they
will only be able to retain 0.5 of their initial deposit. By providing an incentive for the counterparty to disclose their secret code, the escrow mechanism helps to ensure that both parties are able to recover at least a
portion of their initial deposit in case of a cancellation. How does the escrow system protect against bots programmed to automatically accept or request
pickups without fulfilling commitments? If a bot accepts or requests pickups automatically without fulfilling its commitments, it will likely be unable
to recover its initial deposit from the escrow account.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The escrow system in this scenario appears to have several built-in safeguards to prevent bots from exploiting loopholes and ensuring that both parties can recover their initial deposits if cancellations occur.

1. **Conditional Retention**: The system allows for a 0.7 (or 70%) retention of the initial deposit if the cancel message is submitted before T2, while retaining only 0.5 (or 50%) if it's submitted after T2. This provides an incentive for parties to comply with the agreed-upon terms.

2. **Escrow Account Management**: The system likely has a mechanism in place to monitor and track escrow accounts, which can help identify suspicious activity, such as bots requesting pickups without fulfilling their commitments. If a bot attempts to do so, it may trigger alerts or notifications that can be investigated by the party monitoring the account.

3. **Verification Process**: To further prevent exploitation, the system might have a verification process in place where the escrow agent (potentially an independent third-party) verifies the identity of the counterparty and ensures they are who they claim to be. If the verification fails or the bot is found to be impersonating the actual party, it could limit its ability to recover deposits.

4. **Account Segregation**: Escrow accounts often involve separating funds from other assets or accounts, which can help if a bot tries to manipulate the system by transferring funds from these accounts into their own.

5. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Regular monitoring and auditing of escrow accounts can help identify potential issues before they become major problems, including those that might be exploited by bots.

By incorporating these measures, the escrow system provides a robust mechanism for protecting both parties' interests and ensuring that deposits are recovered in case of cancellation or non-compliance.
