## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 28

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

Figure 2 Trip Modal Shares across Varying-Density-Focused Scenarios Simulated with DRS for
Bloomington
Table 2 documents scenario-specific fleet metrics, such as the average SAV idling time over a 24
hr day, person-trips served per SAV per day, average fleet VMT per SAV per day and the
average travel time while choosing the SAV mode to travel. All metrics shown here for
Bloomington, Illinois are higher than typically found in shared fleet studies and is likely
attributed to the relatively small 74 sq. mi region. Average trip length in Bloomington is about
one-third that of NHTSâ€™ U.S. average of 12 mi but may be skewed right from long and frequent
trips in megaregions. On average, SAVs for the fixed demand-to-supply ratio stay idle about
two-thirds the day, irrespective of stop aggregation and DRS. A smaller fleet can be used
intensively to lower idling time and improve average person-trips served per SAV, but this
comes at the cost of higher response times.
