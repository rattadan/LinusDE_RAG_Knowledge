## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions.

Looking at the messages, there's a lot about Osmosis and Polaris. The main topics seem to be emission rate changes, staking APRs, wallet issues, and discussions about the future of the platform. Let me break it down.

The emission rate was reduced from 9.1% to 6.06% on June 20, 2025. That's a big deal because users were asking about when the cut would happen. Some people are disappointed that the APR dropped, like Sordisol seeing 22% on Atomic Wallet and others at 11.12% or 11%. But Czarcas7ic and others mention that wallets use rolling averages, so it might take time to update.

There's a mention of the "thirdening" event causing lower emissions for liquidity providers and stakers. Users like aqui7a are concerned about a 25% drop in staking rewards despite validators keeping APR the same. The team is working on backend improvements, not abandoning Osmosis, as JohnnyWyles87 and GPKwee clarify. They're focusing on Polaris, which is supposed to be a better frontend and could drive growth for OSMO, possibly even more than current DEXs.

Discussions about tokenomics: user_319582897 suggests moving towards deflation with token burns, comparing OSMO to CAKE and Uni. GPKwee mentions that Osmosis fundamentals are strong and the price will reach market equilibrium eventually. Also, there's a potential revenue share from Polaris to OSMO holders, which user_343756695 thinks makes OSMO valuation include both Osmosis and Polaris potential.

Technical issues: some users are having trouble with Revolut not supporting OSMO withdrawals yet, so they can't transfer to Keplr. Also, UI improvements are suggested for Osmosis, like detailed charts and leveraged trading.

Other points: Solana adopting Cosmos SDK, competition among DEXs, and the idea that DEXs will become backends while aggregators take the front end. The team is still building, but it's backend work which isn't as visible

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or topics.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a support link, so maybe "official support site" is a topic, but that's probably not a main topic. The rest of the messages seem to be discussing things like staking APR, emission rate changes, Polaris, Osmosis UI changes, token valuation, comparisons with other DEXs, Solana deployment, and user concerns about price drops and inflation. 

Looking at messages from Czarcas7ic and others, they mention rolling averages for wallets and needing time for updates. That might relate to "wallet staking APR updates". Sordisol and user_5462303026 talk about APR on Atomic Wallet and checking app updates, so "APR discrepancies" could be a topic. 

The user_5462303026 also mentions RDR vibes, which I'm not familiar with, but maybe it's a reference to a game (Red Dead Redemption?), so perhaps "RDR vibes" is a topic, though it might be a minor one. 

osmosis_news shares a link, but without the content of the link, it's hard to say. Maybe not a main topic. The discussion about the "thirdening" by kychuli refers to a drop in emissions for LP/staking, so "emission rate reduction" is a key point here. 

aqui7a asks about a 25% decrease in staking rewards despite validators' APR staying the same, which ties into emission changes. Oxletian's messages are about the Osmo price drop and seeking explanations. 

davidjgoosey talks about thoughts on Osmosis and Polaris, linking to a tweet. Glonken mentions targeting liquidity and deploying on Solana. Waterspinner discusses Solana adopting Cosmos SDK and interchain. 

user_343756695 and GPKwee have several messages about Polaris, its relation to Osmo, revenue sharing, and how it's a priority over Osmosis mobile. They also mention APR changes, market equilibrium, token valuation comparisons with CAKE, UNI, etc.,

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people discussing Osmosis, Polaris, staking rewards, emission rates, and the price of OSMO. I need to go through each message and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, looking at the osmosis_statbot messages, they're just providing support links. That's neutral because they're informational and not expressing any emotion.

Czarcas7ic mentions wallets using rolling averages. Neutral, since it's a factual statement about how wallets update.

user_5462303026 tells someone to check for an app update. Neutral again, just a suggestion without clear positive or negative emotion.

Sordisol is surprised about a 22% APR on Atomic Wallet. The question "How is that possible?" might indicate confusion or skepticism, so maybe negative? But not sure. Could be positive if they're excited, but the tone seems more like concern.

Another user_5462303026 says "love the RDR vibes =]". The smiley and "love" make this positive.

osmosis_news shares a link. Neutral, just sharing content.

user_5462303026 thanks GPKwee and mentions DCA. The gratitude is positive, and encouraging others to double down suggests optimism.

The next messages about APR on Keplr and the thirdening event causing emission drops. Neutral, stating facts.

aqui7a asks about a 25% decrease in rewards. Negative, as they're concerned about the drop.

Oxletian's messages are very emotional with emojis like üôèüèªü•∫üò≠ and "We are so tired" and questions about the price drop. Definitely negative.

Glonken and waterspinner discuss technical aspects like targeting liquidity and Solana adopting Cosmos SDK. Neutral.

user_343756695 and GPKwee talk about Polaris, revenue sharing, and market equilibrium. Mixed. Some positive mentions of potential but also concerns about valuation and delays. Need to parse each one.

user_319582897 criticizes the UI, mentions friends hating Osmosis, and calls for deflation. Negative.

JohnnyWyles87 and others discuss emission rate changes. Some positive about lower

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify any explicit or implicit actions that need to be taken, decisions made, or steps to follow.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot: it's a link to the support site. That's just a support notice, no action item here. Then Czarcas7ic mentions wallets using rolling averages and needing time to update. This seems like a note for users to be patient, so maybe an action item to "Allow time for wallet APR updates due to rolling averages."

Next, user_5462303026 tells someone to check their app update for Atomic Wallet. So the action here is to "Check for app updates on Atomic Wallet to ensure accurate APR display." Sordisol is asking about a 22% APR on Atomic Wallet, so that's a question but not an action item. The user_5462303026 again mentions RDR vibes, which is just a comment.

osmosis_news shares a link, which is informational. Then user_5462303026 thanks GPKwee and mentions DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging), so maybe an action item to "Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) as a strategy during market downturns." They also mention seeing 11.12% APR on Keplr, which is a data point but not an action.

kychuli refers to the 'thirdening' event causing emissions drop. This might indicate a decision was made to reduce emissions, so "Emissions for liquidity providers and stakers have been reduced following the 'thirdening' event." Then aqui7a asks about a 25% decrease in staking rewards, which is a question but the answer might be the emission rate change mentioned by JohnnyWyles87 later.

Oxletian's messages are emotional reactions, not actionable items. Davidjgoosey shares a link about thoughts on Osmosis and Polaris, which is informational. Glonken talks about targeting liquidity and deploying on Solana, so maybe "Explore opportunities to target liquidity on other platforms or ecosystems, such as Solana." Waterspinner's messages are opinions on Solana adopting Cosmos SDK, which could be
