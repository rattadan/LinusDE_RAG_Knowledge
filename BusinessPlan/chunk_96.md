**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you've provided a few sources related to the transportation industry in the UK. Here's a summary of what I found:

- The UK Department for Transport released statistics on taxi and private hire vehicle licensing numbers for England in 2022, showing an increase of 5,000 licensed taxis compared to the previous year (2021).
 
- Uber Technologies, Inc. reported its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, stating that there were approximately 58,000 licensed taxis on the road at some point during the year.

It seems both sources confirm an increase in licensed taxi numbers compared to the same period in previous years.
