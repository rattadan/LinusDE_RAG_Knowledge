## 📝 AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different users on various dates and times.

First, I need to parse through each message and identify the important elements. The main topics seem to be:

1. **Greek Oil**: The first message asks what Greek oil is. There's a later mention in a joke about a "Greek oil" salad, but it's probably unrelated to actual oil. Maybe not a key point unless there's more context.

2. **Astonic Community Announcement**: SparcoGx mentions ATC/USDC coming to Osmosis on May 20, 2025. This is a specific event with a date and time, so that's a key point.

3. **Airdrop Issues**: There's a discussion about airdrop warnings from MetaMask. Kopi_Ludak and Tzouzepe13 mention submitting a PR to MetaMask to remove the warning because their apps don't interface with MetaMask. CR20202025 asks about a warning, and AirdropGlideapp explains it's a MetaMask issue. Also, MissRose_bot mentions a community airdrop tracker and a banned user.

4. **Banned Users**: MissRose_bot bans two users, Mariana Bernado and Kamesh, with reasons given as "bye" and "👋". Not sure if the reasons are significant, but the bans are noted.

5. **Market Data**: CoinhallBot provides price data for ATOM, ATONE/OSMO, and jackal/SOL. The user might want the price and changes highlighted.

6. **Other Mentions**: There's a YouTube link, a joke about a "Walmart salad", and some casual greetings. These might not be key points unless they relate to decisions.

Decisions to highlight: 
- The Astonic team launching ATC/USDC on Osmosis.
- The action taken by Kopi_Ludak and others to submit a PR to MetaMask.
- The banning of users by MissRose_bot.

Need to structure the summary to include these points concisely. Avoid the jokes and casual greetings unless necessary. Check for any other important announcements or actions. The market data is straightforward but should be mentioned with key stats like price, 24h, 7d changes

## 🔍 Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key topics are.

Starting with the first message from BasementNodes asking "What is Greek oil?" That seems like a direct question about Greek oil, so that's one topic. Then there's an iconoicono message with a YouTube link and a comment about "COOM pub" and not understanding them because they coomed too much. COOM might be an acronym or slang, but the mention of a pub and confusion could relate to a community event or maybe an inside joke. Maybe "COOM pub" is a topic here.

Next, SparcoGx announces ATC/USDC coming to Osmosis. ATC is likely a token symbol, so "ATC/USDC listing on Osmosis" would be relevant. The date and time are specific, but the main topic is the listing. They also mention a tweet to blow up, so maybe "Astonic community promotion" as well.

Tzouzepe13 says "I am fine bro" which is a personal check-in. Another message from Kartoffelfren in Greek translates to something about a Greek Smurf getting lost in a mushroom. The user might be referring to a meme or a cultural reference, so "Greek Smurf meme" could be a topic.

SithLordx shares a link about Akash, so "Akash Network" is a topic. Tzouzepe13 again mentions not feeling well and a username insult, which might be personal drama but not a main topic. Lostreply asks Tzouzepe13 if they're okay, which is part of the same conversation thread.

Tzouzepe13 mentions Greek oil again and talks about eating burgers and a Greek salad. Since Greek oil was already mentioned, maybe that's a recurring topic. The McDonald's comment might be a joke, so "Cosmonaut joke" or something similar.

MissRose_bot posts links to airdrop trackers and dashboards. AirdropGlideapp and Leap wallet are mentioned, so "Community airdrop tracker" and "Leap airdrop dashboard" are topics. There's a discussion about a MetaMask warning and submitting a PR to remove it, so "MetaMask phishing warning" and "AirdropG

## 😊 Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The user provided a list of chat messages with timestamps and usernames. 

Starting with the first message: "BasementNodes at 2025-05-19T23:58:37+00:00: What is Greek oil?" That seems like a straightforward question. The user is asking for information, not expressing any emotion. So, neutral.

Next, "iconoicono at 2025-05-19T22:07:21+00:00: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpPk36wJ280" Then they say, "the COOM pub. they coomed so much that no one can understand them." The term "coomed" might be slang or a typo. If "coom" is a project name, then "they coomed so much" could be negative, implying something went wrong. Maybe negative?

Then SparcoGx's message: "**🚀 Big News, Astonic Community!** ATC/USDC is coming to Osmosis! ⚛️ ... Get ready to trade ATC on the biggest DEX..." The use of emojis and exclamation points suggests excitement. Positive.

Tzouzepe13 says, "I am fine bro." Neutral, just a response about their state.

Kartoffelfren writes in Greek: "είναι ένα Έλληνα Στρουμφ που χάνεται στο μανιτάρι του για να κλανήσει." Translating that, "Stroumf" is "Smurf" in English. Maybe a playful jab? If it's a nickname or inside joke, could be neutral or slightly negative depending on context. But since it's in another language and might be a meme, maybe neutral.

SithLordx shares a link and says "Nice for akash." Positive, as "nice" is a compliment.

Tzouzepe13 again: "Όχι φίλε δεν νοιωθω καλά είναι τ

## ✅ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify what's relevant.

Starting with the earliest messages, there's a lot of Greek text and casual banter. The first message from BasementNodes asks "What is Greek oil?" which seems like a question but not an action item. Then there's a link from iconoicono, but it's just a YouTube video and a comment about COOM pub, which might be slang or a joke, not an action item.

Next, SparcoGx announces that ATC/USDC is coming to Osmosis on May 20, 2025, at 12:00 UTC. That's a clear next step for the community to prepare for the trading date. They also mention a link to blow up a tweet, so maybe that's an action item to engage on social media.

Looking at Tzouzepe13's messages, there's a conversation about airdrops. He asks if those who didn't claim will have another chance. Then there's a discussion with Kopi_Ludak and AirdropGlideapp about a MetaMask warning. Kopi_Ludak mentions submitting a PR to MetaMask to remove the warning, and AirdropGlideapp clarifies it's a MetaMask issue. So the action item here is the PR submission to MetaMask, which is already done. They also note that the warning doesn't affect Cosmos apps, so maybe a decision to inform users about that.

MissRose_bot provides links to airdrop trackers and dashboards. Those are resources but not action items unless someone needs to check them. CR202020 mentions a warning about an airdrop's legitimacy, leading to Kopi_Ludak's response about the PR. So the main action here is the PR submission.

Other messages like dhonironald saying "Airdrop is dead" or Ibreaktwo asking about when they'll get rich from ATOM don't seem like action items. The time-based messages from MissRose_bot like "watch tomorrow" might be a reminder but not a concrete next step.

Also, Rattadan shares a link to a simulation site, which could be a next step for users to check it out, but it's not explicitly an
