Sit in the backseat: While it can be tempting to sit in the front, especially if you get motion sickness, your chances of assault lessen if you stay in the backseat. Track your route: Use Apple or Google Maps to track your trip as it’s taking place. Wear your seat belt: Always wear your seat belt to reduce your chances of injuries or death in the event of a crash.11
Rideshare Insurance
Rideshare companies provide insurance for their drivers known as transportation network company (TNC) insurance. However, TNC only covers the periods when there are passengers in the driver’s car. It does not cover the times when the app is on and the driver is waiting for a request or when they’ve accepted a ride and are driving to the pickup location. A rideshare driver’s personal auto insurance policy won’t cover them during these periods, either, since they’re technically working and not operating their vehicle for personal use. So how should rideshare drivers handle car insurance? Enter rideshare insurance.
