## Chunk 75

**Original Text:**

Built on blockchain technology and smart contracts, nRide enables a trustless
and secure ride-hailing experience that empowers drivers and riders to interact directly, without the need for
a third party to facilitate the transaction. The escrow mechanism, powered by the NRIDE token, is a key component of the platform, ensuring that
both parties are held accountable for their commitments and providing compensation for any negative impact on the other party. The driver registry is another important component of the nRide protocol, providing
a shared database of driversâ€™ information that can be used by all nRide-compatible applications to discover
available drivers in their vicinity. The open-source nRide protocol allows anyone to build on top of it and contribute to the growth of the ecosystem, fostering innovation and collaboration. With a strong vision for the future and a dedicated team,
nRide is poised to revolutionize the ride-hailing industry by creating a more equitable and efficient

-12transportation network for everyone.
