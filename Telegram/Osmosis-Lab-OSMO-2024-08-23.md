## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions.

Starting from the top, there's a conversation about a user trying to withdraw from Osmosis to Jackal with high fees. GPKwee and Svansy mention it's a UI bug, gas isn't that high, and suggest using Keplr's IBC send or other tools like TFM or IBC fun. They also check the transaction on Mintscan. Then there's a discussion about a stuck FTM withdrawal taking 5 hours, and someone says a relayer might fix it or it could be refunded.

Next, some users talk about mobile wallets being laggy, especially Keplr and Leap on mobile. Suggestions to use PC for better experience. The_liquidator115 is asking about an Osmosis app for Android, but others say there isn't one and recommend connecting via Keplr browser.

Then there's a part about canceling a limit order on Osmosis that's not working. Griffin_web3 says the team is working on a fix for limit order issues. ChelseaLC asks about the safety of Osmosis lending, and griffin_web3 mentions risks involved.

Other messages include a user removed from an airdrop group, and some casual chats about fashion trends and marketing campaigns. The inflation cut voting is mentioned to be coming soon, maybe next Wednesday.

So the main points are: UI bug with high fees, using Keplr for transfers, stuck withdrawal and refund process, mobile wallet issues, lack of Osmosis app, limit order problems, safety concerns, and upcoming governance votes. Need to make sure the summary captures these without the casual fluff. Also, note the decisions or solutions provided, like using specific tools, refreshing, checking tx on Mintscan, and team fixes.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **High Withdrawal Fees Issue:** A user reported abnormally high fees ($300) when transferring from Osmosis to Jackal. Others clarified it‚Äôs a UI bug (gas costs are lower) and advised using Keplr‚Äôs IBC send, TFM, or IBC.fun for smoother transfers.  
2. **Stuck IBC Transfer:** A user‚Äôs FTM withdrawal via Axelar was delayed (~5 hours). The team confirmed relayers may resolve it

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or topics.

Starting from the top, there's a conversation about someone trying to withdraw funds from Osmosis to Jackal, but the fees are showing up as $300. Svansy and GPKwee mention it's a bug with the gas fees being overestimated. So "gas fees bug" and "IBC transfer issues" might be topics here.

Then there's a mention of a user being removed from the Cosmos Ecosystem AirDrop group for talking about a coin. That seems like a separate topic related to "airdrop group removal" or "community moderation issues."

Looking further down, poletentile has a stuck FTM withdrawal, and griffin_web3 is helping them check the transaction on Mintscan. This relates to "stuck transactions" and "IBC transfer delays." There's also a mention of relayers and refunds, so "relayer issues" and "transaction refunds" could be part of that.

Another thread is about using Keplr on mobile vs. PC. Svansy and others discuss that Keplr is buggy on mobile, suggesting using Leap Wallet or a PC. So topics here would be "mobile wallet issues" and "Keplr wallet performance."

The_liquidator115 is asking about an Osmosis app for Android, which leads to discussing the lack of a dedicated app and using Keplr's browser instead. That's "Osmosis app absence" and maybe "interchain dapp navigation."

There's a part where OsmMomo asks about canceling a limit order, and griffin_web3 mentions issues with limit orders not filling or canceling properly. That's "limit order problems" and "transaction management on Osmosis."

ChelseaLC is new and asks about the safety of Osmosis lending, with griffin_web3 warning about risks. So "Osmosis lending safety" and "DeFi risks."

User_6658531403 has a limit order that's open but not filled, and can't cancel it. This again points to "limit order issues" and possibly "user support problems."

Other messages mention inflation cuts going into voting, marketing campaigns, and general support links. These could be "inflation cut

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people over a time span. I need to go through each message and determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first few messages: GPKwee says "my pleasure" which is positive. Then jauziv1 mentions not wanting to risk users' funds, which sounds cautious, maybe neutral or slightly negative. GPKwee suggests checking with Keplr, which is a helpful action, so neutral. jauziv1 responds with "Ok that works" which is positive. The next message from jauziv1 is a question about an issue, indicating a problem, so maybe negative. GPKwee mentions it's a bug but the gas isn't that big, so clarifying a problem but not overly negative. Svansy says it's a UI issue and suggests using the wallet instead, which is a mix of negative (pointing out a problem) but providing a solution, so maybe neutral. 

Then there's a user asking about a stuck withdrawal, which is a negative sentiment. Griffin_web3 reassures them it's being handled, which is positive. Other messages about mobile wallets being laggy or not user-friendly are negative. However, some users express appreciation for the platform, like "Love the dex and the token" which is positive. There's also a mention of the team working on fixes, which is positive as it shows proactive support. 

Looking at the overall conversation, there are several complaints about technical issues (bugs, UI problems, stuck transactions) which lean negative. But there are also positive aspects where team members respond to issues, offer solutions, and users appreciate the support. Neutral parts include factual statements or questions without clear positive/negative tone. 

The challenge here is balancing the negative feedback about the platform's issues with the positive responses from the team. However, since the user is asking for the sentiment of the entire text, I need to aggregate all the messages. The majority of the messages either point out problems or discuss issues, but there are also multiple positive interactions. However, the negative aspects seem more frequent and detailed. But wait, some messages are just neutral information. 

Wait, let me recount. The negative messages: jauziv1's concern about fees, poletentile's stuck withdrawal, Svansy's criticism of mobile wallets, user_6

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see if there's anything actionable.

Starting from the top: GPKwee says "my pleasure" and jauziv1 mentions not wanting to risk users' funds. Those don't seem like actions. Then GPKwee suggests checking when Keplr pops up, jauziv1 says "Ok that works" which might indicate agreement but not a clear action item. The question about UI issues and proceeding with transfer is there, but the response is a suggestion to use Keplr IBC send, TFM, or IBC fun. That's a possible action item: suggest using specific tools for the transfer.

Svansy mentions it's a bug with gas fees and advises checking the transaction, so maybe "Verify the transaction gas fees via Keplr pop-up" as an action. Also, using IBC over the wallet instead of another method. Then jauziv1 has a user with high fees, so the next step might be to check the transaction details.

Looking at the middle part, BasementNodes mentions an Axelar upgrade causing issues with relayers not updating nodes. So "Investigate Axelar node updates" could be an action. For poletentile's stuck FTM withdrawal, griffin_web3 says to check the transaction status and wait, but also mentions a possible refund. So "Monitor stuck FTM withdrawal and check for refund" might be a next step.

Then there's a discussion about using mobile wallets being laggy. The_liquidator115 is advised to try Keplr or Leap Wallet on PC. So "Recommend using Keplr or Leap Wallet on PC for smoother experience" is an action.

For OsmMomo's question about canceling a limit order, griffin_web3 says there's an issue and the team is working on it. So "Address limit order cancellation issue" is a decision or next step.

ChelseaLC asks about the safety of Osmosis lending, and griffin_web3 mentions DYOR and risks. Not an action item. Later, user_6658531403 has a problem with a limit order not filling or canceling. The team is looking into it, so "Investigate and fix limit order issues" would be an action
