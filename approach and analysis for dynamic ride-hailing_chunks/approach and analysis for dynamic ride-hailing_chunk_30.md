I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

The
most used strategies are the nearest strategy and different variants of
matching-based approaches. In the nearest strategy, an incoming request is processed immediately. All of the available vehicles are checked for their distance or
travel time to the pickup location, and the nearest/fastest vehicle is
selected, provided that it can reach the pickup location in time. While
this is a very greedy strategy that can be suboptimal in various settings,
it provides the customer with an immediate response. Thus, when
customers demand a response immediately after requesting service
(ùëáùëÅ = 0), this strategy is usually chosen. Following this argumentation,
it would make sense to also reject the customer immediately in case
there is no feasible assignment possible. By that, we lose the option to
find a feasible assignment at a later point.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

1. The most used strategies mentioned in the context of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems are:
	* Nearest strategy
	* Different variants of matching-based approaches (not explicitly listed, but implied as alternative strategies)
2. The nearest strategy involves checking all available vehicles for their distance or travel time to the pickup location and selecting the closest/fastest one that can reach the pickup location in time.
3. While the immediate response is considered desirable by customers with high demand (ùëáùëÅ = 0), it may not always be feasible due to various constraints, such as:
	* No available vehicles
	* Unfeasible vehicle locations
	* Time constraints

**Context Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

1. The text is connected to the surrounding context by discussing dynamic dispatch strategies in ride-hailing systems.
2. The discussion of nearest strategy and matching-based approaches builds upon the understanding that customers demand an immediate response, which is a primary concern for companies like Uber or Lyft.
3. The consideration of constraints such as vehicle availability, location, time constraints, and feasibility assignments implies that the text is also addressing real-world complexities in dynamic dispatch.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. Customers with high demand (ùëáùëÅ = 0) are prioritized in the nearest strategy.
2. The system should be able to handle situations where there is no available vehicle or an unfeasible assignment can be made.
3. Real-time response for customers with demand immediately after requesting service is a key consideration, implying that the system should be able to process requests promptly without hesitation.

Overall, this text chunk provides insight into the most common strategies used in dynamic dispatch and repositioning of vehicles in ride-hailing systems, while also highlighting the importance of considering various constraints and requirements for effective implementation.
