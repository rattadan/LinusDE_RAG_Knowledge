**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

The exact formula is:

Average APR=(∑i∈current round bidstribute valueitotal current round locked atomi)×12\text{Average APR} = \left(\frac{\sum_{\substack{i \in \text{current round bids}}} \text{tribute value}_i}{\text{total current round locked atom}_i}\right) \times 12Average APR=(total current round locked atomi​∑i∈current round bids​​tribute valuei​​)×12

Note that this average APR may change drastically throughout a round:

It will increase if bidders increase their tribute It will decrease if more voters lock and vote for bids

It also may not match your user-specific APR, which is based on the bid bid you’ve selected, specifically, the tribute attached to the bid and your share of the voting power supporting the bid. The user-specific APR number is not currently displayed in the Hydro interface but will likely be added later. Keep in mind that the Average APR is very dynamic. It is a snapshot at a particular point in time.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

1.  The exact formula for calculating the Average APR is provided as:

    Average APR = (∑i∈current round bids tribute valueitotal current round locked atomi) × 12

    This formula calculates the average APR by dividing the total tribute value of all bids in the current round by the total amount of locked ATOM in the current round, and then multiplying by 12 to convert to an annualized rate.
2.  The average APR may change over time due to the following factors:
    *   Bidders increasing their tribute value will increase the average APR.
    *   Voters locking and voting for bids will decrease the average APR.
3.  The user-specific APR is calculated based on the tribute attached to the bid they've selected and their share of voting power supporting that bid. This calculation is not currently displayed in the Hydro interface but is planned to be added later.
4.  The user-specific APR is distinct from the average APR and will reflect the specific APR associated with the bid selected by the user.

**Contextual Connection:**

This text chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing a mathematically precise formula for calculating the Average APR in the Hydro system. It connects to the previously discussed topics of voting power, tribute distributions, and APRs, serving as a detailed explanation of the APR calculation mechanism.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

*   The calculation of the Average APR requires data on the total tribute value of all bids in the current round and the total locked ATOM in the current round.
*   The user-specific APR calculation is dependent on the tribute attached to the specific bid selected by the user and their share of voting power supporting that bid.
*   The average APR is dynamic and may change over time as the situation evolves.
*   The user-specific APR will be displayed in the Hydro interface in the future, but it is not currently available.
