# User Analysis: womenfromcosmos

## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided two tweets from an account, and they want a summary with five points and keywords.

First, I need to identify the main topics. The first tweet mentions being included in a monthly NFT airdrop by WFC, and the author says they won't sell their Daphne NFT. The second tweet talks about art being utility, with a link and an image. So the main themes are NFTs, airdrops, and art's utility.

Next, the language style. The author uses emojis like üòç and ü•∞, which are common in social media, showing a friendly and enthusiastic tone. The use of hashtags like #NFTs indicates they're active in the NFT community.

Legitness evaluation: The user is involved with WFC (Women from Cosmos), a known NFT project. They're promoting an airdrop and not selling their NFT, which is a common practice in the NFT space. So the account is legitimate in the context of NFTs.

The ecosystem is WFC, which is a blockchain-based NFT project. The author is likely a member or promoter of this project.

For the author's character: They seem enthusiastic, maybe a bit overconfident with the "I will not sell" statement. Their motivation is likely to promote WFC and their NFTs. Emotional patterns show excitement and gratitude. Decision-making is based on community and project alignment.

Putting it into context, the author is actively participating in WFC's airdrops and promoting their NFTs, which aligns with their values of supporting and promoting the project.

Keywords: NFTs, airdrop, WFC, art utility, Daphne NFT. These tags help in categorizing the tweets for further processing.
