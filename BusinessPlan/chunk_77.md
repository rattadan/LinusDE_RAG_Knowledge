## Chunk 77

**Original Text:**

Critical vulnerabilities can be minimized by enforcing
rigorous testing practices, and by hiring outside auditors
before releasing. Any system, whether it is blockchain based
or not, is vulnerable to bugs and security issues. With more
than 10 years as a software engineer in this field, Martin has
learned how to implement state-of-the art testing/validation
practices. Other Technical Risks
Description

Mitigation

NKN outage. nRide relies on NKN, a decentralised overlay
network, to enable p2p communication between mobile
devices.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The text mentions that critical vulnerabilities can be minimized by enforcing rigorous testing practices and hiring outside auditors before releasing a system, as well as acknowledging the potential for bugs and security issues in any system.

It also lists mitigation techniques such as:

1. NKN outage - implementing measures to prevent or mitigate the impact of an NKN outage.
2. Blockchain-based systems - being aware of the potential risks associated with blockchain technology and taking steps to minimize them.

Overall, the text suggests that acknowledging vulnerabilities is a crucial step in minimizing their impact, rather than trying to ignore or downplay them.
