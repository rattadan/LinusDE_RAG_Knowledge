<think>
Okay, I need to analyze this tweet from PashovCapital. Let's start by breaking down the content.

First, the main topics. The user is talking about stopping writing checks over $10k, previously up to $20-25k. They mention that 30x better means $600k vs. $300k, but they think $300k is enough. They also mention wanting more partners and missed opportunities. So the themes here are investment strategies, financial goals, and partnership opportunities. The person is likely in the venture capital or private equity space.

Next, the language style. The tweet is concise, uses numbers and comparisons, and has a confident, assertive tone. Words like "watch me win" suggest confidence and a desire for success. The use of "missed opportunity" implies they're reflecting on past decisions and aiming to correct them.
