Suggestions for improvement:

3. **Evaluate the effectiveness of your social media advertising metrics**: While it's good that you're tracking certain metrics, such as brand awareness and ad clicks, consider collecting more data on other key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversions, customer acquisition costs, or return on investment (ROI).
4. **Provide examples of successful partnerships**: Highlighting any successful collaborations with ride-hailing companies, application developers, or gig-economy platforms can help demonstrate the value of your product lines to potential customers.
5. **Consider leveraging influencer marketing or content partnerships**: Partnering with influencers or creating sponsored content for ride-hailing apps or related businesses could help expand your reach and credibility within the industry.

Overall, your strategy seems well-planned, and by addressing these areas, you can further refine your approach and drive more effective results for your product lines.
