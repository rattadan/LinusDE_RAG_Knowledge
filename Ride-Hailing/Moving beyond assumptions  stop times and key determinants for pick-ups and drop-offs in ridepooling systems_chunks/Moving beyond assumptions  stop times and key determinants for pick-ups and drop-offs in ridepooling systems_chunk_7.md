**Original Text:**

As we look
toward the future of operations involving autonomous vehicles (AVs), the economic advantages of DRT providers are expected to increase (Bösch et al. 2018). The decision regarding
whether a public PT system should rely on a regular bus line service or on DRT is highly
dependent on local conditions within the service area (Baier, Sörensen, and Schlüter 2024). Nonetheless, DRT services like ridpeooling are likely to become a regular transportation
option (Kostorz, Fraedrich, and Kagerbauer 2021). Consequently, accurately representing
DRT services in simulation models is essential for assessing their efficiency and integration into the broader transportation landscape. Given that PUDO events primarily occur
on roadways (Harmann et al. 2023a) and the frequency of PUDO activities is expected to
increase, knowledge about stop times and influencing determinants is crucial. However,
scientific literature concerning ridepooling services has mainly focused on service optimisation (Alonso-Mora et al.
