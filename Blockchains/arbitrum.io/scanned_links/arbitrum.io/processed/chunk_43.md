### Document Overview  
The content explains the differences between persistent and session cookies, their purposes, and the distinction between first-party and third-party cookies, detailing how they are managed on Arbitrum.io services.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Persistent Cookies**: Remain in the browser until deleted, used for user recognition and session tracking.  
- **Session Cookies**: Temporary and deleted when the browser is closed or after a short time, enabling page navigation and data retention.  
- **First-Party Cookies**: Set by the website publisher (e.g., Arbitrum.io), used to recognize users and enhance experience.  
- **Third-Party Cookies**: Set by external parties (e.g., analytics tools), used for tracking user behavior.  
- **Cookie Deactivation**: Cookies are deactivated when users disconnect from the Services.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Cookie Lifecycles**: Persistent cookies are stored longer, while session cookies are deleted upon browser closure or timeout.  
- **Cookie Management**: Persistent cookies are re-read when users return, while session cookies are transient and lost upon navigation.  
- **Technical Notes**: The document emphasizes that cookies are tied to user connectivity and are not retained across sessions unless explicitly configured.
