## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
This content provides an overview of Ethereum, its core features, developer tools, community contributions, and roadmap, emphasizing its role in Web3, smart contract development, and decentralized applications.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with terms encoded in plaintext, supported via Solidity or Vyper.  
- **Web3**: Decentralized ecosystem enabling decentralized apps (DApps), tokens, and blockchain-based services.  
- **JavaScript/Python**: Language ecosystems for building DApps, wallets, and tools.  
- **Permissionless DNS**: Open, decentralized domain system for routing traffic to applications.  
- **Open Source**: Community-driven maintenance of the Ethereum.org website.  
- **Ethereum Foundation**: Governance and roadmap development.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Development Tools**: JavaScript/Python for building wallets, tokens, and DApps.  
- **Smart Contract Languages**: Solidity (C++) and Vyper (Python) for writing code.  
- **Open Source Contribution**: Users can edit content or propose changes to the website.  
- **Roadmap**: Updated monthly via blog posts and community events.  
- **Event Calendar**: Scheduled events (e.g., May 14, 2025) for developers and the community.  

### Related Topics  
- **Ethereum Foundation Blog**: Resources for developers and researchers.  
- **Solidity Lang Blog**: Technical insights into the Solidity language.  
- **Community Events**: Global conferences and workshops (e.g., Amsterdam, May 2025).  
- **Open Source Contributions**: Guidelines for contributing to the Ethereum.org website.
