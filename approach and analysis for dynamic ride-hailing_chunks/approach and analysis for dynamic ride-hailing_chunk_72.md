I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

Only the results for 𝛿𝑀 ∈ {15 s, 60 s} are shown, representing
short and long matching intervals. Values in between were tested as
well, but did not lead to better results than both presented values. The proportion of served requests (service rate 𝑆𝑅) as well as the
average waiting time (𝑊 𝑇 ) are reported for all three strategies. We
distinguish between the two specifications all vehicles and non-serving
vehicles, which indicate the vehicles available to receive a new request. The primary optimization goal considered is a maximum service rate;
the secondary goal is a minimum waiting time. According to this

**Technical Details and Parameters**

The specific technical details mentioned in this chunk are:

1. `𝛿𝑀 ∈ {15 s, 60 s}`: This represents two different matching intervals (short and long) for the results to be shown.
2. `service rate 𝑆𝑅`: This refers to the proportion of served requests, which is a measure of how effective the system is in meeting customer demands.
3. `average waiting time (𝑊 𝑇 )`: This represents the average time spent waiting for customers before receiving a request.
4. `𝐷𝑆𝑅 = 70` and `𝐷𝑆𝑅 = 100`: These represent two different maximum waiting times, which are used to test the system.

**Contextual Connection**

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing a summary of previous research on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.
2. Introducing new topics related to demand forecasting, rebalancing strategies, and simulation platforms.
3. Mentioning specific methodologies and results from studies on shortening matching intervals and increasing maximum waiting times.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints**

The requirements mentioned are:

1. The proportion of served requests (service rate 𝑆𝑅) as well as the average waiting time (𝑊 𝑇 ) should be reported for all three strategies.
2. The primary optimization goal is a maximum service rate; the secondary goal is a minimum waiting time.

These requirements are essential to evaluating the effectiveness of different dynamic dispatch strategies in real-time management systems.
