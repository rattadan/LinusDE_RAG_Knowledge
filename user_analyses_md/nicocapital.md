   - The tweets appear to be legitimate in the sense that they are genuine expressions
   - There's no obvious spam or bot behavior
   - The account seems focused on financial commentary and results reporting
   - The legitimacy of the information shared (particularly the financial figures) cannot be verified from this content alone

Putting these tweets into bigger context of intentions:
The author appears to be sharing financial information while also offering commentary on financial behavior and systems. The tweet about Confuturo's financial results suggests they want to keep their audience informed about specific companies' performance. The tweet about ELD seems to comment on investor behavior and knowledge gaps in the market. The more philosophical tweets about complexity and pension systems indicate the author wants to provoke thought about financial systems and decision-making. Overall, these tweets suggest an intention to position the author as a financial commentator who provides both factual information and conceptual insights about finance.
