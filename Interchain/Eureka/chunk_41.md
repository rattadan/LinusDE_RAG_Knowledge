## Chunk 41

**Original Text:**

We strongly agree with this conclusion. Unlike CW20s , tokenfactory tokens have no limitations in the cross-chain functionality Skip Go API can offer for them. ​
What limitations do CW20 tokens have within the Skip Go API? At a high-level, basically any multi-chain action—in which the token is on the chain where it was issued for one stage of the action—requires multiple transactions. In particular, this means you cannot perform the following actions in 1 transaction:

IBC transfer after purchasing a cw20 asset
Chain 1 is the origin chain where the cw20 token can be swapped freely, but it cannot be transferred to another chain in the same transaction.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

According to the text, CW20 tokens within the Skip Go API have several limitations compared to tokenfactory tokens like CW20s. Specifically:

* They require multiple transactions for certain multi-chain actions.
* For instance:
	+ Performing an IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) transfer after purchasing a CW20 asset is not allowed in a single transaction.

This implies that CW20 tokens, unlike tokenfactory tokens, have constraints on how they can be used across different blockchain chains within the Skip Go API.
