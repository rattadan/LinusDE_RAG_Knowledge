I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

Please note that for big instances, a slightly modified
version of this formula has to be used because ùëò! can grow beyond
the limits of typical datatypes. The modified formula as well as its
derivation can be found in Appendix A. This undersupply probability
idea makes it possible to explicitly balance higher repositioning costs
and increased rewards due to a higher service rate. In settings where,
instead of the number of served requests, the overall profit of the
system is the main objective (e.g., Kullman et al., 2021), it should be
calculated whether repositioning orders are worth the additional travel
costs. For that, we can estimate the expected reward per request in the
lot zone under consideration based on historical data. Since the reward
depends on the distance traveled, average requests in the city center
might have different expected rewards than requests in outer areas. Multiplying the expected reward with the undersupply probability
leads to an expected missed reward.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text is explaining a technical detail related to dynamic dispatch and repositioning in ride-hailing systems, specifically addressing the issue of balancing costs and rewards in these scenarios.

**1. Technical details:**
The section mentions that for large-scale instances of dynamic dispatch, using a modified formula is necessary because \(k!\) (factorial of k) can exceed typical datatypes limits. This implies that the problem involves complex calculations involving permutations or combinations, likely due to the need to handle multiple requests and repositioning scenarios.

**2. Context:**
This chunk connects to the broader context by referencing specific references on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems. It also builds upon the surrounding text by introducing a mathematical concept (modifying the formula) that is essential for understanding the solution.

**3. Requirements and conditions:**
The section requires understanding of:
- Dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies
- Ride-hailing system management, including demand forecasting and profit optimization
- Mathematical modeling techniques, such as simulation platforms and deep learning approaches

To meet the requirements, the reader must have a basic understanding of these concepts, particularly in the context of ride-hailing systems. The section assumes familiarity with:

- Simulation models (e.g., Bischoff & Maciejewski, 2016; Geng et al., 2019)
- Deep learning approaches (e.g., Braverman et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2021)
- Dynamic programming and optimization techniques
- Mathematical modeling in the context of ride-hailing systems
