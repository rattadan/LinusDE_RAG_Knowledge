Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the given tweets and provide a summary with specific elements. First, I need to understand the main topics. The tweets mention the Biconomy team, blockchain dev experiences, supertransactions, and perp trading. So the main themes are blockchain, supertransactions, and perp trading.

Next, the language style and tone. The tweets are casual, using phrases like "Nomy team is cooking something special" and "be me, blockchain dev." The tone is friendly, engaging, and sometimes a bit humorous, with emojis and informal language.

Key characteristics of communication: The user is likely a blockchain developer sharing their experience. They use slang, list out problems, and offer solutions. The communication is direct, relatable, and uses humor to engage the audience.
