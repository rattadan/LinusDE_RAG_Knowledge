## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages, mostly from Telegram.

First, I need to parse through the messages and identify the main topics. The earliest message is from Syed1111 about AADAO sunsetting the DAO, with a link. Then there's a lot of discussion about adding $BZE into Sputnik Navigation bot, with some issues because the developer is blind and there was a mistake in the buttons. People are mentioning how to use the bot, filtering pairs, and promoting the BZE-OSMO pool with APR. Forthex and Serranoooooo are asking for a Planq Network group. There's also a mention of verifying a real person for an admin role.

Key points would be: AADAO sunsetting, Sputnik bot adding BZE, the developer's accessibility issue causing delays, promotion of the BZE-OSMO pool, requests for a Planq group, and admin verification. Need to structure these clearly without the timestamps and extra details. Make sure to highlight the decisions made, like adding BZE, fixing the buttons, and the DAO shutdown.
</think>

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **AADAO Sunsets:** Syed1111 announced the AADAO contributors' decision to disband the DAO, with details linked on X (Twitter).  
2. **SputnikPriceBot Update:** $BZE token was added to the Sputnik Navigation bot for quick price checks, though a temporary issue with missing buttons was attributed to a blind developer's error, promising a fix "ASAP."  
3. **BZE-OSMO Pool Promotion:** faneatiku encouraged adding liquidity to the $BZE/$OSMO pool on Osmosis (link provided), highlighting competitive APR rewards.  
4. **Community Requests:** Forthex (Planq Network community manager) and Serranoooooo requested the creation of a Planq Network Telegram group.  
5. **Admin Verification:** A user needed to confirm their real-person status to obtain an admin role.  
6. **Other Mentions:** Links to Cosmos Ecosystem updates, Warden Protocol, and general community interactions (e.g., gratitude, bot usage instructions).  

**Decisions/Actions:**  
- Fix $BZE button integration in SputnikPriceBot.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify what they're talking about.

Starting from the top, there's a message about verifying a real person for an admin role. That seems like a security or moderation topic. Then there's a link to a Telegram message, which might be related to Cosmos Ecosystem. Another message mentions Planq Network and a user named Forthex representing it. So Planq Network is definitely a topic.

Next, there's a message about a developer being blind, which is a mention of accessibility issues. Then someone talks about filtering pairs by clicking a button, which relates to cryptocurrency trading or DeFi. Another message mentions using a bot to get prices for favorite pairs, so that's Sputnik Price Bot. There's also a mention of adding liquidity on $BZE $OSMO pool with APR, which points to BeeZee (BZE) token and Osmosis pool. 

Other parts include a link to a Twitter post about AADAO sunsetting, so that's AADAO DAO. There's a thank you message, which is general community interaction. The mention of Cosmos Ecosystem again, and a ForkDAO reference. Also, some emojis and casual conversation, but those might not be main topics.

Putting it all together: The main topics are Planq Network, Sputnik Price Bot, BeeZee (BZE) token, Osmosis pool, AADAO DAO, accessibility issues (blind developer), admin verification, and community interaction. Maybe also the Cosmos Ecosystem itself. I should check if any other links or names are significant. The user Forthex is mentioned as representing Planq Network, but the main topics are the projects and tools discussed. So the list should include those projects, tokens, and tools. I'll make sure to format them as a comma-separated list without spaces after commas.
</think>

Planq Network, Sputnik Price Bot, BeeZee (BZE), Osmosis pool, AADAO DAO, accessibility issues (blind developer), admin verification, Cosmos Ecosystem, DeFi liquidity, Telegram group request, cryptocurrency price tracking, developer collaboration, community interaction

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a bunch of chat messages and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. Hmm, first, I need to go through each message and determine its sentiment individually, then see if there's an overall trend.

Starting from the top. The first message says, "Just we need to verify that you are real person to give you admin role." That sounds neutral. It's a procedural statement, no clear positive or negative emotion. Next is a link to a Telegram message. Links themselves don't carry sentiment unless there's context, but since it's just a URL, I'll mark that as neutral.

Then there's a message about Planq Network and "@Forthex - represents Planq Network." Again, informative, so neutral. The next line is "Let's do it!" which is definitely positive. It's enthusiastic and shows eagerness. 

"Always glad to help))" ‚Äì the double parentheses might be a typo, but "glad" is positive. So that's positive. 

"Will be fixed soon" ‚Äì this is neutral. It's a promise or assurance, but not clearly positive or negative. 

"One of our developers - blind dev. He tell that he is 75% full-stack: 100% back-end, 50% front-end." This seems neutral as well. It's a factual statement about a developer's skills and situation. 

Moving on to faneatiku's messages. "I'll wait for your tag when it's fixed to see how it goes" ‚Äì neutral, just waiting for an update. 

"anyhow, we're very thankful for this" ‚Äì "thankful" is positive. 

"i saw BZE in the text, but not in the buttons" ‚Äì neutral, pointing out a discrepancy. 

"(i'm smiling for sure)" ‚Äì positive, indicating happiness. 

"I don't know if I can laugh at this or not üòê" ‚Äì the emoji shows uncertainty or mild frustration, but the message itself is a bit neutral with a slight negative leaning because of the confusion. Wait, but the emoji is üòê which is neutral. So maybe neutral here. 

Forthex says, "Could we get a planq group üëÄ I'm the community manager üî•" ‚Äì positive. The üî• emoji indicates enthusiasm. 

Serranoooooo: "Wen

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see if there's anything that needs to be done.

The first message is from "unknown" at 23:56:51 saying they need to verify someone is a real person to give an admin role. That seems like an action item for the person being addressed, but since the user is "unknown," maybe the admin needs to follow up with verification steps.

Then there's a message from "unknown" at 23:56:23 with a link to a Telegram message. Not sure if that's an action item unless someone needs to check the link, but maybe it's just a reference.

Another "unknown" message at 23:56:06 mentions Planq Network and @Forthex representing it. Maybe Forthex needs to take some steps related to that, but it's not clear what. The next message from Forthex at 22:52:46 asks for a Planq Network group. So maybe creating a group is a next step. Similarly, Serranoooooo at 22:01:18 also asks about the group, so that's another indication that forming a group is needed.

Syed1111 at 18:48:00 informs about AADAO sunsetting. That's a decision made, so the next step might be to inform others or handle the DAO's closure. 

An "unknown" message at 17:55:19 says BZE wasn't added to buttons because the dev is blind and will fix ASAP. So the action item here is for the dev to add BZE to the buttons. The dev needs to fix that issue.

Faneatiku at 16:42:19 mentions couldn't find BZE, which relates to the previous message. So the fix is pending. Then at 15:39:10, faneatiku asks how to use the bot and if there's a website. The unknown responder at 15:09:22 added BZE to Sputnik Navigation, so maybe the next step is to check the bot or the website. Also, the responder mentioned filtering tokens, so users might need to do that.
