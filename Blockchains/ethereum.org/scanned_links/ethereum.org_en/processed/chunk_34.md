## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
This content explains Ethereum's transparency, block explorers, and the structure of data available for analyzing blocks, transactions, and accounts on the Ethereum network, including execution and consensus data.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Execution Data**: Transactions executed in a block (e.g., gas usage, transaction details).  
- **Consensus Data**: Block information (timestamp, proposer, validators) and network state (gas prices, network usage).  
- **Gas Usage & Prices**: Metrics for transaction costs and network congestion.  
- **Transaction Data**: Details about individual transactions (e.g., sender, receiver, value).  
- **Account Data**: Information about user accounts (balance, nonce, transactions).  
- **Smart Contract Accounts**: Additional data for accounts interacting with smart contracts (code snippets, function calls).  
- **Testnets**: Support for alternative networks (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby) with similar data structures.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Block Time**: Blocks are added every 12 seconds (unless a proposer misses their turn).  
- **Gas Prices**: Block explorers display live gas prices (e.g., via APIs like `eth_gasPrice` in JSON-RPC).  
- **Execution vs. Consensus Data**:  
  - **Execution Data** includes fields like `gasUsed`, `txHash`, and `to` (e.g., `{"gasUsed": "20000", "txHash": "0x..."}`).  
  - **Consensus Data** includes block headers (e.g., `timestamp`, `miner`, `nonce`) and validator details.  
- **APIs for Integration**: Example: Use `eth_gasPrice` API to fetch current gas prices for transaction estimation.  

### Related Topics  
- **Ethereum API Documentation**: Details about APIs like `eth_gasPrice` and `eth_getBalance` for data extraction.  
- **Testnets**: Mention of Ropsten, Rinkeby, and other testnets with similar data structures.  
- **Smart Contract Development**: Connection to Ethereum's Solidity and EVM features (e.g., code display in block explorers).

concepts of Ethereum so you can make sense of the data that a block explorer gives you. Start withan intro to Ethereum.

Ethereum is transparent by design so everything is verifiable. Block explorers provide an interface for getting this information. And this is for both the main Ethereum network and the testnets, should you need that data. Data is divided into execution data and consensus data. The execution data refers to the transactions that have been executed in a specific block. The consensus data refers to the blocks themselves and the validators who proposed them.

Here's a summary of the types of data you can get from a block explorer.

New blocks are added to Ethereum every 12 seconds (unless a block proposer misses its turn), so a near-constant stream of data gets added to block explorers. Blocks contain a lot of important data that you may find useful:

Not only will block explorers give you data about Gas usage in transactions and blocks, but some will give you information on the network's current gas prices. This will help you understand network usage, submit safe transactions and not overspend on gas. Look out for APIs that can help you get this information into your product's interface. Gas-specific data covers:

Block explorers have become a common place for people to track the progress of their transactions. That's because the level of detail you can get provides extra certainty. Transaction data includes:

There's a lot of data that you can access about an account. This is why it's often recommended to use multiple accounts so that your assets and value can't be easily tracked. There are also some solutions being developed to make transactions and account activity more private. But here's the data that's available for accounts:

Smart contract accounts have all the data that a user account will have, but some block explorers will even display some code information too. Examples include:

```
