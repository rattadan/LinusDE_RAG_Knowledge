**Original Text:**

For Manhattan distances, however, the zones form a
square standing on its corner, with the square‚Äôs diagonals
having the
‚àö
length of 2 ‚ãÖ ùëáùëä and the square‚Äôs side length being 2 ‚ãÖ ùëáùëä . Because the
overlap calculation differs completely depending on the used distance
metric, we show the formula for both cases. Appendix C. Demand estimation error generation
To test the influence of demand estimation errors, some noise
has to be added to the exact demand estimation usually used in the
repositioning approaches. This demand estimation is done by taking
the real future demand sampled by the framework at the beginning
of each planning horizon, mapping all requests to zones, and then
counting the requests per zone for all 30 min intervals of the planning
horizon. The zones correspond to the zones used in the respective
repositioning approaches. Please note that these zones differ between
the benchmark approaches and our proposed approach. Additionally,
the zones in our approach are overlapping.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the provided text chunk:

**Exact technical details, parameters, or processes described:**

* Manhattan distances and their square shape with diagonals having a length of 2 * TW (where TW is the side length)
* The overlap calculation between the squares due to different distance metrics
* The formula for both scenarios: using ‚àö length of diagonal = 2 * TW and using other methods

**Connection to or building upon the surrounding context:**

The text chunk provides a theoretical foundation for dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems by addressing the challenge of accurately estimating demand based on Manhattan distances. It is connected to the broader topic of dynamic dispatch, real-time management, and simulation models.

The following references are mentioned as contributing to this discussion:

* Bischoff & Maciejewski (2016): Simulation of autonomous taxi deployment in Berlin
* Braverman et al. (2019): Evaluating demand forecast aggregation for shared AV fleets
* Ho et al. (2018): Survey on dial-a-ride problems

These references highlight the importance of accurate demand estimation, simulation models, and real-world applications.

**Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

* Noise addition to exact demand estimation for testing influence of demand estimation errors
* Differences in zones between benchmark approaches and proposed approach (overlapping zones)
* The need for a formula that works for both scenarios (‚àö length of diagonal = 2 * TW)

These constraints underscore the importance of finding an accurate method for estimating demand based on Manhattan distances, as well as considering differences in zone layouts across various approaches.
