## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided tweets. First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the important information.

The first tweet from March 18th at 12:28 is promoting the Cosmos Weekly News with a bunch of crypto symbols. The main points here are the promotion of the weekly news, asking for RTs, and encouraging comments about IBC projects or events. The hashtags and tokens listed are ATOM, BCNA, AKT, FET, IOV, UMEE, JUNO, DNPN, LIKE, HUAHUA. The link is probably to the news content.

Next, the tweet at 9:34 thanks someone for tagging them and mentions spreading the word. Not much actionable here, just engagement.

Then at 9:31, there's a link shared. Without the content of the link, it's hard to say, but maybe it's a resource or announcement. However, since the user wants key points and decisions, this might not be crucial unless the link is significant.

The tweet at 4:42 talks about validators' voting power. They state that top-10 validators shouldn't have more than 10% voting power if the active set is at least 100 validators. This is a governance or network security point, so important for decisions.

At 4:37, they mention CerberusZone being added to Cosmostation Wallet App soon, with CRBRUS token. Also tags IBCwallet and CosmostationVD. So key point is the upcoming integration of CerberusZone into the wallet app.

The last tweet at 4:34 is about XPRT Account and PersistenceOne. They're breaking out XPRT account, which might relate to a new feature or partnership with PersistenceOne.

Putting it all together, the main points are the validator policy, the wallet app integration for CerberusZone, the XPRT account breakout, and the weekly news promotion with a call for engagement. The other tweets are either engagement thanks or just links without context. So the summary should highlight those key decisions and updates.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**

1. **Validator Voting Power Policy**: Cosmos advocates that no top-10 validator should hold more than 10% of voting power if the active validator set includes at least

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list. The text consists of several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first tweet mentions "Cosmos Weekly News" and uses the hashtag #IBCgang. It also lists several cryptocurrency symbols like $ATOM, $BCNA, etc. So possible topics here are Cosmos Weekly News, IBCgang, and the various crypto projects.

Next, the second tweet is a thank you for being tagged, so maybe engagement or community support. The third tweet is just a link, which might not contribute a topic. The fourth tweet talks about validators having no more than 10% voting power if the active set is over 100. That's related to blockchain governance and validator limits.

The fifth tweet mentions CerberusZone, CRBRUS in Cosmostation Wallet App, and other Twitter handles like IBCwallet and CosmostationVD. So topics here could be CerberusZone, CRBRUS, Cosmostation Wallet App, and the mentioned projects. The last tweet refers to XPRT Account and PersistenceOne, which are likely projects within the Cosmos ecosystem.

I need to compile all these topics, ensuring they're distinct and relevant. Also, check for any recurring terms or projects. The cryptocurrency symbols are probably project names, so each should be listed separately. The hashtag #IBCgang might be a community or initiative name. Governance topics like validator limits are important. Mentions of wallets and apps like Cosmostation Wallet App and IBCwallet should be included. Projects like PersistenceOne and XPRT Account are also key points.

Putting it all together, the main topics would be Cosmos Weekly News, IBCgang, ATOM, BCNA, AKT, FET, IOV, UME, JUNO, DNPN, LIKE, HUAHUA, blockchain governance, validator limits, voting power, CerberusZone, CRBRUS, Cosmostation Wallet App, IBCwallet, PersistenceOne, XPRT Account. Wait, I should check if $UMEE is correctly noted as $UMEE, but the user wrote $UMEE as $UME in their example. Wait, no, in the text it's $UMEE. Let me verify. The original text lists $ATOM $BCNA $AKT $FET $IO

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first one is a weekly news update with emojis like üì∞‚öõÔ∏èüî•, which seem positive. They're asking for support via retweets and engagement in the comments. The hashtags and the exclamation about showing support probably indicate enthusiasm, so that's a positive sentiment.

Next, the second tweet says, "Thanks for tagging us!üòéüòç We're love to spread the word!üó£Ô∏è" The use of heart eyes and a smiling face, along with expressions of gratitude and eagerness to spread the word, definitely feels positive. They're happy about being mentioned and want to share it.

The third tweet is just a URL shortener link. No text except the link. That's tricky. Since there's no actual text content, maybe it's neutral. Unless the link itself implies something positive, but without knowing where it leads, I should stick to the content provided. So neutral.

Fourth tweet: "We believe, that Top-10 validators mustn't have more than 10% of voting power, if active set not less than 100 validators!" This is a statement about governance. The sentiment here isn't clearly positive or negative. It's more about a policy stance. The user might be expressing a belief, but without emotional words, it's probably neutral.

Fifth tweet mentions CerberusZone being added to a wallet app soon. Words like "already in" and "very soon!" suggest positive news. Emojis like $CRBRUS might not affect sentiment, but the announcement of upcoming availability is positive. Also, tagging other accounts could be promoting collaboration, which is positive.

Last tweet: "We are breakout $XPRT Account!" with a PersistenceOne tag. "Breakout" here might mean they're gaining attention or growing. The term "breakout" often has a positive connotation, like a success story. So that's likely positive.

Now, compiling all these: most tweets are positive. The neutral ones are the link-only and the governance statement. But the majority are positive, with expressions of excitement, thanks, and upcoming features. The overall sentiment should be positive. They're promoting their ecosystem, showing appreciation, and sharing progress.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided Twitter messages. First, I need to go through each tweet and see what's being said.

Starting with the first tweet from March 18, 12:28 PM. It's Cosmos Weekly News promoting a tweet with a hashtag #IBCgang, asking people to comment which projects they want to see or what events they're excited about. The action item here is for users to engage by retweeting and commenting. So the main action is encouraging followers to participate.

Next, the second tweet at 9:34 AM. They thank someone for tagging them and say they love spreading the word. This seems more like a positive response and acknowledgment, but there's no specific action item here. Maybe just a decision to engage with tagged content, but not a clear next step.

Third tweet at 9:31 AM is just a link. No text, so probably not much to extract here. Maybe the next step is to check the link, but since the user is asking for action items from the text, maybe nothing here.

Fourth tweet at 4:42 AM mentions that Top-10 validators shouldn't have more than 10% voting power if the active set is at least 100 validators. This looks like a decision or a stance they're taking regarding validator distribution. So that's a decision to enforce or advocate for that voting power limit.

Fifth tweet at 4:37 AM. They mention $CRBRUS in Cosmostation Wallet App coming soon, and tag IBCwallet and CosmostationVD. The action item here is the upcoming addition of CRBRUS to the wallet app. Also, they might be collaborating with those wallets, so maybe a next step is to work with those services.

Sixth tweet at 4:34 AM: They mention breaking out $XPRT Account and tag PersistenceOne. So the next step here is promoting or launching the XPRT account, possibly in collaboration with PersistenceOne.

Now, compiling all these. The main action items are the user engagement requests (RT, comment), the decision on validator voting power, the addition of CRBRUS to Cosmostation, and the XPRT account launch. The other tweets are either acknowledgments or just links without clear actions. Need to present these in a structured way, maybe bullet
