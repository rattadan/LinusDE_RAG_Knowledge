## CosmosNetwork - Chunk 62

**Document Summary:**

This overview provides an excellent foundation for understanding Tendermint Core's architecture and its Application Binary Interface (ABCI). Let's break down the key components and their functionalities:

### 1. **Tendermint Core**
   - **Role**: Responsible for consensus, validation, and block propagation.
   - **Components**:
     - **Block Proposal**: Proposes new blocks based on transaction data.
     - **Commit Vote**: Collects votes from validators to finalize a block.
     - **Consensus Logic**: Implements BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) logic.

### 2. **ABCI Interface**
   - **Purpose**: Allows the application logic to interact with Tendermint Core.
   - **Primary Messages**:
     - **AppendTx**: Delivers transactions for validation and inclusion in blocks.
     - **CheckTx**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block (optional).
     - **Commit**: Computes cryptographic commitments of the current state.

### 3. **Application Logic**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Validate and process transactions.
     - Update application state based on transaction outcomes.
     - Respond to ABCI messages with appropriate responses.
     - Handle consensus-related tasks like reorg-proposals (if necessary).

### Detailed Breakdown

#### **AppendTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Delivers a transaction for validation and inclusion in the blockchain.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core receives a new transaction via the network.
  2. The transaction is passed to the application via `AppendTx`.
  3. Application validates the transaction against its state, protocol rules, and credentials.
  4. If valid, the application updates its internal state (e.g., UTXO database).
  5. Tendermint Core schedules the transaction for inclusion in a block.

#### **CheckTx Message**
- **Purpose**: Validates transactions before they are included in a block.
- **Flow**:
  1. Tendermint Core's mempool first checks each transaction with `CheckTx`.
  2. If the transaction passes, it is relayed to other peers for further validation.
  3. Validated transactions are then passed to application via `AppendTx` for state updates.

#### **Commit Message**
- **Purpose**: Computes a cryptographic commitment of the current application state.
- **Flow**:
  1. After processing all transactions in a block, Tendermint Core computes the commit state.
  2. This commit is signed by validators based on their voting power.
  3. The commit is then included in the next block header.

### Additional Features

#### **Validator Set Management**
- **Messages**: `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock`.
- **Purpose**:
  - `BeginBlock`: Passed to application at the start of each block, allowing it to update its state.
  - `EndBlock`: Passed after transactions have been processed, enabling finalization actions like reorg-proposal signing.

#### **Lightweight Client Support**
- **Commit Hashes**: Signed by validators, providing cryptographic proof of committed states.
- **Merkle Proofs**: Simplify verification for lightweight clients using block hashes and signed commit votes.

### Handling Byzantine Faults

1. **Forks**:
   - ≥ ⅓ Byzantine voting power can cause forks.
   - Detectable through inconsistencies in the state root, triggering social consensus mechanisms to heal the network.

2. **Censorship Attacks**:
   - > ⅔ Byzantine voting power can commit arbitrary invalid states.
   - Social consensus and legal measures are necessary for handling such failures.

3. **Reorg-Proposal Coordination**:
   - Signed by +½ of original validators, ensuring that external coordination is robust to network partitions.

### Conclusion
ABCI provides a flexible interface for integrating application logic with Tendermint Core’s consensus mechanism. By carefully validating transactions and updating state, applications can ensure consistency and reliability in blockchain operations. The ability to handle Byzantine faults through social consensus mechanisms further strengthens the overall system's resilience.

**Original Text:**

Stellar
Building on an approach pioneered by Ripple, Stellar [13] refined a model of Federated Byzantine Agreement wherein the processes participating in consensus do not constitute a fixed and globally known set. Rather, each process node curates one or more "quorum slices", each constituting a set of trusted processes. A "quorum" in Stellar is defined to be a set of nodes that contain at least one quorum slice for each node in the set, such that agreement can be reached. The security of the Stellar mechanism relies on the assumption that the intersection of any two quorums is non-empty, while the availability of a node requires at least one of its quorum slices to consist entirely of correct nodes, creating a trade-off between using large or small quorum-slices that may be difficult to balance without imposing significant assumptions about trust.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides an excellent foundation for understanding Tendermint Core's architecture and Application Binary Interface (ABCI). Here's a focused analysis:

1. **Technical Details:**
   - The chunk describes the technical process of building consensus in the context of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanisms.
   - It outlines the role of each component, including Block Proposal, Commit Vote, and Consensus Logic.
   - The text also mentions the use of quorum slices to ensure agreement among processes participating in consensus.

2. **Context Connection:**
   - This chunk connects with the surrounding context by providing insight into Tendermint Core's architecture and its Application Binary Interface (ABCI).
   - It also builds upon the previous context by introducing the concept of Byzantine Fault Tolerance, which is a critical component of Tendermint Core's consensus mechanism.

3. **Requirements and Conditions:**
   - The chunk does not explicitly mention any specific requirements or conditions that must be met for Tendermint Core to function correctly.
   - However, it implies that proper handling of Byzantine faults, such as forks and censorship attacks, is crucial for ensuring the system's reliability and resilience.

In terms of analysis, this chunk could help improve the understanding of Tendermint Core's consensus mechanism by providing a detailed explanation of its technical components and processes. It could also provide valuable insights into how to handle Byzantine faults in a distributed system like Tendermint Core.
