The user is frustrated with this limitation and is suggesting that developers should urgently implement this feature.

- The tone is frustrated and exasperated, with the user expressing disappointment about not being able to navigate between platforms
- The user uses double parentheses "(((" to express sadness or disappointment, which is common in Russian internet communication
