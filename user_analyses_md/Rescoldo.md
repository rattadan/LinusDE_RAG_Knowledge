- Government appointments and potential cronyism
- Working conditions for young professionals
- Economic difficulties affecting businesses

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
It's difficult to evaluate the legitimacy of the account itself since it's just retweeting content. The content being retweeted appears to be legitimate tweets from other accounts, but we can't evaluate their truthfulness without seeing the full context.
