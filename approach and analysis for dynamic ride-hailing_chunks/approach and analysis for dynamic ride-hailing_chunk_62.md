I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

However,
since the problem and our approach are time-based and not distancebased, the results should be generalizable to other distance metrics like
Euclidean distances, as long as the corresponding formula for handling
zone overlap (see Section 5.2 and Appendix B) is used. Requests are
generated based on the real-world New York taxi cab dataset. For that,
Manhattan is divided into 61 smaller neighborhoods, and for each 15minute time interval, the number of trips per origin–destination zone
pair from the real-world dataset is counted. This data is subsequently
used to generate new request arrival times (in the respective 15-minute
interval) as well as new origin and destination locations (in the respective zone), as in Kullman et al. (2021) and Kullman (2021). For the
driving time between origin and destination, we use the average speed
of the trips from the dataset for this origin–destination combination
in this time interval. By doing so, we achieve a very realistic dataset
for the experiments. Fig.

1. The text discusses simulation and modeling approaches, including Bischoff & Maciejewski (2016) and Braverman et al. (2019), which are mentioned as references for simulation-based methods.
2. The text also mentions dynamic dispatch and repositioning approaches from the fields of autonomous vehicles, shared mobility, and demand forecasting, such as Geng et al. (2019), Al-Kanj et al. (2020), De Souza et al. (2020), Guo et al. (2021), and Ho et al. (2018).
3. The text highlights rebalancing strategies from the field of ride-hailing systems, including empty-car routing for ridesharing.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. **Real-time management**: The text emphasizes that the results should be generalizable to other distance metrics, such as Euclidean distances.
