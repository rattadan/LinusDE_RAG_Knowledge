Buying BTC versus ETH depends on an investorâs intentions and opinions of each cryptocurrency.

Both BTC and ETH have the potential to become digital stores of value assets. However, BTCâs longer history, higher liquidity, and hard-cap supply of 21 million make it a more conservative option. Even though BTC is volatile, its value doesnât typicallyfluctuate as much as altcoinslike ETH.

On the flip side, most of todayâs cutting-edge dApps are on the Ethereum blockchain. Recent estimates suggestEthereum holds 60% of the total valuein the entire DeFi ecosystem. People interested in exploring new fields like DeFi or NFTs (non-fungible tokens) may get more value out of ETH.

The bottom line is that choosing to invest in BTC or ETC is a personal decision. Anyone considering allocating money to Bitcoin or Ethereum should review each projectâs major features to see how they align with their financial goals.Â Â
