# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_23.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.base.org/*

### Document Overview  
This content from Base.org outlines features and resources related to on-chain data management, blockchain integration, and tools for building decentralized applications (DApps) on the Base EVM ecosystem. It emphasizes the importance of publishing data on-chain, the role of Basenames, and the availability of tools like OnchainKit for integration.  

---

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Basenames**: Fully on-chain identifiers for apps/projects, requiring transactions and composability with the ecosystem.  
- **OnchainKit**: A tool for integrating Basenames into apps, enabling easy registration and management of on-chain data.  
- **EVM Chains**: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains (e.g., Base) supporting decentralized applications.  
- **Transaction-based Data**: All published information is recorded on-chain, ensuring immutability and transparency.  
- **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**: Used for identifiers (e.g., Summer Pass, Buildathon participants, base.eth holders).  
- **BNS (Blockchain Name Service)**: Allows users to own and manage names on the Base network.  
- **Gas Credits**: Tokens for paying transaction costs on EVM chains.  
- **Grants & Funding**: Programs to support project development (e.g., Base Ecosystem Fund, Rounds Grants).  

---

### Implementation Details  
- **OnchainKit**: A framework for creating and managing on-chain data (e.g., Basenames) via a tutorial.  
- **Basenames Registration**: Users can register names (e.g., `cb.id`, `basename.app`) by submitting transactions.  
- **Composability**: On-chain data can be used across the Base ecosystem (e.g., NFTs, apps, and services).  
- **Gas Credits**: A token-based system for paying for transaction costs on EVM chains.  
- **Integration Tools**: OnchainKit provides APIs and guides for developers to integrate Basenames into their apps.  
- **NFTs**: Specific NFTs (e.g., Summer Pass, Buildathon) are tied to unique identifiers (e.g., `base.eth`).

### Related Topics  
- **OnchainKit**: Directly linked to the Builder Network and tutorials in the documentation.  
- **Base Ecosystem Fund**: Connected to funding opportunities (e.g., Rounds Grants).  
- **Base Builds Channel**: A resource for developers to learn about on-chain tools and projects.  
- **FAQ**: References the FAQ section for further guidance on on-chain practices and tools.  
- **BNS Name Owners**: Connected to the BNS name ownership process and free name options (e.g., `basename.app`).

## Original Text
```
and other EVM chains.

Basenames are fully onchain, and therefore any information you publish is recorded onchain, requires a transaction, and will be broadly composable with the rest of the ecosystem. Please do not publish any information you do not wish to be onchain.

If you're a builder looking to integrate Basenames into your app,OnchainKitis the easiest way to get started (tutorial here). If you have ideas for new features or badges that you'd like to integrate with Basenames, we'd love to hear from you.

You can register a Basename for your app just like any other Basename. If a Basename for your app or project is not available, there is a good chance it was reserved.

Please reach out to our team or fill outthis formand we will reach out with instructions.
