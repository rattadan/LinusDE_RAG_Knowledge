### Document Overview  
This content outlines arbitration rules for resolving disputes between Arbitrum.io and its users, emphasizing individual claims, waiver of jury trials, and the governing Federal Arbitration Act.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Arbitration**: Disputes are resolved through binding arbitration rather than court litigation.  
- **Individual Claims**: Users can pursue claims individually, not as class or representative actions.  
- **Binding Arbitration**: Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.  
- **Waiver of Jury Trials**: Users waive the right to trial by jury.  
- **Federal Arbitration Act**: Governs the interpretation and enforcement of arbitration agreements.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Arbitration Process**: Disputes are resolved via arbitration, with the arbitrator’s decision final and binding.  
- **Consolidation Rules**: The arbitrator may not consolidate claims from multiple parties.  
- **Relief Limits**: Arbitrators can award relief only to the individual party’s claim, excluding public injunctive relief unless under specific legal exceptions.  
- **Governing Law**: The Federal Arbitration Act applies to enforce the arbitration agreement.  

### Related Topics  
- **Legal Compliance**: Connected to Arbitrum.io’s broader legal documentation (e.g., privacy policy, terms of service for other services).  
- **Arbitration Agreements**: Linked to similar terms in other platforms (e.g., Ethereum-based services).  
- **Federal Arbitration Act**: Tied to legal frameworks governing digital contracts and dispute resolution.

to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Offchain Labs are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

YOU AND OFFCHAIN LABS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND OFFCHAIN LABS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSONS OR PARTYS CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTYS INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
