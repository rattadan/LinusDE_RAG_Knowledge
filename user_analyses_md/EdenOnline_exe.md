Putting this tweet in the context of broader intentions:
The author seems to be positioning themselves (and presumably Eden Online) as a leader in the emerging Web3 gaming space. By mentioning Arbitrum specifically, they're aligning with a particular blockchain ecosystem to build credibility. The use of "is inevitable" suggests they're trying to frame Web3 gaming as the natural evolution of the industry, which supports their position if Eden Online is indeed among the top games. This tweet appears to serve multiple purposes: announcing an achievement, promoting their game, and advocating for Web3 gaming adoption.
