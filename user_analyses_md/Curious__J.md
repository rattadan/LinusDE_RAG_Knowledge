## Overview

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 5 keywords or tags for better postprocessing, based on the provided Twitter posts. The response needs to be concise and focused on the most distinctive patterns.

First, I need to look through the tweets and identify recurring themes or key terms. Let's go through the tweets one by one.

The first tweet mentions "Cosmos Hub Dex Incentive Mechanism Suggestion" and talks about points-based rewards. So "Cosmos Hub Dex" and "points-based incentives" are here.

Another tweet discusses the proposal to revert the community tax from 10% to 2%, mentioning AADAO and ICL. Terms like "community tax," "AADAO," and "ICL" come up here.

There's a mention of "MXE May" and a sell in May & go away strategy. That's a common trading strategy, so "sell in May" and "MXE May" might be relevant.

The tweet about the Dex on Cosmos Hub talks about building a super app with various protocols. Terms like "Cosmos Hub Dex" and "super app" are here.

Another tweet talks about "Vape to Earn" and "vaporware," which are negative terms related to crypto projects. So "vaporware" and "vape to earn" could be tags.

Now, compiling these ideas. The main themes are Cosmos Hub, Dex incentives, community tax, trading strategies (sell in May), and vaporware. The user wants keywords that are distinct and useful for postprocessing. So I need to pick the most significant ones.

"Cosmos Hub Dex" is a key project, "community tax" is a policy change, "sell in May" is a popular strategy, "vaporware" is a common term for unverified projects, and "points-based incentives" relate to the Dex reward system. 

I should check if these are distinct enough. "Cosmos Hub Dex" and "community tax" are specific to the Cosmos Hub project. "Sell in May" is a specific trading strategy. "Vaporware" is a term for unverified projects. "Points-based incentives" is a specific aspect of the Dex. 

Yes, these are all distinct and relevant. So the five tags would be: Cosmos Hub Dex, Community Tax, Sell in May, Vaporware, Points-Based Incentives.

3. **Sell in May**  
4. **Vaporware**  
5. **Points-Based Incentives**
