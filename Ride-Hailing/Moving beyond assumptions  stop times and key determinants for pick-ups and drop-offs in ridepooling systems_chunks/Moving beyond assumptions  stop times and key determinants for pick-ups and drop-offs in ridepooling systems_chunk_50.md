**Original Text:**

Considering that the stopping behaviour of AVs may differ
during PUDO events, follow-up empirical investigations should be undertaken. Conclusion
The duration required for PUDO events in DRT systems, such as ridepooling, impacts overall
service efficiency. Despite its significance, the literature has largely overlooked this parameter, leading to common assumptions in simulation studies. To close this research gap, we
analysed stop time data collected empirically through on-site observations during the operation of a ridepooling service in the Hanover region, Germany. Our data analysis revealed
that stop times are right-skewed and exhibit heterogeneous characteristics. We found a statistically significant difference between the stop time required for passenger boarding and
alighting, with pick-ups taking 64% longer than drop-offs. The results of each regression
model identified further determinants that significantly influence a PUDO eventâ€™s stop time.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is analyzing the stopping behavior of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) during Public-Private On-Demand Services (Pudos), specifically ride-pooling events, in the context of Distributed Rapid Transit (DRT) systems.

**Technical Details:**

1. **Stop Time**: The analysis focuses on determining the duration required for PUDO events in DRT systems, such as ride-pooling.
2. **Empirical Investigation**: The study employs on-site observations to collect data during the operation of a ride-pooling service in the Hanover region, Germany.
3. **Regression Modeling**: Two regression models are used to identify determinants that influence a PUDO event's stop time.

**Context:**

This chunk is building upon or connecting to the surrounding context by:

1. Exploring the impact of AVs on ride-pooling services and urban transport systems.
2. Recognizing the need for more research on the operational aspects of ride-pooling, particularly in DRT systems.
3. Highlighting the importance of stop time data collection during Pudos events to inform simulation studies.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

The current text chunk is requesting:

1. More research on the stopping behavior of AVs during Pudos events.
2. The identification of determinants that influence a PUDO event's stop time, which can be used as a reference for future analysis or simulation studies.

In terms of constraints, the text assumes access to the same DRT system and ride-pooling service being studied in this specific context.
