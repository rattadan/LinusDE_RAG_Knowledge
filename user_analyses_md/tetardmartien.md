Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided several tweets from an account and wants a summary with specific elements. First, I need to analyze the main topics. The tweets mention web3, a new social layer, a chainlet launch, and a fundraising event. So the main theme is web3 and blockchain projects.

Next, the language style and tone. The user uses abbreviations like RT, which suggests a casual, informal tone. The messages are concise, with hashtags and URLs, indicating a quick, direct communication style. The tone is enthusiastic and promotional, using words like "launching," "raising," and "support."
