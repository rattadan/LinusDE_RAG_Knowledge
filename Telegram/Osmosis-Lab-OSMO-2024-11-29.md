## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different people discussing Cosmos, Osmosis, IBC assets, and some user experience issues.

First, I need to identify the main topics. There's a lot about wstETH on Osmosis and Neutron. nachodon had a bad experience where after swapping ETH to wstETH on Osmosis and moving to Neutron, the asset wasn't recognized. The Neutron team suggested it's a double-wrapped asset from Osmosis, causing IBC recognition issues. This points to a problem with asset interoperability in Cosmos IBC.

Then, there's a discussion about user experience and frontends. BasementNodes and nachodon debate whether the issue is with the apps not supporting certain assets or if it's a systemic problem in Cosmos. nachodon argues that assets should be usable everywhere once sent via IBC, but current frontends don't handle this well.

Other points: Someone mentions a Telegram bot for Cosmos Directory, a link to a support site, and some tokenomics discussions. Vraneshi asks about OSMO tokenomics, and jasbanza refers to a burn proposal. Also, markzuev14 had a withdrawal issue needing gas fees.

Key decisions or actions: The need for better frontend design to handle IBC assets, addressing the double-wrapping issue on Osmosis, and the OSMO burn proposal. Also, the importance of user experience in Cosmos adoption versus chains like Solana.

I should structure the summary around these issues, highlighting the technical problems (double-wrapped assets, IBC recognition), user experience concerns, and tokenomics updates. Keep it concise, maybe bullet points or a short paragraph. Make sure to mention the main participants and the implications of their discussions.

**Summary of Key Points and Decisions:**  
1. **wstETH IBC Recognition Issue:** nachodon reported a poor user experience after swapping ETH for wstETH on Osmosis and transferring it to Neutron, where it wasn‚Äôt recognized as an IBC asset. The Neutron team suggested Osmosis‚Äô alloyed assets system may have created a "doubly wrapped" version, undermining IBC interoperability.  
2. **Frontend Design Criticism:** nachodon emphasized that Cosmos apps must better handle cross-chain assets to avoid confusion,

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by going through each message to see what they're talking about.

First, there's a mention of "top cosmos directory telegram bot" and getting a pool address from @Cosmos_Directory_Bot. So Cosmos directory and Telegram bot stuff is one topic. Then "top block explorer" and checking a pool address on chainsco.pe for Osmosis. That seems related to block explorers and pool addresses.

HOSS_ibc talks about "token factory," so that's a separate topic. There's a user asking about investing in a currency and its price prediction, which is about investment and price speculation. 

Another message from HOSS_ibc asks about "sherpa denom ca," which I think refers to a specific token or denomination in the Cosmos ecosystem. The Osmosis statbot mentions their support site, so Osmosis support is a topic. 

BasementNodes and nachodon discuss front-end issues with assets not being recognized across chains, specifically wstETH on Osmosis and Neutron. This relates to IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) and asset recognition problems. There's also a mention of double-wrapped assets and user experience issues in Cosmos/Neutron. 

Someone talks about using SquidRouter, which is a cross-chain bridge, so bridges and cross-chain transfers come up. Another part mentions withdrawing USDY from Osmosis to Mantra and gas fees issues, which ties into token withdrawals and transaction fees. 

Discussions about Osmo tokenomics, inflation reduction, and token burning are there, so that's about Osmo's economic model. There's also a mention of the Osmo decoupling process and selling pressure due to bad pairings, which relates to Osmo's market dynamics. 

Links to Osmosis documentation and educational resources are provided, so that's another topic. Lastly, there's a question about whether Osmo is fake, which might relate to legitimacy concerns. 

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be Cosmos ecosystem, Osmosis blockchain, Telegram bots (like Cosmos_Directory_Bot), block explorers, IBC asset recognition issues, token factory, wstETH and its wrapping problems, cross-chain bridges (SquidRouter), USDY withdrawal issues, Osmo tokenomics, inflation, token burning, Osm

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from a Telegram group related to Cosmos and Osmosis. I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first few messages from BasementNodes. They're talking about getting pool addresses from a bot and checking block explorers. These seem neutral; just informational or pointing to resources. No clear positive or negative language here.

Then there's a message from HOSS_ibc asking about a token factory. Neutral again, just a question without emotional tone.

The user_7550119373 says they're still investing but unsure about the currency's future. That sounds negative because they're expressing uncertainty and possibly anxiety about their investment.

BasementNodes follows up with questions about pool addresses and wallets. These are queries, so neutral.

HOSS_ibc asks about a sherpa denom, which is a straightforward question. Neutral.

Osmosis_statbot provides support links. This is helpful but neutral, not showing emotion.

Later, BasementNodes and nachodon have a back-and-forth. nachodon is frustrated about user experience issues with wstETH on Osmosis and Neutron, mentioning it's a bad experience and systemic failures. That's definitely negative. BasementNodes responds with some dismissive remarks like "complain harder next time," which is negative as well. The conversation seems to be a conflict, so both sides are negative here.

Griffin_web3 shares some links and mentions a coffee break. The links are neutral, but the coffee message is positive, showing a friendly tone.

Dharmil asks about a price alert bot, and griffin_web3 responds. These are neutral, just inquiries and answers.

Markzuev14 has issues withdrawing USDY and mentions insufficient funds. That's negative due to the problem faced. Others helping him out with gas fees and addresses are neutral or positive, offering assistance.

Mrtiahou shares a forum link and talks about Osmo decoupling, which might indicate a negative sentiment towards Osmo's value capture. His message about having to sell Osmo first to pay with other tokens also seems negative.

Vraneshi discusses Osmo tokenomics and sell pressure from rewards. These are concerns about the project's direction, so negative.

Kychuli provides links to documentation. Neutral, informative.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any tasks or decisions mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first few messages mention getting a pool address from a Telegram bot and checking it on a block explorer. That seems like an action item: someone needs to retrieve the pool address from Cosmos_Directory_Bot and verify it on chainsco.pe. 

Then there's a message about token factory from HOSS_ibc. Not sure if that's an action item or just a topic. Maybe if someone needs to set up or use a token factory, but it's not clear. I'll note it as a possible action but might need to check context. 

The user_7550119373 message is about investing and not knowing the price movement. That's more of a question or concern, not an action item. 

BasementNodes asks if the pool address is in someone's wallet. That's a question, but maybe the next step is to check the wallet. 

HOSS_ibc asks for the "sherpa denom ca". Not sure what "ca" stands for here, but it's a request for information. If "ca" is a specific term like contract address, then the action item would be to provide that. 

There's a support link from osmosis_statbot, which is just a resource. 

BasementNodes and nachodon discuss user experience issues with IBC assets not being recognized. This seems like a problem but the action items here might be to improve frontend design or ensure asset recognition across chains. 

nachodon mentions moving wstETH from Osmosis to Neutron and not being recognized. The next steps here could involve checking the bridge or contacting support teams. 

griffin_web3 provides some links and assistance, like sending gas tokens. So action items here include sending gas to markzuev14 and suggesting using specific tools. 

markzuev14's issue with withdrawing USDY and insufficient fees leads to griffin_web3 asking for their Osmo address to send gas. So the next step is to assist with gas fees. 

Other messages discuss tokenomics, burns, and support resources, which might lead to actions like reviewing burn proposals or visiting support sites. 

I need to make sure I'm not
