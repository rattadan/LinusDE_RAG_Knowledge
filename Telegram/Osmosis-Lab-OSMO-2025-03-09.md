## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The text seems to be a chat log with various users discussing Osmosis and related issues. Let me go through each message step by step.

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot providing a support site link. Then user_5462303026 says something in German about being asked and not saying anything. Khuwarzmi shares a link to a Twitter post. Another user expresses enthusiasm for Osmosis with rocket and heart emojis. 

BasementNodes and Devilmen76 are talking about adding a chain. Devilmen76 mentions that the chain is grey and can't be added, and BasementNodes suggests using chains.keplr.app. There's a mention of the Telegram being abandoned and Tfm still working. GPKwee provides a link for using TFM to bridge tokens. 

Then there's a discussion about privacy settings from osmosis_statbot and GPKwee, advising to change settings to restrict phone number visibility and calls. Devilmen76 tried to claim an airdrop but PLQ doesn't support Ledger, so GPKwee suggests using Cosmos apps on Ledger with Keplr. Later, Devilmen76 asks for a link to see APR on Cosmos, and GPKwee provides Mintscan. 

Another part mentions autocompounding, with GPKwee suggesting restake.app. Finally, user_6658531403 comments on Osmosis and Osmosis squared, trading for Osmos and rest in charts.

Key points here are support links, issues adding the Planq chain, privacy settings advice, bridging via TFM, using Ledger with Keplr, APR and chain info via Mintscan, and autocompounding via Restake. Also, the Telegram being abandoned. Decisions or actions mentioned are changing privacy settings, using specific tools like chains.keplr.app, TFM, Mintscan, Restake, and addressing the chain addition problem.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without getting bogged down in every message. Focus on the main issues and solutions provided. Also note the abandoned Telegram and the advice to use official support channels. The user's problem with PLQ not supporting Ledger and the alternative solutions suggested. The autocompounding and APR links. And the comment

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and understand what they're talking about.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's about visiting the support site. So "support site" might be a topic. Then there's a user in German saying something like "You asked me and I said nothing!" which seems like a personal interaction, maybe not a main topic. 

Next, Khuwarzmi shares a link to a Twitter status. That's probably about "social media" or "Twitter link". Then another user mentions Osmosis with rocket and heart emojis, so maybe "Osmosis platform" or positive sentiment towards it. 

BasementNodes says "I will ask the guy" which is vague, but later messages from them mention issues with connecting to PLQ and adding chains. So topics here could be "PLQ chain connection issues" and "chain addition problems". The osmosis_statbot also shares links to Telegram, Discord, and webpage for Planq Network, so "Planq Network official channels" is another topic. 

Devilmen76 and BasementNodes are discussing issues with adding the chain via Keplr and Restake apps. Links to those sites are provided. So maybe "chain addition via Keplr" and "Restake app". Then there's a mention of TFM (Trustless Financial Markets?) with a bridge link, so "TFM bridge" could be a topic. 

Devilmen76 also talks about privacy settings, specifically their phone number being visible. The statbot gives steps to adjust privacy settings, so "privacy settings adjustment" is important. 

Another part is about claiming an airdrop but PLQ not supporting Ledger, leading to "PLQ Ledger compatibility issues". They also mention auto-compounding, which might be a feature they're looking for, so "auto-compounding feature request". 

GPKwee provides links to mintscan and Osmosis zone for checking chains and APR, so "Cosmos chain/APR tracking" and "Osmosis zone platform". 

Lastly, a user comments on Osmosis squared devaluing Osmosis, which could be "Osmosis Squared impact". 

I need to ensure that each topic is distinct and captures the essence without overlapping. Let

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot providing support links. That's neutral, just informational.

Next, user_5462303026 wrote in German: "Du hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt!" which translates to "You asked me and I didn't say anything!"

BasementNodes says "I will ask the guy". Neutral.

Another statbot message with links, neutral.

BasementNodes: "Huh so weird". That's a bit negative, expressing confusion or displeasure.

Devilmen76: "No way Max, thanks for your time". "No way" could be negative, but "thanks" is positive. Maybe mixed, but overall negative because of the refusal?

Devilmen76: "I did, for that reason I‚Äôve asked before but doesn‚Äôt work". Frustration here, negative.

Devilmen76: "The chain is grey and cannot to be added". Complaining about an issue, negative.

Devilmen76: "Connect to plq doesn‚Äôt work" ‚Äì Negative.

GPKwee asks "what is not working? withdraw?" ‚Äì Neutral inquiry.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. I need to go through each message and identify any tasks, decisions made, or steps that someone should take.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot at 22:58:25. It's directing users to the support site. That's more of an informational message, not an action item. Then user_5462303026's message is in German, translating to "You asked me and I said nothing!" Not sure if that's an action item. Maybe not. 

Khuwarzmi shares a link to a Twitter status. Not an action item. User_5920371783 just expresses enthusiasm for Osmosis, so no action there. 

BasementNodes at 13:15:28 says "I will ask the guy." That sounds like an action item because they're committing to do something. Then osmosis_statbot again provides links to Telegram, Discord, and webpage. Those are resources but not action items unless someone is supposed to visit them. But the bot is just sharing links, so maybe not. 

BasementNodes says "Huh so weird" ‚Äì not an action. Devilmen76 at 13:15:13 says "No way Max, thanks for your time." Maybe a decision to not proceed with something, but not clear. Then at 13:14:44, Devilmen76 says they tried adding from a site but it didn't work. That's a past action, not a next step. 

BasementNodes at 13:14:17 suggests trying adding the chain from restske.app. That's a next step or action item. Devilmen76 reports the chain is grey and can't be added. BasementNodes then provides a link to chains.keplr.app and says "Add the chain" and "The telegram has been totally abandoned..." and "Tfm still works?" 

GPKwee at 13:11:31 provides a TFM link for bridging. Devilmen76 says connecting to plq doesn't work. GPKwee asks if withdrawal isn't working. Devilmen76 confirms "Doesn‚Äôt work." Then some personal messages about contacts
