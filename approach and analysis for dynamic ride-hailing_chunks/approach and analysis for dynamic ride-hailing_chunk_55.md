**Original Text:**

In this section, we present our own repositioning approach that
overcomes both issues. The main idea is to create zones around each
parking lot (referred to as parking lot zones), covering the area that
can be reached by the vehicles in these parking lots within a specific
timeframe. Later, we will also refer to this area as the range of a parking
lot, a vehicle, or a request. By setting this timeframe to the maximum
waiting time ùëáùëä and assuming that the incoming requests follow a
Poisson distribution, we can calculate for each lot the probability of at
least one missed request due to undersupply in this area. In the repositioning process, these probabilities can be minimized to maximize the
number of served requests. We will refer to this strategy as the undersupply probability strategy.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining a technical approach for dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, focusing on rebalancing strategies.

1. **Technical details:**
   - The authors propose creating "parking lot zones" around each parking lot.
   - Each zone covers an area that can be reached by vehicles within a specific timeframe (max waiting time ùëáùëä).
   - They use the Poisson distribution to model incoming requests.

2. **Context building upon:**
   - This section builds upon the surrounding context of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, specifically highlighting the challenges of undersupply.
   - It mentions simulation and modeling approaches (e.g., Bischoff & Maciejewski, Braverman et al.) as relevant to understanding the problem.

3. **Requirements and conditions:**
   - The strategy is designed for rebalancing in ride-hailing systems, indicating that it's aimed at addressing issues related to vehicle assignment or demand forecasting.
   - The authors mention that they aim to maximize served requests by minimizing the probability of missing them due to undersupply in each zone.
