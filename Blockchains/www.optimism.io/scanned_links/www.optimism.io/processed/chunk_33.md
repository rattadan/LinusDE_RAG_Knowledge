## Source Context
*From: https://www.optimism.io/*

### Document Overview  
This content describes the Optimism Gateway Interface (Bridge Front-End), its role in connecting Web3 wallets to OP Mainnet, bridging assets between blockchains, and the Optimist NFT Service, which allows minting non-fungible tokens with custom profiles and interacting with smart contracts on OP Mainnet.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Gateway Interface (Bridge Front-End)**: A tool for connecting Web3 wallets to OP Mainnet and bridging assets between blockchains.  
- **Blockchain Interoperability**: Seamless transfer of digital assets between Ethereum, OP Mainnet, and other public blockchains.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated protocols on OP Mainnet that enable transactions, attestations, and NFT mints.  
- **Optimist NFT Service**: A platform for minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with custom profiles (PFPs) and interacting with the AttestationStation smart contract.  
- **AttestationStation**: A decentralized smart contract on OP Mainnet that allows users to post public attestations about their NFTs.  
- **On-chain Persistence**: Data is permanently stored on the blockchain and cannot be deleted or altered.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Gateway Interface Functionality**: Users can send messages directly to Ethereum, OP Mainnet, or third-party interfaces, with routing through decentralized apps (DApps) as needed.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Bridges interact with Ethereum, OP Mainnet, or third-party bridges (e.g., via the AttestationStation).  
- **NFT Minting**: Users mint Optimist NFTs by connecting their Web3 wallet, linking their address permanently, and using the AttestationStation to create public attestations.  
- **Technical Specifications**: The Gateway Interface is available at [this link](https://www.optimism.io/), and the AttestationStation is a smart contract on OP Mainnet.  

### Related Topics  
- **Gateway Interface**: Connected to the Optimism documentation (e.g., [Optimism.io](https://www.optimism.io/)).  
- **AttestationStation**: Details are referenced in the NFT Service description.  
- **Blockchain Interoperability**: Related to broader topics like cross-chain bridges and decentralized applications (DApps) in Optimism's documentation.

```
user interface (the Gateway Interface) that enables you to connect a compatible non-custodial software wallet (Web3 Wallet) and initiate messages to the OP Mainnet, and to bridge digital assets between the Ethereum and OP Mainnet public blockchains, and between OP Mainnet and certain other public blockchains. The Gateway Interface (also known as the Bridge Front-End) is availablehere. Depending on how you use the Gateway Interface, (i) these messages may be sent directly to Ethereum, OP Mainnet or other public blockchains or routed through various third-party interfaces and decentralized applications, and (ii) the bridging smart contracts with which you interact may be inherent to Ethereum, OP Mainnet, or other public blockchains themselves, or independently developed and deployed by various third parties (Third-Party Bridges).
- Optimist NFTs, PFPs and AttestationStation:The ability, if you are eligible, to connect your compatible Web3 Wallet to OP Mainnet and mint non-fungible tokens (Optimist NFTs) with customized profile pictures (PFPs) and interact with certain related smart contracts deployed on OP Mainnet (collectively, the Optimist NFT Service). When you mint an Optimist NFT, your Optimist NFT will be permanently linked to your wallet address and will not be transferable, and other users will be able to use the attestation smart contract deployed on OP Mainnet known as the AttestationStation (which you can read more about here) to post permanent, publicly available attestations about, among other things, your Optimist NFT. When you or others submit information or attestations in minting an Optimist NFT or using the AttestationStation, you and they are interacting directly with OP Mainnet and smart contracts deployed on OP Mainnet and entering that information into an on-chain permanent repository, where it will be publicly accessible and cannot be deleted.
