## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to summarize this chat text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The text seems to be a conversation between several users, including BasementNodes, iconoicono, keyleu, itsmeartc, and others, discussing various topics related to a Telegram group and some blockchain projects.

First, I need to parse through the messages and identify the main themes. There's a lot of discussion about spam bots and moderation. For example, BasementNodes mentions wanting to reach out to the Rose bot team to add a feature that bans users based on their username. There's also talk about implementing filters, IQ tests for joining the chat, and using the /mute feature for specific users like AJ. Keyleu is concerned about leaking members and suggests that high tariffs might be bad. They also mention that the Rose bot isn't working as expected with username filters.

Then there are several messages about blockchain projects like IBC Eureka, Babylon Phase 2 launch, Terra liquidity alliance offering 200% APR, and others. These include promotional links and discussions about airdrops, staking, and trading. Some users are asking about eligibility for airdrops or where to trade certain tokens.

Technical discussions include using Amazon Mechanical Turk for image recognition tasks, playwright with image recognition AI, and checking TG API settings for security. There's a mention of a hacked Rose bot spreading child porn groups, which seems urgent.

I should categorize the summary into sections: Moderation Issues, Blockchain Projects & Airdrops, Technical Solutions, and Other Discussions. Highlight the key decisions like contacting Rose bot team, considering filters and mute features, and the urgency of the hacked bot. For blockchain parts, note the main projects and their updates. Technical solutions proposed by users like using Mechanical Turk or playwright. Also, mention the promotional activities and user concerns about eligibility and trading.

Need to make sure the summary is concise, captures all main points, and separates different topics clearly. Avoid including too much detail on individual messages unless they're part of a key decision or recurring issue. Check for any other important points like the user info doxxing incident mentioned by keyleu. Also, note the spamming of links and the discussion about KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) for promotion.

Alright, putting it all together now.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or subjects.

Starting with the earliest messages, there's a mention of "IBC Eureka" and integration with multiple blockchains like Ethereum, Cosmos, and Babylon. That seems like a key topic related to blockchain interoperability. Then, there's a lot of discussion about airdrops, specifically from projects like Arkeo, Babylon, and WCT. Airdrops are definitely a main topic here.

Looking further, several messages talk about spam bots and moderation tools. Users are discussing the Rose bot, wanting features like username filters, bans, and mute functions. The frustration with scammers and the need for better moderation tools like a custom Rose bot or using Mechanical Turk for image recognition comes up multiple times. So, spam moderation and bot management are important topics.

There's also a mention of a Terra liquidity alliance offering high APR, which relates to DeFi and liquidity provision. The user discussing borrowing and swapping on Terra's platform indicates that DeFi strategies and yield farming are topics here.

Another point is the discussion about Mechanical Turk, not in the context of Turkey but as a service for tasks. The user clarifies it's related to Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which is about outsourcing tasks to human workers. That's a separate topic from the blockchain ones.

Additionally, there's talk about KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and promoting invites on Twitter, which ties into marketing and community growth strategies. The mention of needing to hire KOLs and spamming invites suggests that's another main topic.

Some messages reference specific projects like Elys Network, SEDA Protocol, Nillion, and others, but those might be examples under the broader blockchain integrations. Also, there's a mention of a project called Dominia-Plus and IXO Chain upgrades, which could fall under blockchain updates or specific projects.

The user also talks about a "death ray autokick/bans" and "wheel of greetings," which seem like specific features or issues within their group's moderation tools. These might be part of the spam moderation topic.

There's a mention of an IQ test to join the chat, which relates to community management strategies to filter members. That's another sub-topic under community moderation.

Putting it all together, the main topics are likely: blockchain interoper

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

First, the text includes several users discussing things like bots, spamming invites, KOLs (which I think are Key Opinion Leaders), and technical issues with the Rose bot. There's mention of banning users, filtering usernames, and some frustration about the bot's features not working as expected. 

Looking at specific messages: 

- BasementNodes says, "please do not eat" which seems odd but maybe in context of not eating cookies? Not sure yet. 
- Later, "we can't afford KOLs so you bunch will have to do I guess" ‚Äì this sounds negative, indicating they can't afford influencers and are resigned to handle it themselves.
- "start spamming cac invite on twitter bois" ‚Äì "bois" is informal, maybe positive or neutral, but "spamming" has a negative connotation.
- "imagine the smell" ‚Äì could be literal or metaphorical, maybe negative.
- Iconoicono asks about cookies, which is neutral, but then there's a link to a YouTube video. Other messages mention Mechanical Turk, which is a reference to Amazon's service, so maybe discussing outsourcing tasks?
- Keyleu and others talk about needing mute and ban features, leaking members, wanting an IQ test to join ‚Äì these indicate frustration or attempts to manage a chaotic group, leaning negative.
- There's a message from MissRose_bot muting someone, which shows moderation actions happening.
- BasementNodes mentions someone hacking the Rose description to spread child porn groups, which is definitely a strong negative.
- Other technical discussions about APIs, permissions, and bot features might be neutral but in the context of problems, so maybe negative.
- Some messages about promotions, airdrops, and projects like IBC Eureka, Babylon Phase 2, Dominia-Plus are positive announcements, but they might be neutral if they're just informational.
- There's a lot of frustration with the Rose bot team not being responsive, needing to pay monthly for custom versions, which is negative.
- Some sarcastic or humorous remarks like "you want to be alone here" or "they are playing 6d chess" could be negative or neutral depending on context.

I notice that many messages are about dealing with spam, scammers, bot issues, and the need for better moderation tools.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and see what's being discussed. 

Starting from the top, the most recent messages are at the beginning. The first message from iconoicono is a YouTube link, but no clear action item there. Then BasementNodes says "please do not eat" ‚Äì maybe a joke, not an action. The message before that is iconoicono asking about the type of cookies, which seems like a question but not an action.

Looking further down, BasementNodes at 22:52:37 mentions making a ban bot. That's a request. Then there's discussion about filtering usernames and banning based on that. Keyleu and others talk about needing features like mute and ban for specific users (AJ and scammers). MissRose_bot mutes Ajcrypto456 for 30 minutes, which is an action taken. 

BasementNodes also suggests reaching out to the Rose bot team to add a username-based ban feature. That's a next step. There's a mention of using Amazon Mechanical Turk for image recognition tasks, which could be an action item. Rattadan talks about checking TG API settings if Rose was hacked, so that's another possible action.

Other points include promoting a Twitter campaign for CAC invites, hiring KOLs (influencers), and attending weekly workshops. Also, some messages discuss technical issues like filters not working, leading to possible decisions to implement new solutions. The user info doxxing incident might require checking privacy settings.

I need to list all these as action items, decisions, or next steps. Make sure to note who is responsible where mentioned, like BasementNodes reaching out to Rose bot team. Also, some messages are just comments or observations, so those might not be actions unless they lead to a decision. For example, the discussion about the mute feature led to MissRose_bot taking action. 

Wait, the user info messages from MissRose_bot might be part of the bot's functionality, but keyleu's reaction about doxxing is a concern, so maybe a next step is to address privacy. Also, the mention of using Playwright and image recognition AI could be a technical action item.

I should compile all these into a structured list, grouping similar actions and noting the responsible parties or the actions taken.
