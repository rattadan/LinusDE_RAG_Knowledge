## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the key points and decisions. The messages are from different users on a platform, maybe Telegram, discussing crypto projects like Cosmos, TON, and others.

Starting from the latest messages and moving up. The user_5941115938 buys something and says it's "absolute fire," so that's positive feedback. Then there's cosmotick and BasementNodes talking about using other networks only for bridging to TON, and that Telegram might ban other blockchain apps. So there's a restriction here. 

itsmeartc mentions using two networks, Ton and Cosmos, which BasementNodes warns about getting "nuked" if not compliant. Then there's a birthday message for NFT News, which seems like a celebration but maybe not crucial. 

SuperEra is promoting a wallet submission for a token drop, with a deadline on March 27th. Tzouzepe13 is encouraging voting for SuperEra. AnubisPhy mentions staking PLQ for an airdrop with Astonic. 

SithLordx has several messages about preferring projects with real use cases like Jackal, Akash, and Depin, criticizing the Cosmos ecosystem for funding unnecessary DEXs. There's also a mention of a token price not mattering as much as fundamentals. 

MissRose_bot mutes user_5941115938 for discussing politics. Other messages include sharing links, community calls, and some personal comments about altcoins and BTC. 

I need to focus on decisions made, like BasementNodes' rule about networks, SuperEra's token submission deadline, the promotion of staking PLQ, SithLordx's critique of Cosmos funding and his preferred projects, and the mute action taken. Also, user_5941115938's purchase and positive comment. 

Avoid less important stuff like birthday messages, repeated links, and off-topic comments. Make sure the summary is concise, highlighting the main points and decisions without extra details. Check for any other key actions or announcements. Maybe the community call reminder from wlkatja. 

So structure the summary around these elements: network restrictions, token submissions, airdrop promotions, ecosystem critiques, moderation actions, and positive user feedback. Keep each point brief and in key bullet points.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or specific terms that stand out.

Looking at the text, there's a lot of mention of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Words like TON (Telegram Open Network), Cosmos, Atom, Osmosis, and various tokens such as $PLQ, $CULT, $OSMO, $BERA pop up. There are also references to specific protocols and platforms like Warden Protocol, nRide, Akash, Jackal, Depin, and others. 

Some messages talk about airdrops and staking, which are common topics in crypto communities. There's a link to a Telegram community call and mentions of beta testing, which might relate to community engagement. The user also mentions NFT News birthdays, so NFTs are another topic. 

There's a critique of the Cosmos ecosystem funding DEXs over more useful apps, which points to discussions about blockchain applications and funding priorities. Storage and compute resources (like GPUs) are mentioned in the context of projects like Jackal and Akash, indicating that's a key area of interest. 

The user's frustration with Solana deleting an ad and comments about altcoins versus BTC maxis suggest topics around cryptocurrency marketing and market dynamics. Also, terms like "alpha" and "speculative assets" hint at investment strategies and market speculation. 

I should also note the mentions of specific wallets (Jeet wallet) and events like the Binance listing for $NIL. Governance and voting come up with the poll for Cosmos contributors and the discussion about grants. 

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be:

- TON network
- Cosmos ecosystem
- Blockchain applications
- Airdrops (e.g., $CULT, $BERA)
- Staking (specifically $PLQ)
- Cryptocurrency projects (Atom, Osmosis, Warden Protocol, nRide, Akash, Jackal, Depin, Filecoin, Render)
- NFTs (Happy Birthday to NFT News)
- Community engagement (Discord calls, beta testing)
- Token prices and market dynamics (altcoins vs BTC)
- Funding priorities in blockchain development (DEXs vs useful apps)
- Storage and compute resources (GPU usage)
- Social media promotion (Telegram,

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages carefully.

First, looking at the positive messages. There's "Bought some today thanks man" and "Absolute fire" from user_5941115938, which seem positive. Then cosmotick says "Thank for example if is true" and "I don't know if I can post the link because i not want admin banned me" ‚Äì the first might be neutral but the second shows concern, maybe neutral or slightly negative. BasementNodes mentions something about blockchain apps on Telegram getting nuked, which is negative. Itsmeartc and others discuss networks, which seems neutral. 

There's a lot of discussion about Cosmos, TON, and other cryptocurrencies. Some users are excited about projects like Wardenprotocol's community call and beta testing, which are positive. SuperEra and Tzouzepe13 have messages about voting and support, which are positive. However, SithLordx has several critical comments about the Cosmos ecosystem, funding DEXs over useful apps, and the state of altcoins, which are negative. The user_5941115938 also expresses frustration about Solana deleting an ad and calls others "fucking pussies," which is definitely negative. 

The bot messages from Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot and others are neutral or positive, focusing on community engagement and project developments. The repeated "Happy Birthday" messages are positive. MissRose_bot muting a user for politics is neutral, just enforcing rules. 

I need to weigh the positive and negative comments. There are multiple negative points from SithLordx and user_5941115938, but also several positive and neutral messages. The overall sentiment might be mixed, but since there are more positive and neutral messages compared to the negative ones, maybe the overall sentiment is positive. However, the negative comments are quite strong. Wait, but the user is asking for positive, negative, or neutral. Let me check again.

The positive messages include thanks, support, congratulations, community calls, and excitement about projects. The negative ones are criticism towards ecosystems, frustration, and some harsh language. Neutral messages are informational or rule enforcement. The majority might be neutral with a mix of positive and negative. But the user wants a single label. Maybe the positive and negative cancel

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any parts that indicate a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a next step in a process.

Starting with the latest messages. The user_5941115938 at 22:51:48 says "Bought some today thanks man." That's a decision made‚Äîthey bought something, probably a cryptocurrency or token. Then another message from the same user at 22:51:40 says "Absolute fire," which might be a positive reaction but not an action item. 

Looking at cosmotick's messages: "And if you right i remove this shit üòÇ i love only atom and atom friendly" ‚Äì this seems like a decision to remove something if proven wrong, but the wording is a bit unclear. Maybe they're saying if someone is right, they'll remove their post? Not sure. Then "Thank for example if is true. But if you correct cosmos boy need or telegram on cosmos or social like telegram" ‚Äì this is a bit confusing. Maybe they're thanking someone if an example is true, but there's a mention of needing Telegram on Cosmos or social platforms. Not sure if that's an action item. 

BasementNodes at 22:28:29: "can only use other networks for the sole purpose of bridging funds to TON network" ‚Äì this is a restriction or a decision about network usage. So action item here could be that users should only use other networks to bridge funds to TON. 

itsmeartc's messages: "Ton and Cosmos" and "maybe they are using 2 networks" ‚Äì not sure if that's an action item. Maybe just a statement of fact. 

Earlier, SuperEra at 17:10:50 shares a link about $CULT members and submitting $OSMO wallets to the discord.gg/architectsnft link, submissions close March 27th. That's a clear action item: submit OSMO wallets by March 27th. 

Tzouzepe13 is encouraging others to vote for SuperEra in a poll, so next steps there would be to vote for SuperEra. 

AnubisPhy mentions st
