## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 33

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Larger tripdemand density allowed for better trip matching and results in SAV VMT savings of up to 28%. The constant mode share assumption through these scenarios meant that the effective savings in
total VMT only improved by about 5% more than savings in the current trip-density scenario. If
mode share is not a significant concern, better utilization of a smaller fleet in the higher tripdensity scenarios may be sufficient to achieve similar VMT savings at the cost of not meeting
trip requests. The 25x scenario shows a large spike in VMT added when stops are provided at 0.5
mi spacing. This may point toward a larger fleet requirement or more seats on the SAV to
manage all the demand that is focused at fewer stops. However, there would be a drop in SAV
demand if maximum response thresholds were not relaxed. Two smaller fleet sizes were tested to
reveal that VMT savings can be higher (up to two times) with fleet sizes cut by a third, but stops
no longer help boost VMT savings.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

The current text chunk describes the potential trip matching effect of increased demand density on Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV) Vehicle-to-Motor Vehicle (V2M) trips. Specifically:

* Larger trip demands allow for better trip matching, leading to SAV VMT savings of up to 28%.
* Constant mode share assumption in these scenarios means that the effective savings in total VMT is only about 5% more than in a current trip-density scenario.
* The need for better utilization of a smaller fleet may be sufficient to achieve similar VMT savings at the cost of not meeting trip requests, with the 25x scenario showing a large spike in VMT added when stops are provided at 0.5 mi spacing.

**Context and Connections:**

The current text chunk connects to the surrounding context by:

* Referencing previous discussions on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance and the importance of understanding the impact of demand density on SAV trips.
* Providing an overview of various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems and operational strategies.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

The text mentions two specific requirements or conditions:

* Better utilization of a smaller fleet in higher trip-density scenarios to achieve similar VMT savings at the cost of not meeting trip requests.
* Relaxing maximum response thresholds to increase VMT savings, but with the caveat that stops would no longer help boost VMT savings.

Overall, this chunk provides technical details and parameters on how increased demand density affects SAV trips, as well as context and requirements for understanding these effects.
