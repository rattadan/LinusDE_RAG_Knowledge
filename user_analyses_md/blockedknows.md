# User Analysis: blockedknows

## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's analyze this tweet step by step. The user is asking, "Whats something that attracts you the most?" followed by a chart link. The image in the tweet shows a cryptocurrency chart, maybe Bitcoin or Ethereum.

First, the main topics. The question is about attraction, but paired with the chart, it's likely about what attracts people to cryptocurrencies. The chart suggests data-driven decisions, so the theme could be crypto investments and trends.

Language style and tone: The message is brief and informal. Starting with a question invites engagement. The use of a chart implies a focus on visual data, maybe trying to spark curiosity or discussion about crypto movements.

Legitimacy evaluation: The tweet looks genuine but could be part of a strategy to engage followers about crypto. Need to check if the account is verified, but since it's blocked, that might indicate spam or scams. However, the content itself—asking a question and sharing a chart—is legitimate, though the account's blocked status is a red flag.

Ecosystem/project: The chart is of a cryptocurrency, but without more context, it's hard to tell which one. Maybe Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a lesser-known coin. If the account has a history of promoting certain projects, that's relevant, but here it's unclear.

Author's character: The communication is open-ended with a question, suggesting the author values interaction. The chart might indicate they're data-oriented. The account name "blockedknows" could imply they were blocked for spamming, so possible motivation is self-promotion or pushing an agenda. Emotional tendency might be manipulative, using questions to hook people into looking at the chart, maybe for a crypto they're trying to promote. Decision-making seems opportunistic, leveraging visual content and engagement tactics to push their message.

Putting it into context, if this account frequently posts crypto charts and questions, they might be trying to build a community around crypto trading or pump a specific coin. However, being blocked suggests they might have a history of violating platform rules.

Keywords: cryptocurrency, investment, engagement tactic, data visualization, potential scam.
