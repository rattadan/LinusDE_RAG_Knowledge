## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects discussed.

Starting with the first few messages, there's talk about reaching out to teams and validators for an event, mentioning Cosmos Voice podcast. So topics here might be community events, networking, and podcast participation. Then there's a mention of "make lunc great again" and discussions about Terra Classic's recovery and its role in the Cosmos ecosystem. That points to LUNC recovery, Terra Classic, and community efforts.

Looking at the messages from EternalBytes and others, there's a Chihuahua chain update and HUAHUASwap testing phase. That's a separate topic related to Cosmos ecosystem projects. Then there's a question about Namada to Osmosis deposits and issues with Terraport's IBC bridge on mobile, which relates to technical aspects and specific tools in the Cosmos network.

The user also mentions a blog post about the Middle East conflict affecting crypto prices and LUNC's status. That's another topic: impact of global events on crypto. There's a lot of references to community strength, surprising others, and being community-owned, so community-driven initiatives and resilience are themes.

Other parts talk about projects like Juris Protocol, OmniFlixNetwork with their suite of tools (Media Node Dashboard, InSync, StreamSwap), and Hexxagon's services. These are specific projects within the Cosmos ecosystem. Also, mentions of Telegram groups, websites like Luncverse.io, and events like the Interchain Summit in Berlin indicate collaboration and promotion efforts.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any recurring topics. Let me scan through again. There's a lot about LUNC, Terra Classic, Cosmos events, IBC bridges, validators, community engagement, specific projects like HUAHUASwap, Namada, Terraport, OmniFlix, and Hexxagon. Also, the importance of developers and dapps, and some discussions about mobile app issues.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be around community events and networking, LUNC recovery and Terra Classic's resurgence, Cosmos ecosystem projects (like Chihuahua, Juris Protocol, OmniFlix), technical tools and bridges (IBC, Terraport), validator and developer engagement, impact of external factors (Middle East conflict), and

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this chat message. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. The messages are from different users, mostly discussing Terra Classic (LUNC) and its community within the Cosmos ecosystem.

First, looking at the positive messages. There's a lot of enthusiasm about Terra Classic's recovery. For example, "I would be honored" and "TerraClassic is the ultimate decentralized community owned chain" show pride and optimism. Users mention joining Telegram groups, websites, and promoting their projects like HUAHUASwap entering testing phase. Phrases like "we have new opportunities to grow" and "together we are stronger" indicate positive sentiment. Also, greetings like "Good morning" and emojis like üöÄ, ü•∂ü´Çüßâüí°, and ‚úåÔ∏è are friendly and upbeat.

Now, the negative parts. Some messages express frustration. "I struggle with using Terraport on my phone. It glitches a lot" is a complaint. The mention of the Middle East conflict affecting crypto prices and the question "Is Luna Classic in Trouble?" might indicate concern. The phrase "We've been the cucks of cosmos for too long" uses a derogatory term, which is negative. Also, "Namada to Osmosis - is there ability to deposit? I'm getting error for 2 days" shows a problem someone is facing.

Neutral parts would be factual statements without clear positive or negative emotion. For example, "It will be one of Sunday or Saturday, more direct date will be soon" is just informing about a date. The links shared without commentary, like the Cosmos website or Twitter links, are neutral. Technical updates like "IBC Eureka. Connects us to the rest of the Cosmos" are also neutral.

I should check for sarcasm or hidden emotions. The "cucks" part is clearly negative, and the "blamefrag" hashtag seems to place responsibility on someone, which might be negative. However, some messages mix positive intent with frustration, like "We keep in building and we keep on pushing! We will not stop until we recover" ‚Äì this is determined, so positive despite the underlying struggle.

Putting it all together, the majority of messages are positive, focusing on community strength, recovery efforts, and new developments. There are some negative points about technical issues and external factors affecting crypto prices, but these are fewer. Neutral parts are the logistical and factual updates

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, and next steps from this text. So, the user provided a bunch of chat messages and wants me to parse through them to find any tasks, decisions made, or upcoming steps. 

First, I'll start by reading through each message one by one. The most recent messages are at the top here. The first one from cryptobytes906 says they'll reach out to teams and validators to ensure a variety of builders, validators, and community in attendance. That sounds like an action item. They're taking responsibility to contact others.

Then there's a message from "unknown" about the event being on Sunday or Saturday with a more direct date coming soon. That seems like a decision about the event date, but it's not confirmed yet. Maybe a next step is to finalize the date.

Another message from cryptobytes906 mentions bringing friends and arranging ambassadors once the date is known. Since the date is pending, this might be a next step once the date is confirmed. So maybe "Arrange ambassadors from around the chain once the event date is confirmed."

Looking further, there's an invitation to the Cosmos Voice podcast for cryptobytes906. The decision here is that they will be invited to share ideas. So that's an action item for the unknown person to send the invitation and for cryptobytes906 to prepare.

Then there's a message from sters6 encouraging others to try the IBC bridge on Terraport. That's a next step or action item for the community to test the bridge.

EternalBytes posted about HUAHUASwap entering testing phase. The action item here is to test the HUAHUASwap, and maybe the next step is to move to the next phase after testing.

RpPn2 is having an error depositing from Namada to Osmosis. The next step would be to troubleshoot or resolve that error.

SuperEra lists various components of OmniFlixNetwork, but I don't see an action item there unless it's promoting their services. Maybe not relevant here.

Doncho_MIOFF shared a blog post about LUNC's participation in the Berlin summit. That's a decision to represent LUNC at the summit, so the action item is to continue promoting or participating in such events.

Another message from Doncho_MIOFF mentions a blog post about Luna Classic's potential
