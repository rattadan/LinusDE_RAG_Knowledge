## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on decisions and main points.

Starting from the top: MissRose_bot reported Jay to admins. That's a moderation action, so note that. Then mpol38 talks about Bitcoin hitting an all-time high soon, which is a crypto market prediction. Iconoicono mentions the state of society and shares a link, but the link itself might not be key unless referenced again. 

Yolandi9 asks about ATONE compared to Atom, potential, and if it's investable. Then there's a discussion between yolandi9 and nicoIas_danyIove about ATONE's future, comparing it to Evmos, and whether it's a good investment. They mention staking, tokens (ATONE and PHOTON), and burning ATONE for PHOTON. Also, the idea of selling on time and becoming rich through airdrops. 

Sirwenalot comments on altcoins, not giving advice, but mentions ATONE's volatility and suggests checking the dev quality. AnubisPhy talks about creating liquidity pools on Osmosis for $ANUBI, asking the community to debate and offering tokens as a reward. 

Other messages include discussions about Cosmos chains, projects like Berachain not being a Cosmos chain, Jager airdrop, Union faucet, and some mentions of NFTs and DEX launches. There's also some moderation actions like muting a user for discussing politics.

I need to group related points. The main topics are: reporting a user, crypto market discussions (Bitcoin, L2 projects), ATONE/PHOTON project analysis and investment potential, AnubisPhy's liquidity pool decision, Cosmos ecosystem updates (SDK versions, new chains), airdrops and faucets, and moderation actions.

Decisions include AnubisPhy's community vote on liquidity pools, users considering investing in ATONE, and moderation actions taken. Also, the mention of SDK 0.50 and CW 2.0 updates for Juno.

I should avoid including every link unless it's crucial. Focus on the key decisions and opinions expressed. Also, note the skepticism towards some projects (Evmos, Loop) and the advice to do your own research.

Putting it all together concisely, highlighting the main points without

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring or significant themes.

Starting with the first entry, MissRose_bot reports a user, which might relate to moderation or community management. Then mpol38 talks about Bitcoin reaching an all-time high, so that's cryptocurrency and Bitcoin specifically. Next, iconoicono mentions "state of society," which is a broad topic but could be a theme here.

Looking at the links shared, like the Mad Pride Wikipedia page and discussions about it, that's a clear topic. There's also a lot of discussion around L2 projects and their failures, with mpol38 mentioning investments and losses. Terms like "Berachain," "Cosmos chain," and "ATOM" come up, indicating blockchain platforms and their ecosystems.

The conversation between yolandi9 and nicoIas_danyIove discusses ATONE as an alternative to ATOM, potential investments, and comparisons to Evmos. This ties into cryptocurrency investments and specific projects. Terms like "stake," "smart contracts," and "IBC" suggest topics related to blockchain technology features.

There's mention of airdrops, like the Jager Airdrop and Union Faucet, which are part of crypto marketing strategies. Other topics include NFTs on platforms like Intergaze and Juno, and discussions about liquidity pools on Osmosis. 

The text also includes some slang and community-specific terms like "rekt," "degen," and "mad pride," which might relate to community culture or specific movements within the crypto space. Political discussions are muted by the bot, indicating governance or moderation policies.

Additionally, there are references to projects like LoopChain, Stride, and Nomic, which could be specific blockchain projects. The mention of SDK updates (sdk 0.50, cw 2.0) points to technical developments. 

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be around cryptocurrency projects (Bitcoin, ATONE, ATOM), blockchain platforms (Cosmos, Juno, Osmosis), NFTs, airdrops, smart contracts, IBC, liquidity pools, community discussions (mad pride, societal state), moderation, and investment speculation. Also, there's some mention of specific events or campaigns like the AtlasDAO streaming event and the Kopi Claimdrop.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify any explicit tasks, decisions made, or future plans mentioned.

Starting with the first message from MissRose_bot, it reports Jay to admins. The action item here is the report itself, so I should note that Jay was reported. Then, looking at mpol38's message about Bitcoin reaching a new high, that's more of an opinion than an action item. 

Iconoicono shares a link and mentions "state of society" and some discussion about groups and hierarchy. Not sure if there's an action here. Then, imasalmon talks about Mad Pride and provides a Wikipedia link. The user asks what Mad Pride is, so maybe the next step is to look into that. 

AnubisPhy has a big decision about creating liquidity pools on Osmosis. They're asking the community to participate in a thread on X for a token reward. That's a clear decision point and a call to action for the community. 

MissRose_bot mutes MaestroLunatico for 5 minutes because of politics. The action here is the mute. 

VexxVakan mentions an upcoming update on mainnet in 2 hours 30 minutes, and they're working on SDK 0.50 and cw 2.0. So next steps include deploying that update.

SuperEra promotes an event with Atlasdao on StreamSwap_io, including a bonus campaign. Users need to deposit USDC and answer questions.

Other messages seem to be discussions, opinions, or links without specific actions. I should focus on the ones that have clear tasks or decisions. 

Need to make sure I don't miss any deadlines or specific tasks. Also, check for any community calls to action, like participating in threads or events. 

Putting it all together, the main points are the report of Jay, the decision to create liquidity pools on Osmosis for Anubis, the mute action by MissRose_bot, the upcoming Jun
