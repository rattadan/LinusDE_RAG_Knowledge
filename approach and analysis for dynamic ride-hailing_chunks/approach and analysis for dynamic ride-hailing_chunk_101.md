I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

Overlapping area calculations

The new shift 𝛥 in 𝑥 and 𝑦 direction after rotating the coordinate system
by 45◦ can be calculated based on the original shift 𝛥′ as follows:
√
2| ′ 2
2|
𝛥𝑥 =
(11)
|𝛥 𝑥 − 𝛥′ 𝑦 |
|
2 |
√
2| ′ 2
2|
𝛥𝑦 =
(12)
|𝛥 𝑥 + 𝛥′ 𝑦 |
|
2 |

To handle the supply and demand calculations precisely, the overlaps of different zones have to be calculated. The radius of a zone is
equivalent to the maximum waiting time 𝑇𝑊 of the requests, so that
all requests arising in a zone can be served by vehicles placed in the
parking lot in the center of the zone within the time limit. Similar
zones (with the same radius) can also be created around a vehicle or a
request. In case of a request-based zone, a vehicle would have to be
inside this zone to be able to reach this request in time. The shape
of these zones depends on the used distance metric. For Euclidean
distances, the zones form a circle with a radius of 𝑇𝑊 (in terms of
driving time).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Processes:**

1. The chunk describes an overlap calculation for different zones in a real-time management system.
2. It mentions various formulas to calculate the shifts `𝛥𝑥` and `𝛥𝑦`, which are used to determine the positions of vehicles in relation to requests (`𝛥′`). These calculations involve:
	* Rotating the coordinate system by 45°.
	* Calculating the differences between the original shift `𝛥′` and the new position `𝛥𝑥`.
	* Squaring these differences to ensure accurate results.
3. The chunk also mentions creating overlapping zones, which depend on the maximum waiting time `𝑇𝑊` of requests within a zone.

**Context Connection and Requirements:**

1. This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by discussing real-time management in ride-hailing systems, specifically dynamic dispatch and repositioning.
2. It also connects to previous discussions about simulation models (e.g., Bischoff & Maciejewski, Braverman et al.) and dynamic dispatch approaches (e.g., Geng et al., Jiao et al.). The chunk provides specific technical details on overlap calculations, which are essential for real-time management in these systems.
3. It requires an understanding of the system's parameters, such as waiting times `𝑇𝑊`, and distance metrics like Euclidean distances.

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

1. None mentioned explicitly, but implied requirements include:
	* Accurate overlap calculations to determine vehicle positions relative to requests.
	* Real-time management in ride-hailing systems.
	* Use of simulation models and dynamic dispatch approaches.
2. Constraints may include:
	* Limited computational resources or processing power.
	* Complexity of the system's parameters (e.g., waiting times, distance metrics).
	* Real-world data and noise may impact performance.
