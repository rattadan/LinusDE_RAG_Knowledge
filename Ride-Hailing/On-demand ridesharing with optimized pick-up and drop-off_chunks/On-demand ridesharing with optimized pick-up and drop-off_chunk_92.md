**Original Text:**

As the problem becomes much more complex, we proposed some heuristics that allow solving the problem. After showing that the heuristics are indeed helpful by applying them over a toy network, we applied this method over the real
dataset of trips that took place by taxi during one representative hour in Manhattan, and compared the results with and without
walking. We showed that short average walks improve the global figures of the system meaningfully, reducing mostly the number of
rejections and VHT. We analyzed how results distribute in space, to conclude that passengers whose origins or destinations are located
in the most demanded zones tend to have worse quality of service in general; in particular, they are more likely to be requested to walk. Sensitivity analyses over the toy network show that the improvements induced by walking are robust to changes in the most relevant
numeric parameters, the demand structure or the network. There are several relevant avenues to pursue future research.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is explaining how a proposed heuristic approach for solving ridesharing problem instances was successfully applied on a real dataset of trips from Manhattan taxi data.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* The problem involves finding an optimal solution to the ridesharing problem, which typically has exponential complexity.
* Heuristics were used as a shortcut to solve the problem efficiently without explicitly trying all possible combinations or exhaustive search methods.
* A toy network was used to test and validate the effectiveness of the heuristics before applying them on real-world data.

**Connection to Surrounding Context:**

* The text builds upon the existing reference list, which provides context on various aspects of ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems.
* The proposed heuristic approach is presented as a new methodology for solving complex problems in this field.
* The use of real datasets and sensitivity analyses demonstrates the practical application of the heuristics.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

* A significant amount of computational power (i.e., time and resources) was required to run simulations on large datasets.
* Data preparation, such as cleaning and preprocessing, involved complex analysis of trip data.
* The heuristic approach assumes some level of familiarity with mathematical modeling, optimization techniques, and simulation methods.
