## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I'll go through each message to understand the context.

Starting from the latest messages. The osmosis_statbot mentions visiting the support site. Then xTr3ndy shares a link to Backbone Labs' NFT collections on Osmosis. Griffin_web3 shares a link to Margined.io's Discord and documentation. User_319582897 is asking about retrieving OSMO tokens from an app, which seems like a concern about staking or depositing funds. Griffin_web3 asks which app, and user_319582897 is referring to Margined.io's vaults. CR202020 is looking for their MAD SCIENTIST NFT, not seeing it in assets, and someone tells them to connect their wallet. Underworldnfts asks about joining raffles and prizes. There's some discussion about a Discord link and respecting female scientists. Osmosis_news shares a Twitter link. WhoIsAbk talks about a mascot and hashes. Money_Printer888 explains staking and yield farming. MRHULK30 asks about buy/sell orders on Osmosis.

Key points: Support site link, NFT links from Backbone Labs, Margined.io's Discord and documentation, user concerns about retrieving OSMO from Margined.io, CR202020's NFT visibility issue, guidance to connect wallet, Underworldnfts raffle inquiries, discussion on staking/yield farming, and MRHULK30's question about trading features.

Decisions: Users are seeking support and information on where to find their NFTs, directed to connect wallets or visit support sites. There's a mention of passive income through staking and yield farming, but with risks. Also, some links to external platforms like Margined.io and Backbone Labs are shared.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without too much detail. Maybe group similar topics: support resources, NFT-related queries, staking/yield farming explanation, and trading features. Also note the user concerns about retrieving funds and asset visibility. Avoid including every link but mention the platforms involved. Highlight the key questions and the advice given.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each line of the text and identify the key themes or topics mentioned.

Starting with the first line, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. So, "official support site" and "Osmosis" are probably topics here. Then xTr3ndy shares a link related to NFTs on Backbone Labs, so "NFT collections" and "Backbone Labs" come up. 

Next, griffin_web3 mentions a Discord invite link, so "Discord community" is a topic. There's a user asking if anyone has worked with an app, which points to "user experience with app" or "app inquiry." Another link from griffin_web3 to Margined.io's documentation suggests "vaults" or "DeFi services" might be relevant. 

The user_319582897 is asking about putting OSMO in a vault and retrieving it, so that's "OSMO staking process" and "vault retrieval." CR202020 can't find their MAD SCIENTIST NFT, so "NFT storage" and "MAD SCIENTIST NFT" are topics. Underworldnfts talks about raffles and prizes, leading to "Underworld raffles" and "special prize." 

There's a mention of Stargaze and connecting wallets, so "Stargaze platform" and "wallet connection" come up. Discussions about a Discord server and Margined.io links relate to "Discord community" again and "DeFi platforms." 

WhoIsAbk brings up respecting female scientists and a mascot for Osmosis, so "female scientists" and "Osmosis mascot" are topics. The Osmosis news link is straightforward as "Osmosis news." 

Other messages include crypto hashes, which might relate to "crypto hashing," and a hashtag #superfuntime. There's also a mention of staking and yield farming with potential earnings, so "staking," "yield farming," and "passive income crypto." 

MRHULK30 asks about buy/sell orders on Osmosis, so "buy/sell order options" is another topic. I should also note the specific platforms and services mentioned like "Marg

## üòä Sentiment Analysis

Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from Osmosis and wants to know the overall sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with the latest messages at the top. The first message is from osmosis_statbot providing a support link. That's neutral, just offering help. Then xTr3ndy shares a link to an NFT collection, which seems positive as they're promoting something. Griffin_web3 mentions a Discord link, which is informative, so neutral. User_319582897 asks if anyone has worked with the app, which is a question seeking assistance‚Äîneutral. Another message from griffin_web3 with a link to learn more, again neutral. Then user_319582897 shares a link to a trading platform, maybe positive if they're excited about it.

Looking at the earlier messages: griffin_web3 asks what app, user_319582897 inquires about putting OSMO and retrieving it, which is a question about process‚Äîneutral. CR2020200 asks for a link, showing they can't remember, maybe slightly negative but more neutral.

CR2020200 has trouble finding an NFT, which is a bit negative but more of a problem report. Griffin_web3 provides a link to a minting site, neutral. 

Then there's WhoIsAbk discussing respecting female scientists, which is positive. Another message from them about a mascot with sex appeal, which is a suggestion but maybe a bit negative if they're criticizing the current mascot. Osmosis_news shares a Twitter link, neutral. WhoIsAbk's message about hashes not doing anything shows frustration, so negative. Another hashtag from them, neutral. CR2020200 asks someone to check DMs, neutral.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I'll read through each message to understand the context.

Starting with the user_319582897 asking about putting OSMO into an app and retrieving it. They want to know what happens and the process. Then they ask someone to explain, so maybe the next steps involve someone providing an explanation or them checking a link. 

Griffin_web3 mentions a Discord link and docs for margined.io. That could be an action item to join the Discord or read the docs. The user_319582897 also shared a link to trade.margined.io/osmosis/vaults. So maybe visiting that link is a next step.

CR202020 bought an NFT but can't find it. They mention connecting a wallet and checking the dashboard, so the action item here might be connecting the wallet or checking the dashboard. Also, they asked under what category it would be, so maybe looking into categories like "ASSETS" or "LAB".

There's a mention of a special prize by Underworldnfts and a question about when MM joins raffles. That might be a decision to offer a prize or a next step to coordinate with MM for raffles.

WhoIsAbk talks about respecting female scientists and a mascot idea. The mascot part might be a decision to create one, but it's more of a suggestion. The hashtag #superfuntime could be a campaign or event name.

Money_Printer888 explains staking and yield farming, which might be educational but not an action item unless someone decides to act on it. 

MRHULK30 asks if Osmosis has buy/sell options, which could prompt someone to check the platform or provide an answer.

I need to list each action item, decision, or next step clearly. Make sure to note who is responsible if mentioned. Also, include links provided as part of the next steps. Avoid including questions unless they imply a required action from someone else. 

So, compiling all these points, the action items would be:

1. User_319582897 needs an explanation about the app's process for OSMO deposit and retrieval. So the next step is someone explaining or them checking the provided links.

2. CR2020
