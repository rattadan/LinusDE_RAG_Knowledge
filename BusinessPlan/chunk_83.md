## Chunk 83

**Original Text:**

Battery life: nRide is heavy on networking which puts strain
on the device’s battery (cellular or wifi). This is a factor that
could undermine the user-experience

There are low hanging fruits we can implement such as a
better encoding scheme, and more advanced retry logic to
reduce this risk if it becomes an issue

NFC handshake:The only part in the roadmap where we are
still not sure that a solution is feasible is the one concerning
the NFC handshake whereby users exchange secrets to
unlock escrow funds by tapping phones. There is a risk that
we find out that this isn’t feasible. If this is the case, we can implement other ways to exchange
secrets, like by the click of a button, even if this might result
in a slightly worse user experience. In any case, it doesn’t
undermine the overall solution

Managerial Risks
Description

Mitigation

Timeline slippage: The project is composed of a few
workstreams (core, smart-contracts, UX) which need to be
coordinated carefully so as to be ready for integration and
testing towards month 10, leaving enough time at the end to
address the inevitable unforeseen issues.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that there are several risks associated with the NFC handshake feature in the nRide project. Here's a breakdown of each risk and potential mitigation strategies:

1. **Battery life strain on cellular or WiFi connectivity**: Implementing better encoding schemes and more advanced retry logic can help reduce this risk.
   - Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that these changes don't negatively impact battery life.

2. **Feasibility risks associated with the NFC handshake**: The project team might need to consider alternative methods for exchanging secrets, which could result in a slightly worse user experience. 
   - Mitigation:
     - Conduct feasibility studies and surveys among potential users to gauge interest and gather feedback.
     - Consider implementing a "click-to-exchange" mechanism as an alternative.

3. **Project timeline slippage**: To manage the project's schedule, prioritize task coordination among workstreams (core, smart-contracts, UX).
   - Mitigation:
     - Establish clear communication channels between team members and stakeholders to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
     - Set realistic milestones and deadlines for each workstream, taking into account potential setbacks or unforeseen issues.

By acknowledging these risks and implementing mitigation strategies, the nRide project can minimize its vulnerabilities and deliver a successful product.
