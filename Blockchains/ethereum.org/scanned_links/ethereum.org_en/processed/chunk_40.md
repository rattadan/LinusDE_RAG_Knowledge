## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
This content provides detailed technical information about the Beacon Chain, including block metadata, validator statistics, attestations, and related blockchain parameters such as slots, epochs, and validator statuses.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Attestations**: Votes for a block that ensure its validity, with parameters like aggregation bits and committee indices.  
- **Validators**: Participants in the Beacon Chain, tracking deposits, exits, balances, and status.  
- **Slots**: Time units in which blocks are proposed, linked to epochs.  
- **Epochs**: Periods of time in which blocks are validated, with transitions between justified and unverified states.  
- **Proposer**: The validator algorithmically chosen to create a block.  
- **Slashings**: Penalties imposed on proposers for incorrect blocks.  
- **Beacon Block Root**: The root of the block being attested to.  
- **Effective Balance**: Validator’s balance used for staking, excluding rewards.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Attestation Effectiveness**: Metrics like the average time for attestations to be included in the chain (e.g., "120 seconds").  
- **Validator Status**: Parameters like "Current balance" and "Effective balance" include rewards, penalties, and staking status.  
- **Committee Index**: The index of the validator’s committee at a specific slot, critical for aggregation.  
- **Aggregation Bits**: Binary data used to combine attestations from multiple validators.  
- **Epoch Boundaries**: The "Source" and "Target" pointers to the latest justified epoch and epoch boundary.  
- **Slot-Related Parameters**: Slots, epochs, and proposer selection (e.g., "Proposer: Alice, Slot: 12345, Epoch: 12").  

### Related Topics  
- **Beacon Chain Architecture**: Connections to sections about validator participation, block validation, and consensus mechanisms.  
- **Validator Status**: Links to details about validator eligibility, active since dates, and slashing penalties.  
- **Attestation Mechanisms**: References to how attestations are aggregated and validated in the Beacon Chain.  
- **Block Proposals**: Connections to validator-proposed blocks and their validation processes.

Number of attestations for the block in this slot
- Deposits - The number of deposits during this slot
- Voluntary exits - The number of validators that left during the slot
- Slashings - Number of penalties given to proposers of blocks or attestors
- Votes - The validators that voted for the block in this slot
- Proposer - The validator that was algorithmically chosen to propose the new block
- Epoch - The epoch in which the block was proposed
- Slot - The slot in which the block was proposed
- Attestations - The number of attestation included in the slotattestations are like votes that indicate the block is ready to go to the Beacon Chain
- Validator number - Unique number that represents the validator
- Current balance - The validator's balance including rewards
- Effective balance - The validator's balance that is used for staking
- Income - The rewards or penalties received by the validator
- Status - Whether the validator is currently online and active or not
- Attestation effectiveness - The average time it takes for the validator's attestations to be included in the chain
- Eligibility for activation - Date (and epoch) when the validator became available to validate
- Active since - Date (and epoch) when the validator became active
- Proposed blocks - The block that the validator has proposed
- Attestations - The attestations that the validator has provided
- Deposits - The from address, transaction hash, block number, timestamp, amount and status of the staking deposit made by the validator
- Slot - The slot in which the attestation took place
- Committee index - The index of the committee at the given slot
- Aggregation bits - Represents the aggregated attestation of all participating validators in the attestation
- Validators - The validators that provided attestations
- Beacon block root - Points to the block to which validators are attesting
- Source - Points to the latest justified epoch
- Target - Points to the latest epoch boundary
- Current epoch
