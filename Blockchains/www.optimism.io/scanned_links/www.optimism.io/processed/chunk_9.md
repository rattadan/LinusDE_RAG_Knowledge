### Document Overview  
This content outlines the Optimism Collective's vision for a decentralized, equitable internet through blockchain governance and Retro Funding, while detailing the legal framework of the Optimism Community Agreement.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Blockchains and modular, open-source codebases to ensure no single entity controls the internet.  
- **Retro Funding**: A mechanism to reward public goods (e.g., infrastructure, governance) with profit to participants.  
- **Impact=Profit Principle**: Governance model where positive contributions to the Collective are rewarded to individuals.  
- **OP Stack**: Modular, open-source blockchain framework for global scale.  
- **Decentralized Governance**: Collective decision-making via communities, companies, and citizens.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Retro Funding**: A system where participants earn rewards for contributing to public goods (e.g., node operations, security).  
- **OP Mainnet**: A public blockchain platform for decentralized computing.  
- **OP Stack**: A modular, open-source codebase for building interconnected blockchains.  
- **Governance Model**: Decentralized decision-making via communities and stakeholders.  
- **Blockchains**: Critical for infrastructure, but require a platform to achieve global scale.  

### Related Topics  
- **"Join the Collective" section**: Aligns with the Community Agreement’s goals of equitable internet governance.  
- **"Optimism Community Agreement"**: Details legal terms (e.g., OP Mainnet, OP Stack, and the Optimism Foundation).  
- **Decentralized Governance**: Connected to the Collective’s principles in the "Join the Collective" section.

h3: Join the Collective

The traditional web has inherited exploitative economic rulesets that limit power and influence in the hands of the few. The Optimism Collective aims to create a new internet that benefits all and is owned by all.

This internet will be sustained by rewarding public goods through Retro Funding.

The Optimism Collective is a new model of digital democratic governance. It is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by the axiom of impact=profit the principle that positive impact to the Collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.

Put simply, were forking capitalism.

A secure, equitable, and fair internet can only exist if it is built on decentralized infrastructure. Blockchains are the key, but they need a platform for global scale.

The foundation for a more equitable digital economy is an interconnected network of blockchains built on a modular, open-source codebase.

This system will distribute power more evenly across the Superchain, ensuring that no one can own the internet. Empowering values. Robust infrastructure. An economy where everyone thrives.
