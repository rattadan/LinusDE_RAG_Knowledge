Putting these tweets in context:
These retweets suggest that the author (or the person managing this account) is interested in positioning themselves as someone who understands the realities of entrepreneurship and global business building.

Now let me generate some keywords/tags:

1. Entrepreneurship
2. Global business
3. Startup challenges
4. Venture capital
5. Networking events

These tags reflect the themes I've identified in the tweets, focusing on entrepreneurship, the difficulty of building successful ventures, global business considerations, and networking opportunities.

I should note that since both tweets are retweets rather than original content, my analysis is somewhat limited. I'm analyzing the content being shared rather than original posts, which gives me less insight into the person's specific intentions or character beyond what can be inferred from their choice of retweets.
