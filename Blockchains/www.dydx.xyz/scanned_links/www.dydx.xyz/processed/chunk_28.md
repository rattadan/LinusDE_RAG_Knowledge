### Document Overview  
The content discusses Bitcoin and Ethereum's consensus mechanisms (PoW and PoS), their environmental impacts, and key technical features like the halving event, staking, and carbon emissions.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Energy-intensive consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions.  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Energy-efficient alternative to PoW, used by Ethereum, where validators lock assets to confirm transactions and earn rewards.  
- **Halving**: Periodic reduction of Bitcoin rewards (every 4 years) to control supply and maintain scarcity.  
- **Staking**: Process of locking assets (e.g., ETH) to validate transactions and earn rewards, with PoS systems randomly selecting validators.  
- **Carbon Emissions**: Bitcoin’s PoW system produces 4.8 million tons of CO₂ annually, while Ethereum’s PoS transition reduced emissions by 99.95%.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Ethereum’s PoS Transition**: Requires staking at least 32 ETH to process transactions, with validators earning rewards for batched transactions.  
- **Bitcoin’s PoW**: Miners use renewable energy (59.5%) but still face environmental concerns due to high energy consumption.  
- **Carbon Emissions Metrics**: Bitcoin’s annual CO₂ emissions: 4.8 million tons (2022), Ethereum’s: 870 tons (2022) post-PoS.  
- **Halving Mechanism**: Bitcoin’s supply decreases by 50% every 4 years, aiming for a 0% inflation rate by 2140.  

### Related Topics  
- **Environmental Impact**: The document connects Bitcoin’s PoW to its high energy consumption and Ethereum’s PoS transition to reduced emissions.  
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Highlights the contrast between PoW (Bitcoin) and PoS (Ethereum) as technical features.  
- **Blockchain Sustainability**: Notes the trade-off between scalability, energy efficiency, and long-term scarcity management.

real-world payment network. Bitcoin supporters believe BTC is a viable alternative to fiat currencies and a potential global reserve currency. While itâs possible to build dApps on top of Bitcoin, Nakamotoâs goal was to use blockchain technology to create a new version of digital cash.Â

Between 2015 and 2022, Ethereum and Bitcoin used the same PoW consensus algorithm to confirm transactions. In both systems, âminersâ used computing power to solve puzzles, validate blocks of transactions, and earn cryptocurrency rewards.

But in September of 2022, the Ethereum blockchain switched to a PoS system. Now, anyone who wants to process transactions on Ethereum has to lock at least 32 ETH on the blockchain. A PoS algorithm randomly chooses one âstakerâ to confirm new transactions every few minutes, and ETH validators receive cryptocurrency rewards every time they verify a new batch of transfers.

PoW mining is an energy-intensive process. Despite recent reports that Bitcoinâs miners use59.5% renewables, BTC has a noticeable environmental impact. Researchers at Cambridge University suggest the Bitcoin blockchain currently pollutes over4.8 million tons of carbon dioxideyearly and produced200 million tonsof carbon dioxide between 2009 and 2022.

When Ethereum was a PoW chain, it was one of the dirtiest cryptocurrencies. However, since transitioning to PoS, the Ethereum Foundation cut its electricity and pollution rates by99.95%, and the blockchain dropped its carbon dioxide emissions from11 million to 870 tons annually.Â Â

Bitcoin has the most predictable issuance schedule in cryptocurrency. To maintain scarcity, the number of Bitcoins that enter circulation drops by half every four years in an event called âthe halvening.â This pre-set reward reduction continues until there are 21 million BTC in circulation, and the goal is for Bitcoin to have a 0% inflation rate by the year 2140.
