**Original Text:**

(2004), which ranged from 10 s to
20 s. In contrast, Engelhardt et al. (2019) investigated efficiency gains of a ridepooling service depending on the adoption rate of private vehicles and employed a boarding time
of 60 s for each passenger pick-up in their simulation for Munich, while analogue information about the time scale for the drop-off is missing. Similarly, two further studies (HÃ¶rl and
Zwick 2021; Lorig, Persson, and Michielsen 2023) used a default value of 60 s for the stop
time parameter in their simulations, encompassing boarding and alighting processes. The
work done by Bischoff, Maciejewski, and Nagel (2017) assumed a stop time of 60 s for PUDO
events while investigating a shared taxi system in Berlin. Salman et al. (2023) referred to this
Berlin study when determining an appropriate stop time for their simulation of a ridepooling service in Birmingham, with the aim of assessing the operational impacts.
