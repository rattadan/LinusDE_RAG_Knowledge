## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different users on Osmosis, so I need to parse through each message and identify the main topics.

First, there's a mention of a support site from osmosis_statbot. Then, kychuli and others are discussing a user with a stuck transaction, directing them to open a support ticket. That's an immediate action point.

Next, there's a lot of talk about OSMO tokenomics. User_343756695 mentions that emissions are dropping by 1/3 soon, and that the token could become net deflationary in the future due to burning mechanisms. Fardinss86 asks about supply cap, and user_343756695 confirms a max cap of 1B OSMO, with projections of 500M in circulation after 10 years. So key points here are emissions reduction, deflationary goals, and supply cap.

Then, there's a discussion about Polaris, which seems to be a product related to Osmosis. Davidjgoosey mentions that Polaris isn't generating revenue yet, so discussions about revenue sharing or buybacks are premature. The team is focusing on product quality before monetization. Also, there's a mention of swap success rates being important for beta launch, but full launch depends on other factors. Norrisherr and others talk about future features like revenue sharing, privacy vaults, mobile version, and hard wallet support. So key points here are Polaris's beta status, upcoming features, and future monetization plans.

Another part is about block explorers and data availability. User_857217097 is having trouble finding holder info and activities on MintScan and other explorers. Kychuli and others suggest alternative tools like Pulsar, Chainscope, and Celatone. So the issue here is the need for better data tools and the current limitations.

There's also a mention of a user asking if Sunny Aggarwal is still involved, but it's unclear if he's active. That's a point about team involvement.

Lastly, some users express bullish sentiment on OSMO's future price, with predictions of $70 in 10 years. That's a speculative point

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring or significant themes. The text includes multiple conversations about Osmosis, Polaris, $OSMO token, and related topics. 

Looking at the messages from kychuli and others, there's a lot of discussion about block explorers and tools for checking wallet info, like Mintscan, Chainscope, and Pulsar Finance. That seems like one main topic: tools and explorers for Osmosis.

Then there's a big focus on tokenomics. Users mention emissions dropping by 1/3, the max supply of 1B OSMO, burning tokens leading to deflationary effects, and future revenue sharing. These points all relate to the $OSMO token's supply and economic model.

Polaris comes up frequently. Topics include its beta status, mobile version development, integration across chains, privacy features, and how it might affect the $OSMO price. So Polaris updates and features are another main topic.

Transaction issues are mentioned too. Aragorn953 has a stuck transaction, and others talk about swap success rates and support processes. That's a separate topic related to user support and technical problems.

User support is also highlighted with the Statbot directing users to the support site, and users discussing opening tickets or needing help tracking activities and holders. So support resources and assistance is a topic.

There's some discussion about price predictions and market cap, like $OSMO reaching $70 in 10 years and comparisons to Solana's market cap. That's speculative and market-related.

Lastly, there's a mention of Nansen integration and the lack of data availability for Cosmos compared to EVM block explorers. This ties into data accessibility and third-party tools.

Putting it all together, the main topics are: Osmosis support resources, OSMO tokenomics (emissions, supply cap, deflation), Polaris updates (beta, mobile, features), transaction issues, price predictions, and data accessibility. I should list these concisely, ensuring each is distinct and covers all related messages.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through the messages carefully. The text is a series of chat messages from different users, mostly discussing Osmosis (OSMO) and Polaris. 

First, I'll go through each message and note the sentiment. The user 'osmosis_statbot' sends a message about visiting the support site, which seems neutral. Then 'kychuli' says "got your dm that works üëå" which is positive with the checkmark emoji. Another bot message from 'osmosis_statbot' again is neutral. 

Next, 'kychuli' tells someone to open a ticket, which is a helpful action but maybe neutral in sentiment. Then 'Aragorn953' mentions a stuck transaction and asks for help, which is negative. 'davidjgoosey' offers assistance, so that's positive. 

Looking at the conversation between 'user_343756695' and 'Fardinss86', they discuss token supply and emissions. 'user_343756695' is positive about OSMO's future price and deflationary aspects, while 'Fardinss86' asks questions but also says "That's good" which is positive. 

There's a mention of someone buying OSMO at $7 and another user responding with positive emojis like üòÅüí™üèª, indicating positive sentiment. Discussions about Polaris and its potential benefits for OSMO holders are also positive. 

However, there are some negative parts too. 'user_857217097' has several messages about issues with finding holder info and block explorers not working, which are negative. They mention errors and frustration, which contributes to a negative tone. 

Other messages talk about the future of Polaris, swap success rates, and revenue sharing, which are neutral or positive. The user 'norrisherr' has a mix of questions and positive statements like "polaris is the GOAT," which is positive slang. 

I need to balance these. The positive sentiments come from users excited about the project's future, potential deflationary effects, and helpful responses. The negative parts are from users facing technical issues with the tools and seeking support. 

Overall, the conversation seems to have more positive and neutral messages, with some negative ones due to technical

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people, and I need to go through each one to see if there's anything that needs to be done, a decision made, or a next step mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's just a link, so maybe not an action item but a resource. Then kychuli says "got your dm that works üëå" ‚Äì that seems like a confirmation, not an action. Another statbot message repeats the support link.

Next, kychuli tells someone to "open a ticket ill dig in #support". So opening a ticket is an action item here. The user Aragorn953 says their transaction is stuck and asks for help. Davidjgoosey mentions that kychuli can help, and then tells Aragorn953 to share here. So maybe the next step is for Aragorn953 to share details in the channel.

Looking further down, there's a discussion about emissions dropping by 1/3 in a few days. That's a decision that's already been made, so maybe note that the emissions reduction is scheduled. Then there's talk about making the token net deflationary, which is a goal but not an immediate action.

Another part is user_857217097 complaining about Mintscan not working and needing info on holders and activities. Kychuli and others provide alternative explorers like pulsar.finance, chainscope, and celatone. So the next steps here might be for the user to check those links, and maybe the team needs to address Mintscan issues or consider integrating Nansen, as the user requested cooperation with Nansen. But since the team says Nansen integration is unlikely, perhaps that's a decision made.

There's a mention of Polaris being in beta and needing a 95% swap success rate to exit beta. So the next step for the team is to work on improving swap success rates. Also, davidjgoosey says they have clips from a Twitter space to share next week, which is a next step.

Fardinss86 asks if Sunny Aggarwal is still around, but no direct action there. Yusungsang shares a link, which
