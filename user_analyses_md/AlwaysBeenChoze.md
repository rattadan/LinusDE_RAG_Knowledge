The user seems to be sharing insights and recommendations, which suggests a professional but passionate tone.

For legitimacy, the account is promoting several DeFi projects, which is common in the crypto space. However, the user is retweeting others and discussing various projects, which could be genuine interest or a way to promote their own projects. The mentions of specific projects and the detailed analysis might indicate credibility, but it's also possible that they're just sharing information without personal stake.
