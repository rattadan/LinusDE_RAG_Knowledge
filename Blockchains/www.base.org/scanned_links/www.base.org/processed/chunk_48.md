### Document Overview  
This document explains Basenames as a core onchain identity system on the Base blockchain, enabling users to register human-readable names for their wallet addresses, facilitating seamless transactions and collaboration.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Onchain Identity**: Basenames are decentralized, programmable identifiers for wallet addresses.  
- **ENS Compatibility**: Built on the same technology as ENS names, enabling cross-chain usability.  
- **Registration Fees**: Priced by name length, with discounts for free names (5+ letters) and BNS owner discounts.  
- **Discounts**: Limited to one per address, with conditions for free names (e.g., 0.001 ETH discount for shorter names or extended registrations).  
- **Global Accessibility**: Names are publicly accessible and usable across EVM chains.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Fee Structure**: Prices increase with name length, with free names (5+ letters) available for one year under specific criteria (e.g., equivalent-value discounts, extended registrations).  
- **Discount Rules**: Discounts apply once per address, with exceptions for BNS name owners (0.01 ETH per unique address).  
- **Technical Features**: Names are stored on Base, support multi-address registration, and integrate with onchain apps for seamless transactions.  

### Related Topics  
- **FAQ**: The document links to the FAQ for further troubleshooting.  
- **Developer Docs**: References to developer resources for building with Basenames.  
- **Base Ecosystem**: Connects to broader Base blockchain features (e.g., ENS, cross-chain compatibility).

Basenames are a core onchain building block that enable builders to establish their identity on Base by registering human-readable names for their wallet address(es). They are fully onchain, built on the same technology powering ENS names, and deployed on Base. These human-readable names can be used when connecting to onchain apps, and sending and receiving on Base and any other EVM chain.

Basenames are priced based on name length, and are designed to be globally accessible. Annual registration fees are as follows:

You can get one free Basename (5+ letters) for one year if you meet any of the below criteria:

An equivalent-value discount of 0.001 ETH will be applied if registering a shorter name, or registering for more than 1 year, with the exception of the BNS name owner discount (valued at 0.01 ETH per unique address). You will need to pay the standard registration fees if you wish to keep your Basename after your initial discount has been fully applied.

Discounts are only applied once, and are limited to one per address. Even if you meet multiple criteria, you will only be eligible for a single discount on one Basename.
