I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

To that end,
the costs 𝑐𝑖𝑗 of the matching (𝑖, 𝑗) are set to the negative reward
𝑟𝑖 of request 𝑖 plus the costs for the driving distance of vehicle
𝑗 to reach the respective pickup location 𝑝𝑖 . Please note that the
objective function of the matching problem is always the sum of
the costs of all selected matches. • Assignment interval 𝛿𝑀 : Depending on the setting, the assignment interval 𝛿𝑀 will have a significant impact on the strategy’s
quality. Generally, longer intervals will lead to more possible
combinations and, therefore, a more efficient solution. However,
longer intervals also increase the notification time as well as
the waiting time of the customers. When vehicles are already
done serving the previous request, they will wait until the next
matching happens instead of using this time to already travel to
the pickup location. Therefore, the benefit of longer matching
intervals in terms of travel time reduction per request has to be
larger than the increase in time between two matching epochs.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

1. **Objective Function:** The objective function of the matching problem is a sum of the costs of all selected matches.
2. **Costs:** Costs are represented as `𝑐𝑖𝑗`, which implies that there are two possible values for each match (`i` and `j`). However, the context suggests that these costs might be numeric values (e.g., dollars or cents).
3. **Driving Distance:** The driving distance from vehicle to pickup location is also represented as a cost.
4. **Reward Function:** The objective function has a negative reward component for request `𝑖` and positive costs for the driving distance to reach the pickup location (`𝑝𝑖`).

**Connection to Surrounding Context:**

This chunk appears to be discussing dynamic dispatch and repositioning strategies in ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on the objective function of a matching problem. The context suggests that this is related to:

1. **Real-time management:** The discussion touches upon real-time management, which implies that the system needs to adapt to changing demand or passenger preferences.
2. **Simulation and modeling:** The references mentioned earlier are likely simulation-based approaches used for modeling ride-hailing systems.

**Requirements, Conditions, and Constraints:**

The constraints mentioned in this chunk include:

1. **Objective Function:** The objective function should be optimized to minimize travel time reduction per request.
2. **Assignment Interval:** The assignment interval has a significant impact on the strategy's quality.
3. **Time Trade-off:** There is a trade-off between waiting times and notification times when vehicles wait for previous requests.

Overall, this chunk provides technical details about the objective function of dynamic dispatch strategies in ride-hailing systems, including cost structures and the importance of time trade-offs.
