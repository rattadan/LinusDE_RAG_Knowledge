**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

Note: you will see the voting power update in real-time based on the Lock-up period and the amount of ATOM you input. Click “Get Voting Power”. *NOTE: There are many reasons to choose your validator carefully in Cosmos. In the Hydro context, if your validator falls out of the active set, you will not receive staking rewards and will not be able to vote in Hydro anymore. ## Voting Power
------------

When you lock your LSM shares into Hydro, you gain voting power, which enables you to vote on liquidity distribution proposals. The amount of voting power you receive depends on two factors:

Amount of LSM shares locked Duration of lock-up (1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months)

The longer the lock-up period, the more voting power you will receive. However, voting power diminishes over time as the lock-up period gets closer to expiration. The specific calculation of your voting power is based on the remaining lockup duration at the end of the current round.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Here is a pragmatic analysis of the given text chunk and its context:

1. **Technical details**: 
   - The text chunk explains how voting power is calculated for users on the Hydro platform.
   - The voting power calculation is based on two factors: 
     a. Amount of Liquid Staking Module (LSM) shares locked.
     b. Duration of lock-up (1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months).
   
   - The longer the lock-up period, the more voting power a user will gain.
   - The voting power diminishes as the lock-up period gets closer to expiration.
   - The specific calculation of voting power is based on the remaining lockup duration at the end of the current round.

2. **Connection to the surrounding context**:
   - The text chunk relates to the "Lockups and Voting Power" section in the provided document.
   - The text chunk describes in detail the voting power calculation process which is outlined briefly in the previous section.
   - The provided context explains how users can gain voting power by locking their LSM shares, which is closely related to this text chunk.

3. **Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned**:
   - Users must lock their LSM shares to gain voting power.
   - The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lock-up.
   - Voting power diminishes as the lock-up period gets closer to expiration.
   - The specific calculation of voting power is based on the remaining lockup duration at the end of the current round.

However, it is noted that there might be missing information regarding the specific mathematical formula or ratio for calculating voting power in relation to the lock-up duration and the amount of LSM shares locked. Further analysis through the documentation is recommended for complete understanding.
