I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

This happens due to matching constraints like maximum waiting time. Under some specific assumptions

Ideally, all zones are perfectly balanced (𝑏𝑘 = 0, ∀𝑘 ∈ ). In case of
unbalanced zones, vehicles should be shifted between zones to reduce
the imbalances. Positive values of 𝑏𝑘 indicate a surplus of supply while
negative values indicate a shortage of supply. The authors propose an
iterative procedure, starting with the most unbalanced zone (largest
|𝑏𝑘 |), which pulls one vehicle from a neighboring zone (if 𝑏𝑘 < 0) or
pushes one vehicle to a neighboring zone (if 𝑏𝑘 > 0). Which neighboring
zone 𝑙 ∈ 𝑁(𝑘) is selected depends on their respective balances. If the
neighboring zone should provide a vehicle, the zone with the largest
𝑏𝑙 is selected, while for accepting an additional vehicle, the zone with
the smallest 𝑏𝑙 is chosen. The iterative procedure stops when all zone
balances are within a certain threshold (|𝑏𝑘 | ≤ 𝛽, ∀𝑘 ∈ ).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the provided text chunk, here's an analysis of its technical details, parameters, processes, and connections to the surrounding context:

**Technical Details:**

* The process involves balancing zones in a ride-hailing system by shifting vehicles between them.
* The balancing metric is the imbalance factor `𝑏𝑘`, which indicates whether there's a surplus or shortage of supply in each zone.
* The proposed iterative procedure aims to reduce imbalances by pulling or pushing vehicles between neighboring zones.

**Parameters and Processes:**

* The threshold for stopping the iteration is `|𝑏𝑘 | ≤ 𝛽` (a value not specified, but presumably a bound on the imbalance factor).
* The process involves selecting a neighboring zone based on its balance (`𝑙 ∈ 𝑁(𝑘)`), with the goal of reducing imbalances by either pulling a vehicle from a less-balanced zone or pushing one to a more balanced zone.

**Connections and Requirements:**

* The process is designed to address unbalanced zones in the system, where there's an excess of supply (`𝑏𝑘 > 0`) or a shortage of supply (`𝑏𝑘 < 0`).
* The threshold value `𝛽` suggests that the iteration should stop when all zone balances are within a certain limit.
* The process assumes that zones can be neighboring each other, implying a spatial arrangement of vehicles and zones.

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

* The system must have a way to represent and balance zone imbalances (`𝑏𝑘` values).
* The iteration process requires access to the current state of all zones in the system.
* The process assumes that there are some external factors influencing the imbalance factor, such as driver behavior or traffic conditions.
