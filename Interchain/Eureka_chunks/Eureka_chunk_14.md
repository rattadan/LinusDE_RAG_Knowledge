## Eureka - Chunk 14

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

The security council is composed of individuals associated with well-respected and trusted entities in the Ethereum and Cosmos communities:

Wildcat Finance
Informal
Hypha
ZK Validator
Chorus One
Coinbase Cloud
Interchain Labs
​
Pausing council
The pausing council is designated for rapid-response to a security incident. The only actions that the pausing council can take are pausing and unpausing transfers out of the Ethereum-side contracts. The council is composed of a subset of people in the Security Council who are going to be rapidly responding to security incidents related to canonical IBC Eureka deployments. The actions of the pausing council are not time-locked to allow for a quick response time. ​
Governance stage (1)
After the protocol has successfully launched, the next step in the IBC Eureka roadmap is to allow general contract message passing between chains. This will enable canonical EVM Eureka deployments to be controlled by Cosmos Hub governance.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides specific technical details and parameters on potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols:

**Technical Details:**

1. Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) - potential for timeouts or slippage, where tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if issues arise.
2. Axelar GMP - slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts and slippage issues.
3. Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP) - reliance on Circle's attestation service, which can lead to funds being inaccessible due to service outages or limitations in availability.
4. Hyperlane - secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs), with a multisig ISM that requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing, potentially leading to funds being inaccessible until the threshold is achieved.

**Contextual Connection and Requirements:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context of the document, which provides an overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. The current text chunk expands on this by detailing specific technical details and parameters related to these protocols.

The following requirements are mentioned:

* **User Education:** Informing users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
* **Risk Management:** Encouraging users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures, with recommendations for developer best practices.
* **Developer Best Practices:** Implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

The chunk also mentions specific conditions that can lead to issues:

* **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP):** Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available due to limitations in availability.
* **Hyperlane:** The multisig ISM requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations, potentially leading to funds being inaccessible if the threshold is not met.

Overall, this chunk provides detailed technical information on potential failure points in cross-chain asset transfer protocols, which can inform developer best practices and user education efforts.
