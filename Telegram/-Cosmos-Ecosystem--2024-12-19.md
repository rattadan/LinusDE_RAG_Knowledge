## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the important information.

Starting with the latest messages at the top. Asa332 mentions an amount around 110 or 170 but can't remember exactly. Not sure if that's critical, maybe note it as uncertain. Then rcjulin_ForkDAO sends a greeting, probably not important. The unknown user talks about pinned messages having contacts of representatives, which is useful info but maybe not a key decision.

Looking further down, another unknown user tags representatives for Sputnik Network, collaborations, and provides links to their website, Twitter, Telegram, etc. That's contact info and resources. AnubisPhy has a message about revealing harvest and promoting sharing on social media. They mention a Twitter post, so maybe a community engagement point.

Asa32 shares a link to a Cosmos Ecosystem tweet. Forthex and PaulBMS have a GM message, a space link. Serranoooooo suggests a collaboration with Forthex. AnubisPhy again talks about liquidity ratio and a link to a tweet. Another unknown user mentions a collaboration between Sputnik Network and Source Protocol, with a StakeDrop for $SOURCE stakers and NFT holders, plus a liquidity pool on mainnet. That's a key collaboration and token distribution detail.

Crypto_back_up comments on improved rewards but criticizes a previous airdrop as low. Faneatiku mentions their chain allowing tokens to create staking programs, rewarding lock-ups. Asa332 again talks about testnet rewards and the need to top up gas fees with ATOM. Adr868 shares a YouTube link about ATOM Hacker House. 

So key points: collaborations between Sputnik and Source Protocol, StakeDrop eligibility, liquidity pool launch, Anubis's liquidity ratio, community engagement efforts like sharing harvests, and the Elys network's airdrop details with gas fee requirements. Also, mentions of resources like websites, social media links, and GitHub. Decisions might include the StakeDrop program, liquidity pool creation, and the promotion of their platforms through social sharing.

I need to make sure to present this concisely, highlighting the main collaborations, token distribution plans, liquidity info, and any decisions made. Also note

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. The text is a series of chat messages from different users on a platform, maybe Telegram or Discord, given the context of Cosmos and app-chains.

First, I need to go through each message and identify the key topics mentioned. Let me start by reading each line carefully.

The first message from Asa332 mentions amounts like 110 or 170, but they can't remember the exact figure. That seems like a discussion about token amounts or rewards, maybe related to airdrops or staking rewards.

Next, rcjulin_ForkDAO says "Hi all the cosmos üëåüßâüëçüí°". The emojis might indicate a friendly greeting, but the main topic here is probably the Cosmos ecosystem since they mention "cosmos".

Then, an unknown user refers to the pinned message and finding contacts of representatives. That's about community management or support, pointing to where people can find official contacts.

Another unknown user tags someone representing Sputnik Network and mentions their app-chain. They also list various links like the website, Twitter, Telegram, GitHub, etc. So the topics here are Sputnik Network, app-chain, and possibly collaboration since they mention representatives for questions.

AnubisPhy's message talks about revealing $ANUBI harvest over 24 hours, mentioning a bounty and sharing on X. This seems related to a token ($ANUBI), staking rewards, and social media promotion.

Asa332 shares a link to a Cosmos Ecosystem tweet. So that's part of the Cosmos ecosystem again.

Forthex and PaulBMS mention a live space on X (Twitter) involving Ar.io and KYVE. That's about Twitter Spaces and collaborations between projects.

Serranoooooo suggests a collaboration with Forthex, so collaboration is a topic here.

AnubisPhy again talks about liquidity ratios (84% against marketcap) on GeckoTerminal, indicating topics related to liquidity, marketcap, and maybe tokenomics.

Another unknown user discusses a collaboration between Sputnik Network and Source Protocol, mentioning $SOURCE-stakers, NFT-holders, and a $SIGNAL StakeDrop. So collaboration, staking, NFTs, and token distribution are topics here.

Crypto_back_up comments on rewards being low, comparing before and after a

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people and wants to know the overall sentiment. First, I need to go through each message one by one and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Then, I'll see if there's an overall trend.

Starting with Asa332's first message: "I guess it was around 110 or 170 or something. can't remember what was the right amount". That seems neutral. They're just trying to recall a number, no clear emotion here.

Next, rcjulin_ForkDAO says "Hi all the cosmos üëåüßâüëçüí°". Definitely positive. The emojis are friendly and upbeat.

Unknown at 2024-12-19T17:53:20: "In the pinned message, in every topi, you always can find contacts of representatives". Neutral again. It's a factual statement about where to find information.

Another unknown message with links and mentions of Sputnik Network. It's providing information and contacts, so neutral. No emotional language.

AnubisPhy's message about harvest and being blessed by Anubis. They use words like "blessed", "scales of Ma'at weigh your bounty", and encourage sharing. The language is enthusiastic, so positive.

Asa332's next message is a link. Neutral since it's just sharing a URL without commentary.

Forthex: "üî• yes, lets talk". The fire emoji and agreement indicate positive sentiment.

PaulBMS: "Gm gm," and a link to a space. "Gm" (good morning) in crypto communities is usually friendly, so positive.

Serranoooooo: "@Forthex Maybe a collaboration could be considered üëÄ". The eye emoji might suggest intrigue, but it's a suggestion, so probably neutral or slightly positive. Maybe neutral since it's a proposal without strong emotion.

AnubisPhy again mentions liquidity ratio and faith of holders. Words like "testament", "unwavering faith", "greatness awaits" are positive. They're highlighting positive stats, so positive.

Another unknown message about Sputnik and Source Protocol collaboration. Emojis like üî≠ and mentions of stakedrop and mainnet launch are positive. Collaborations are usually seen as good news.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any tasks, decisions made, or steps that someone should take next.

Starting with the first message from Asa332 at 2024-12-19T19:34:32. They mention something about an amount around 110 or 170 but can't remember the exact figure. This seems like a note to self or a question, but since they're unsure, maybe there's an action item here to check or confirm the correct amount. But since it's a statement of uncertainty, perhaps it's just a point to note, not an explicit action item.

Next, rcjulin_ForkDAO's message is a greeting, so no action items there. Then, the unknown user at 17:53:20 talks about pinned messages having contacts of representatives. That's more informational, maybe indicating that people should check the pinned messages for contact info, but not an action item per se.

The unknown user at 17:52:46 provides several contacts for Sputnik Network: @wlkatja for app-chain questions, @antropocosmist for collaborations and development. They also list various links like the webpage, Twitter, Telegram, etc. So here, the action items could be reaching out to those specific people for questions or using the provided links. But since the user is asking to extract action items, maybe the key points are the contacts and the resources available.

AnubisPhy's message at 17:26:38 is a call for Anubians to share their harvest and engage on Twitter. The action here is to share captures on Twitter or in the chat, like and share the provided link. So that's an action item: users should post their harvests.

Asa332's message at 17:04:51 is a link to a Cosmos Ecosystem tweet. Probably just sharing information, not an action item unless the link itself is a next step. But since the user is to extract action items, maybe not unless specified.

Forthex at 14:07:31 says "yes, lets talk" which might indicate a decision to proceed with a discussion, but
