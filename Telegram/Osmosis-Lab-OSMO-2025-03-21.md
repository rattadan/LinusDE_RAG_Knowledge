## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message and pick out the important stuff.

Starting from the latest messages and moving up. The first one is osmosis_statbot sharing a support link. Not a key decision, just a support info. Then link_vector asks about Bitmosis rewards being in OSMO or BTC and others. BasementNodes responds that CL pools earn both tokens. That's a key point about Bitmosis rewards and CL pools.

Griffin_web3 shares a Medium link about Bitmosis. The user might want that mentioned as a reference. BasementNodes also shares a Twitter link, probably related to the same discussion. 

cosmosrescue asks if all Osmosis tokens are subject to IBC rate-limiting or just those on a specific list. Kychuli answers that it's the ones listed there, referencing a forum post. Important for understanding IBC policies.

User_343756695 makes predictions about prices going up to $5-$15 once QE starts, depending on Polaris and Bitmosis success. Also mentions Polaris launching in Q3 and a thirdning in July. Prices are linked to Fed policies and project launches. 

Osmogovbot mentions a proposal to whitelist Valence's address for contract uploads without governance approval. Key decision here is streamlining contract deployments for Valence, which is part of cross-chain development.

Mikesbarb talks about Polaris being the biggest upcoming event and suggests checking a spaces call for alpha. Link_vector asks for more alpha info and mentions being back in Osmosis since 2021. 

Other messages are about bridges, support links, and general positive comments. The main decisions and key points seem to be:

1. Bitmosis rewards and CL pools earning both tokens.
2. The Valence contract upload proposal to reduce friction.
3. IBC rate-limiting applying only to listed tokens.
4. Price predictions tied to Polaris, Bitmosis, and Fed actions.
5. Polaris as a major upcoming development with a spaces call for details.

I need to structure these points clearly, making sure to highlight decisions and important info. Avoid redundant links unless necessary, but mention the key resources like the Medium post and the governance proposal. Also, note the user's return after a long

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand what the text is about. Looking through the messages, they seem to be chat logs related to Osmosis, which is a blockchain project, probably in the Cosmos ecosystem.

The main topics mentioned here are things like Bitmosis, which is mentioned in a link and a question about rewards. There's also Polaris, referenced by a user talking about it being a big upcoming event. CL pools come up, where someone mentions earning in both tokens. IBC rate-limiting is discussed in a question about whether all tokens are subject to it. SquidRouter and Skip.Build are mentioned as bridges from Osmosis to EVM. The OSMO token is referenced in a buy message and price predictions. There's a mention of a DAO proposal related to Valence's deployment address. Also, some users are talking about returning to Osmosis after a long time and checking out recent developments.

I should make sure to identify all these topics. Let me list them out: Bitmosis, Polaris, CL pools (Concentrated Liquidity), IBC rate-limiting, bridges (SquidRouter, Skip.Build), OSMO token, price predictions, Valence deployment address proposal, DAO governance, cross-chain contracts, and returning to Osmosis. Maybe also check if there's anything else like the support site or the spaces call mentioned. But the main ones are the projects and features specific to Osmosis. I need to present these as a clean list without duplicates and in a concise manner.

Bitmosis, Polaris, Concentrated Liquidity (CL) pools, IBC rate-limiting, Osmosis bridges (SquidRouter, Skip.Build), OSMO token price predictions, Valence deployment address proposal, DAO governance, cross-chain contracts, returning to Osmosis, support site (https://support.osmosis.zone), recent developments in Osmosis, cross-chain financial applications, token rewards (Osmo/BTC/other tokens), thirdning event in July, QE (Quantitative Easing) impact on prices, and spaces call alpha.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from Osmosis, and I need to go through each one and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. 

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a link to the support site. That's just providing help, so probably neutral.

Next, link_vector says "Oh nice ojk". The "oh nice" sounds positive, but "ojk" might be a typo or slang. Maybe they meant "OK"? If so, positive. But without knowing, I'll stick with the words. "Oh nice" is positive, so maybe positive.

BasementNodes mentions earning in both tokens with CL pools. That's a factual statement, but it's explaining a feature. Neutral? Unless the context implies satisfaction, but since it's just stating a fact, neutral.

Then BasementNodes again says "bc they are paid as fees". Also factual, so neutral.

griffin_web3 shares a Medium link. Just sharing content, neutral.

BasementNodes shares a Twitter link. Again, neutral.

link_vector asks about rewards in OSMO or BTC. It's a question, so neutral.

osmosis_statbot another support link. Neutral.

orionas_cosmos says "Hope you would find value..." and mentions a thread. The hope and the üî• emoji suggest positive sentiment.

Another link from orionas_cosmos. Neutral.

freedomforfools says "perfect, thanks!" which is clearly positive.

kychuli shares a bridge link. Neutral.

freedomforfools asks for a bridge suggestion. Question, neutral.

cosmosrescue says "ah, thanks, I'll check this". Positive because of gratitude.

kychuli says "references range a lot..." which seems positive, maybe excited about possibilities. So positive.

kychuli shares another link. Neutral.

kychuli says "i think its the ones listed there". Neutral, just answering a question.

cosmosrescue asks about IBC rate-limiting. Question, neutral.

user_5920371783 says "Osmosis buy buyüöÄüöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è". The emojis and repetition of "buy" indicate strong positive sentiment.

user_343756695 talks about QE starting and prices going up. Positive, optimistic about future prices.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the given chat messages. Let me go through each message one by one.

First, the user mentions "osmosis_statbot" providing a support link. That's just a support announcement, no action needed here.

Then there's "link_vector" asking about Bitmosis rewards payout. BasementNodes responds with a link. Not sure if that's a next step. Wait, the question is from link_vector: they want to know if rewards will be in Osmo or BTC and other tokens. That's a question, but maybe the next step is to check the provided link for info.

Another message from "osmogovbot" mentions a proposal to whitelist Valence's deployment address. The proposal is to allow uploading contracts without individual approvals. The action item here might be to review or vote on this proposal. The user is tagged as @maximus, so maybe he needs to take action.

"mikebarb" says to check out the recent spaces call for Polaris alpha. So the next step for others would be to listen to that call if they haven't.

"link_vector" asks if there's any other alpha for the next months. Mikebarb responds about Polaris being the biggest thing. Not an action item, but maybe the user should look into that.

"freedomforfools" asks for a bridge suggestion from Osmosis to EVM. Kychuli provides two links: squidrouter and skip.build. So the next step for freedomforfools is to use those bridges.

"cosmosrescue" asks about IBC rate-limiting applying to all tokens or just those on range.org. Kychuli says it's the ones listed there. So the decision is that only tokens on range.org are subject, and the next step might be to check that list.

"orionas_cosmos" shares a Twitter thread about OSMO. The action could be to check out the thread.

"griffin_web3" shares a Medium article about Bitmosis. Maybe read the article as a next step.

Then there are some speculative messages about prices and timelines, but those are opinions, not actionable items.

Putting it all together:

- Review and vote on the Valence deployment address proposal.
- Check the spaces call for Polaris alpha.
- Use squidrouter or skip.build bridges.
- Check range
