## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I'll go through each message to extract important information.

The first message mentions the Prize Page on Notion being updated with prize details. There's a link provided. Then, the Hackathon Prize Pool doubled to $20,000 USDC because ATOM Accelerator added another $10,000, matching Neutron's original contribution. That's a significant financial update.

Next, there's a message stating that the results will be announced tomorrow. Then, another message confirming that today is the last day of the ATOM Hacker House. So the event is ending soon.

There's a greeting from rcjulin_ForkDAO addressing the Cosmos community. Asa332 shared a link about the Elys Airdrop update and another tweet from CosmosEcosystem. The earlier messages mention the last two days of the event, indicating Saturday and Sunday as the final days, and mention the Telegram link for CosmosEcosystem. The user also notes that after the event, there will be more tools and dApps on Cosmos and Neutron.

I need to structure this in a way that highlights the prize pool increase, the event conclusion dates, the results announcement, and the future developments. Also, the social media and communication channels (Notion, X, Telegram) are important for context. The key decisions here are the doubling of the prize pool and the conclusion of the Hacker House leading to new projects. I should avoid including the hashtags and the greetings unless they're relevant. Focus on the actionable and factual information: prize details, event timeline, funding sources, and post-event outcomes. Make sure the summary is clear and to the point without extra fluff.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, so I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. 

The first message mentions a Prize Page on Notion that's been updated with prize details. There's a link to that Notion page. Then the next message talks about the Hackathon Prize Pool doubling to $20,000 USDC for ATOM Hacker House, with ATOM Accelerator adding $10,000 and Neutron funding the original $10,000. There's a link to a Twitter post here as well.

Another message says "Tomorrow will be results" and "Friends, today is the last day of ATOM Hacker House." So that's about the conclusion of the event and upcoming results. 

Then there's a message from rcjulin_ForkDAO greeting everyone with cosmos emojis. Asa332 shares a link to a Twitter post and mentions an Elys Airdrop update. 

The rest include the hashtag #ATOMHackerHouse, mention InterChain Stack at the same hashtag, a Telegram link, and a message about the last two days being Saturday and Sunday, leading to more tools and dApps on Cosmos and Neutron.

So, main topics here are the ATOM Hacker House event, the prize pool doubling to $20k USDC, the collaboration between ATOM Accelerator and Neutron in funding, the upcoming results, the event's conclusion today, the mention of Cosmos and Neutron ecosystems, Elys Airdrop update, InterChain Stack, and the use of the hashtag #ATOMHackerHouse. Also, there are links to Notion, Twitter, and Telegram, but maybe those are resources rather than topics. 

Wait, should the links be considered topics? The user probably wants the topics related to the content, not the links themselves. So focusing on the subjects discussed. 

Putting it all together, the main topics would be ATOM Hacker House, Prize Pool Doubling, $20,000 USDC, ATOM Accelerator, Neutron Funding, Event Conclusion, Upcoming Results, Cosmos Ecosystem, Elys Airdrop Update, InterChain Stack. Maybe also the dates (last day is today, Saturday and Sunday as last days) but perhaps that's part of the event timeline. The hashtag #ATOMHackerHouse is a topic as it's used repeatedly.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. The user provided a series of chat messages, and I have to determine if each is positive, negative, or neutral. Wait, actually, the initial instruction says "Analyze the sentiment of this text (positive/negative/neutral)" but then there are multiple messages here. Maybe they want an overall sentiment analysis of all the messages combined, or each individual one. The example response they provided seems to list each message with its own sentiment, so I should do that.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Let's start with the first one. The text is: "Prize Page on Notion now updated with prize details ‚Äî> [link]". Then it mentions the prize pool doubling to $20k USDC, with ATOM Accelerator adding $10k to the original $10k from Neutron. The emojis are fire and money. This sounds positive because they're announcing an increase in prizes, which is exciting. Words like "updated", "2x", "now reach a total" indicate positive news. The emojis reinforce that.

Next message: "Tomorrow will be results". That's straightforward. It's a statement about the future, neutral in itself unless context suggests otherwise. But since it's about a hackathon's results, maybe there's anticipation, but the sentence itself doesn't have emotional words. So neutral.

"Friends, today is the last day of ATOM Hacker House". The word "friends" is friendly, but the message is just stating a fact. The sentiment here might be neutral, unless the mention of the last day could be negative (sadness) or positive (excitement for conclusion). Without more context, probably neutral.

The message from rcjulin_ForkDAO: "Hi all the cosmos üßâü´°üåêüí™". The emojis here are a bit mixed. The drink (üßâ) might be a toast, the salute (ü´°), globe (üåê), and muscle (üí™) could indicate enthusiasm or a positive greeting. So positive.

Asa332's message: "Elys Airdrop update". Just a title, no sentiment words. Neutral.

Another message with a hashtag #ATOMHackerHouse and another about InterChain Stack at the same hashtag. These are just mentions, so neutral.

Then a link to Telegram and a message saying "Check the

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, and next steps from this text. First, I'll read through all the messages to understand the context.

The text seems to be a series of chat messages related to an event called ATOM Hacker House. There are mentions of prizes, updates, and the event ending. Let me go through each message one by one.

The first message says the Prize Page on Notion is updated with prize details and provides a link. That sounds like an action item to update the page, which has already been done. But maybe the next step is to check the link for details.

Next, there's a message about the prize pool doubling to $20,000 USDC because ATOM Accelerator added another $10,000. This seems like a decision that was made to increase the prize money. So the decision here is the prize pool increase.

Then, a message states that tomorrow will be the results. That indicates a next step or an upcoming event where results will be announced.

Another message mentions today is the last day of the event. So the next step is the event concluding today, leading to the results announcement.

The messages from rcjulin_ForkDAO and Asa332 seem to be greetings or sharing links, which might not have action items unless the links are important. The Elys Airdrop update might be a next step if there's an update to be checked.

The #ATOMHackerHouse and InterChain Stack mentions are probably just hashtags or topics, not actions. The message about Saturday and Sunday being the last two days (but the date here is 2024-12-07, which is a Saturday) suggests that the event ends on Sunday, so maybe the next steps include wrapping up the event and preparing for post-event activities like promoting the tools and dApps.

The other messages are greetings or sharing news links, which might imply that staying updated with the latest news is a next step.

Putting this all together, the main action items and next steps would be:

- The prize page has been updated (already done, but others should check it).
- The prize pool was doubled to $20,000 USDC (decision made).
- The event ends today (2024-12-07), with results coming tomorrow (next steps).
- Post-event, there will be
