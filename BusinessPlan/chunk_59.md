**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems like you're discussing the implementation process of a voting system within the nRide community after proposals are submitted. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

1. **Voting Process**: The proposal is first submitted to the community, and then members can vote on it during a specified period.
2. **Voting Period**: This voting period allows stakeholders to cast their votes for or against the proposal.
3. **Implementation**: If the proposal receives sufficient votes (i.e., more than a certain threshold), it will be implemented into the nRide protocol or ecosystem.

To summarize, the implementation of a proposal in the nRide community happens if enough votes are received during the voting period and is then implemented based on that outcome.
