## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 23

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

Travel Times
In the base case scenario, the travel time consists of roughly 23 minutes of walking time, eleven minutes of waiting
time (both at the origin and transfer stops) and 15 minutes of actual in vehicle travel. In the DRT cases, waiting times
are lower, whereas in vehicle travel times are somewhat higher. In the stop-based simulation, also the access and
egress walking times from stops are considerably lower than in the base case. While the average waiting times are
similar in both cases, they are not spread evenly over the city, as figure 4.2 reveals. Especially in door to door mode,
these are often considerably higher in less central areas. 4.3. Fleet utilization
While the demand in both simulation runs is the same, the door to door based system still transports slightly
more rides than the stop-based system, where some agents walk if their access and egress stop are the same. This
results in 21 346 daily requests being served in the door to door mode versus 21 292 requests in the stop-based mode.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the **operational costs** of different DRT (Demand Responsive Transport) systems, specifically focusing on the travel times and waiting times associated with these systems.

Here's a breakdown of the technical details:

* The travel time consists of walking, waiting at stops, and in-vehicle travel.
* Average walking time: 23 minutes
* Waiting time:
 + Origin and transfer stops: 11 minutes each
 + Door-to-door system: higher than base case (15 minutes)
* Fleet utilization comparison:
 + Stop-based system transports slightly more rides due to increased walking times in central areas.

In terms of context, this chunk connects to the surrounding discussion about operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization. It also builds upon previous discussions by providing specific numbers and comparisons between different scenarios.

The requirements for analysis are:

* Understanding of simulation models used to evaluate DRT systems
* Familiarity with travel time and cost components
* Ability to compare and contrast different scenarios

Some constraints or conditions mentioned include:

* The study assumes constant usage patterns for other modes (e.g., car users)
* Future studies should consider the impact of attractive DRT systems on mode choice, as this is a critical aspect of transportation planning.
