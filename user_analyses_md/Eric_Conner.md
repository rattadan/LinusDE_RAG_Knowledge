* The tone is critical, with a touch of optimism.

**Language style and tone:**

* Critical language is used ("trash talking", "crushes other chains"), which indicates a negative attitude.
* Optimistic language is used ("changing for the better", "much more") to counterbalance this criticism.

**Key characteristics of communication:**

* They employ rhetorical devices such as hyperbole ("price won't walk up when it catches up", "teleport"), which adds emphasis and drama to their argument.
* The use of quotes (e.g. "EF changing for the better") creates a sense of authority and expertise, even though they are not presenting a formal or technical analysis.
