## Chunk 88

**Original Text:**

The foreseeable reasons why nRide would be banned from
the App Store are related to anti-money-laundering concerns
associated with the use of blockchain. nRide will implement
all the appropriate AML processes to meet Appleâ€™s
requirements. Inadequate MVP testing group:When nRide launches,
even in Beta testing, it needs a pool of users that actually use
the app to request rides and go places. The risk is of selecting
an initial testing group that doesn't interact with each other
and doesn't actually use the application for everyday
journeys. The testing group is carefully chosen, with people who live or
work in a common location and who are regular taxi
users/drivers.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The text mentions several reasons why nRide may be banned from the App Store due to concerns related to anti-money-laundering (AML) and other regulatory requirements.

These concerns include:

1. Anti-money laundering: The use of blockchain and ride-hailing services like nRide raises concerns about money laundering, as users may attempt to conceal their identities or hide illicit transactions.
2. Inadequate MVP testing: The App Store requires a minimum viable product (MVP) before it can be submitted for review. If the MVP testing group is not representative of real-world usage patterns and does not engage with the target audience regularly, it may not meet Apple's requirements.

These concerns are likely related to the following regulations:

* Anti-Money Laundering Regulations: Many countries have implemented regulations aimed at preventing money laundering, which can be a concern for financial institutions and other services that facilitate transactions.
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance: The GDPR requires organizations to implement robust security measures to protect user data, including ensuring that personal information is not misused or sold without consent. Blockchain-based services like nRide may face challenges in meeting these regulations.
* Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS): While not specifically related to anti-money laundering, PCI-DSS is a widely adopted standard for securing payment card information, which can be relevant to blockchain-based services that handle sensitive user data.

It's worth noting that Apple has not publicly disclosed specific reasons why nRide was banned from the App Store. However, these concerns highlight potential challenges that the company may face in developing and launching its service while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
