Putting some tweets in the context of intentions:

- The frequent "Good Morning #Crypto" posts with emojis suggest an effort to become a familiar daily presence in followers' feeds and build a sense of community
- The tweet asking "Which Crypto? üëá" with "Buy before 1000x" frames the account's overall intention - to position itself as a speculative guide to crypto investing
- The "Shill your next üëÄüî•" tweet suggests the account may be open to promoting various crypto projects for potential gain
- The "Memecoins pumping" tweet shows alignment with the more speculative and hype-driven segments of the crypto community
