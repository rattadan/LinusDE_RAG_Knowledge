# User Analysis: Ambedo_Bass

## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze two tweets from an account called Ambedo_Bass. First, I need to break down each part of the request.

Starting with the main topics. The first tweet talks about hyperliquid EVM dexes having high volume. The second mentions IBC eureka stuff and a stride dex announcement, which made the person think about leaving the Cosmos project. So the main themes are probably DeFi, EVM, Cosmos, and maybe the Stride DEX. 

Next, the language style. The user uses phrases like "Dang, kinda surprised" which is casual and a bit informal. They mention specific projects and technical terms, so the tone is knowledgeable but not overly technical. Maybe a bit of a mix between casual and professional.

Legitness evaluation. The user is talking about specific projects, so if they're a known figure in the crypto space, that's a plus. But without more context, it's hard to say. The mention of leaving Cosmos might indicate they were involved in that project before, so maybe they have some credibility. But I should note that without more info, it's hard to evaluate.

The ecosystem they advertise. The tweets mention EVM dexes, IBC, Cosmos, and Stride DEX. So the projects are likely in the DeFi and Cosmos ecosystems. Maybe the user is promoting these projects or discussing their developments.

Character evaluation. The language is casual, maybe a bit laid-back. The mention of leaving Cosmos could indicate a change in focus or a shift in interest. The user might be a former Cosmos developer or investor. Their tone is reflective, showing they're thinking about past projects. Motivations could be staying updated in DeFi, maybe seeking new opportunities. Emotional patterns might be thoughtful, with a focus on community and project growth. Decision-making seems to be based on observations and reactions to project developments.

Putting it all together, the user is likely a crypto enthusiast, maybe a former Cosmos participant, interested in DeFi and EVM projects. They might be sharing insights or updates about these projects, possibly to engage the community or discuss their own experiences.

Keywords: DeFi, EVM, Cosmos, IBC, Stride DEX. These are the main terms from the tweets. Need to make sure they're relevant and capture the essence of the content.
