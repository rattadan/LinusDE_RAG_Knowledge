### Document Overview  
The content outlines Noble.xyz's announcements about EURe (a Euro-backed stablecoin in the IBC ecosystem) and CCTP (a bridge to USDC on the Cosmos ecosystem), emphasizing their role in expanding the Cosmos ecosystem and enabling USDC native issuance on the Noble blockchain.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Euro-backed stablecoin (EURe)**: A stablecoin pegged to the euro, positioned as the first in the $30 billion IBC ecosystem.  
- **Cosmos ecosystem**: A decentralized blockchain network with interoperability (IBC) and token bridging.  
- **USDC (USD Coin)**: A stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, bridged through Noble’s network.  
- **Native USDC**: USDC issued on the Noble blockchain, distinct from bridged forms.  
- **Celestia rollups**: A layer-2 solution on the Celestia blockchain for efficient transaction processing and scalability.  
- **Inter-Blockchain Connectivity (IBC)**: A protocol enabling cross-chain communication and asset transfer between blockchains.  

### Implementation Details  
- **EURe**: Launched as the first Euro-backed stablecoin in the IBC ecosystem, with a focus on Euro liquidity and interoperability.  
- **CCTP (Cosmos Token Bridge Protocol)**: A bridge enabling seamless access to USDC on the Cosmos ecosystem, enhancing UX and liquidity.  
- **Native USDC**: Issued on the Noble blockchain, allowing direct use without bridging, and differentiated from bridged forms via governance and liquidity.  
- **Celestia Rollups**: Noble’s plan to bring USDC and native asset issuance to Celestia rollups, leveraging layer-2 scaling.  

### Related Topics  
- **Cosmos ecosystem**: The broader network where CCTP and EURe operate, emphasizing interoperability and token bridging.  
- **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Connectivity)**: The protocol enabling cross-chain communication, critical for EURe and CCTP.  
- **Native vs. bridged USDC**: Technical distinctions in issuance models and governance, relevant to the discussion of native USDC.  
- **Celestia rollups**: The specific layer-2 solution being integrated for USDC, linking to Noble’s blockchain strategy.
