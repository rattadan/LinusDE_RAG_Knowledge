## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 55

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

In this section, we present our own repositioning approach that
overcomes both issues. The main idea is to create zones around each
parking lot (referred to as parking lot zones), covering the area that
can be reached by the vehicles in these parking lots within a specific
timeframe. Later, we will also refer to this area as the range of a parking
lot, a vehicle, or a request. By setting this timeframe to the maximum
waiting time ùëáùëä and assuming that the incoming requests follow a
Poisson distribution, we can calculate for each lot the probability of at
least one missed request due to undersupply in this area. In the repositioning process, these probabilities can be minimized to maximize the
number of served requests. We will refer to this strategy as the undersupply probability strategy.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining a technical detail within ride-hailing systems and operations, specifically:

1. The exact technical details: The "undersupply probability strategy" refers to an optimization approach used in dynamic trip-vehicle assignment for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets.
2. Context connection: This section builds upon the context of existing research on optimizing ride-hailing system operations, particularly the use of machine learning techniques and advanced modeling approaches (e.g., simulation studies).
3. Requirements and constraints:
   - The specific timeframe to calculate probabilities is set to the maximum waiting time ùëáùëä.
   - Incoming requests follow a Poisson distribution.

This section aims to explain how an "undersupply probability strategy" is implemented, providing technical details for optimizing ride-hailing system operations through real-world vehicle repositioning in dynamic trip-vehicle assignment.
