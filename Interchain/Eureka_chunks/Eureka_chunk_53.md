## Eureka - Chunk 53

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

The most common ISM is a Multisig ISM where “Validators” of a specific Hyperlane route sign attestations that a specific message on an origin chain is a valid message to be processed on the destination chain. In the case where the set of Validators have not hit the required signature threshold to successfully process a Hyperlane message on the receiving chain, funds will not be accessible by the user on either chain until the threshold is met (once met, funds will be sent to the user on the destination chain). This generalizes to the different requirements for different ISMs. The Hyperlane documentation explains the different types of ISMs in more detail: https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/ISM/specify-your-ISM

​
Go Fast Failures
If a transfer timeout occurs, meaning a user’s intent does not receive a response from solvers within a predefined time frame, the solver initiates a refund process to ensure that users do not lose funds.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining technical details and parameters related to cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast.

Here's a breakdown of what this chunk is explaining:

**Technical Details:**

1. **Multisig ISM**: The Multisig ISM requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
2. **Hyperlane ISMs**: There are different types of Hyperlane ISMs, including the Multisig ISM and the Priority Multi-hop Relaying ISM (HMRS).
3. **Timeout mechanisms**: The text mentions timeout mechanisms in Go Fast, such as the intent expiration process and refund mechanism.

**Parameters and Processes:**

1. **Required signature threshold**: The Multisig ISM requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
2. **Priority Multi-hop Relaying ISM (HMRS)**: This is a priority multi-hop relaying protocol that can improve transaction success rates.
3. **Hyperlane documentation**: The Hyperlane website provides more detailed information on the different types of ISMs.

**Connections to and Building upon surrounding context:**

1. The text builds upon the surrounding context by providing specific technical details and parameters related to cross-chain asset transfer protocols.
2. It also references other topics, such as user education, risk management, and developer best practices, which are mentioned in additional sections of the document.

**Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

1. The text mentions that users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.
2. It also highlights potential delays or failures due to timeout mechanisms or other factors.
