## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 26

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

Fleet occupancy in the door to door case (400 vehicles, left) and stop-based case (300 vehicles, right). drivers. The schedule based transport is currently serving roughly 5.5 million kilometers annually. This breaks down
to roughly 18 000 km per work day. This would translate into operational costs of 42 840 EUR for the current system,
including costs for drivers. Under these circumstances, both DRT systems using driverless eight-seat vans are likely to
operate cheaper than the current schedule based public transport system with drivers. However, the cost calculation has
some limitations, as the model has a clear focus on depicting peak and commuting traffic. Therefore, the operational
costs of the DRT service might in fact be somewhat higher. Still, self driving DRT systems are likely to be competitive
with current schedule based transport with drivers. 5. Conclusion
A full automation of vehicles will have disruptive effects on public transport operations, as MaaS providers may
start competing against them.
