## Impact assessment of autonomous DRT system - Chunk 28

**Document Summary:**

The paper discusses the potential impact of a fully automated Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) system on traditional public transport operations using Cottbus, Germany as a case study. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - The simulation models both stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
   - It evaluates the operational costs, travel times, and vehicle utilization.

2. **Travel Times and Costs Comparison**:
   - **Stop-Based System**: Lower operating costs but higher travel times compared to traditional public transport.
   - **Door-to-Door System**: Further reduced travel times for passengers, potentially cheaper to operate than traditional schedule-based transport when considering driverless operation.

3. **Operational Cost Analysis**:
   - Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Door-to-door system (assuming driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost.
   - Traditional public transport: Currently serving 5.5 million kilometers annually at a higher cost.

4. **Impact on Public Transport**:
   - The study suggests that DRT systems could operate more efficiently with lower costs, potentially disrupting traditional public transport operations due to competition from MaaS providers.

5. **Potential for Mode Choice and Optimized Operation**:
   - The model assumes users of other modes will remain constant.
   - Future studies should consider how an attractive DRT system might influence mode choice (e.g., drawing car users).

6. **Limitations and Further Research**:
   - The current modeling approach focuses on peak and commuting traffic, which may not fully capture the operational costs under all scenarios.
   - More variations in service models need to be evaluated, such as limited stop usage during peak hours.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Fully automated DRT systems could be competitive with traditional public transport if designed optimally.
   - The paper highlights that a switch to DRT would require comprehensive planning and integration into broader mobility ecosystems.

Overall, the study provides insights into how autonomous DRT services might reshape urban transportation landscapes, particularly in comparison to existing public transport models.

**Original Text:**

The current modeling approach assumes that a switch to a DRT
system will leave the users of other modes than public transport as they are. However, it is likely that an attractive
DRT system will also attract car users as well as cyclists and pedestrians. Further studies should thus take mode choice
into consideration. The current, iteration based simulation approach in principal allows for this, however the required
mode choice parameters for driver-less MaaS services are hard to estimate and need yet to be found.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* Simulation models used: stop-based and door-to-door DRT systems.
* Evaluation metrics:
	+ Operational costs
	+ Travel times
	+ Vehicle utilization
* Cost estimates:
	+ Stop-based system: ~30,191 EUR daily operational cost
	+ Door-to-door system (driverless): ~32,653 EUR daily operational cost

**Context Connection and Building Upon Surrounding Context:**

This chunk of text is building upon the surrounding context by:

1. Referring to a simulation approach, which is mentioned in point 2 ("Simulation Approach") as part of the discussion on DRT systems.
2. Providing specific estimates for operational costs under both stop-based and door-to-door DRT models, which adds credibility to the claims made about their potential impact on traditional public transport operations.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

* The current modeling approach assumes a switch to a DRT system would leave other modes' users unaffected, but acknowledges that attractive DRT systems might also attract car users.
* Further studies are needed to estimate mode choice parameters for driver-less MaaS services and consider variations in service models (e.g., limited stop usage during peak hours).
* The current iteration-based simulation approach is presented as the primary method of evaluation.
