## ICS - Chunk 20

**Document Summary:**

The development of Interchain Security (ICS) for the Cosmos ecosystem represents a significant milestone that paves the way for greater interoperability, security, and economic growth among blockchain networks. Here are some key points summarizing the current state and future outlook:

### Key Achievements:
1. **Replicated Security Launch:**
   - The first consumer chains have successfully launched with replicated security, sharing the validator set of the Cosmos Hub.
   - This model ensures that any attack on a consumer chain would impact the entire ecosystem as much as it would affect the Cosmos Hub itself.

2. **Opt-in Security Development:**
   - Informal Systems and other contributors are working to develop opt-in security, allowing validators to choose which chains they wish to secure independently.
   
3. **Subset Problem Resolution:**
   - The "subset problem" has been identified and is being addressed through the design of new governance proposals, like slash proposals, to mitigate potential attacks.

4. **Mesh Security Research:**
   - Ongoing research into mesh security aims to create a network of interdependent blockchains where validators can participate in multiple chains without compromising security.

### Upcoming Steps:
1. **Opt-in Security Implementation:**
   - Finalizing and deploying opt-in security will provide more flexibility for validators, allowing them to distribute their staked ATOM across different consumer zones.

2. **Mesh Security Design:**
   - Continuing the research and development of mesh security to ensure a robust and secure network of interconnected blockchains.
   
3. **Economic Zone Development:**
   - The ATOM Economic Zone is expected to bring innovative economic opportunities for its members, such as shared validator sets and enhanced inter-IBC functionalities.

4. **Interoperability Enhancements:**
   - Improving IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) functionality, including synchronous IBC, atomic IBC, and packet forwarding, to enhance user experience and security across the ecosystem.

### Long-term Vision:
1. **Sustainable Ecosystem Growth:**
   - By sharing the same validator set, consumer chains can benefit from increased security without needing their own validators, reducing costs and improving overall network resilience.
   
2. **Increased Adoption and Innovation:**
   - The interdependent nature of these blockchain networks is expected to drive innovation and adoption, as developers can leverage the combined strengths of multiple blockchains.

3. **Economic Opportunities:**
   - ATOM holders and validators will have more avenues for earning transaction fees and MEV (Miner Extracted Value) rewards across various zones.
   
### Conclusion:
The launch of Interchain Security marks a significant advancement in the interoperability landscape, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure blockchain ecosystem. As development continues, the Cosmos ecosystem is poised to offer new opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration among its members.

**Original Text:**

Sunny's insight is that instead of taking the validator set of the provider chain(s), you can allow delegators on those provider chains to delegate to validators in the consumer chain's own validator set, using the provider chain's token (which remains bonded on the provider chain). Since there is no longer any need to take a subset of provider validators, you avoid the subset problem. We've analyzed this carefully from many angles, and at this point we can say that it seems secure in theory. The security of any potential implementation is a different matter. There are some factors and settings which need to be considered carefully which I won't get into here, but it can work in principle. Of course this is not a final determination, but if nothing unexpected comes up, we foresee a future with Mesh Security on the Cosmos Hub. Comparing Replicated and Mesh Security
We've created a mathematical model which encompasses both replicated and mesh security (and other types of shared security).

**Technical Details:**
The technical details mentioned are as follows:
- "Validator set" refers to a group of validators responsible for maintaining the integrity and order of a blockchain network.
- "Token" is a type of cryptocurrency, in this case, Cosmos Hub's token (also referred to as ATOM).
- "Delegators" are users who delegate their tokens or assets to validators on another chain.
