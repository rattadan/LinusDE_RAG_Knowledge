**Original Text:**

PUDO events with seniors lead to even more prolonged stop times. In seven instances where oversized baggage required safe storage before the trip could
continue, a significant effect on stop times was observed. These stops have a mean stop
time of 97.43 s and a median stop time of 64.0 s, which is three times as high as the overall
median stop time. Regression model
The model results are summarised in Table 4. The Durbin-Watson statistic for the models is an indication of negligible autocorrelation among residuals. The Breuschâ€“Pagan test
yields a Lagrange Multiplier statistic of 28.36 (boarding) and 46.23 (alighting), both with
a corresponding p-value < 0.001, suggesting the presence of heteroskedasticity which
necessitates the use of heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. Consequently, we
utilised HC3 standard errors to ensure robustness. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) assessments for the independent variables indicate minimal concern for multicollinearity, with
the highest VIF being less than 1.15.
