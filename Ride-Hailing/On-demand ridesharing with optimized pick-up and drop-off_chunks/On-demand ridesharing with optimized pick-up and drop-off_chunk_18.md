**Original Text:**

Regarding more flexible shared systems, Stiglic et al. (2015), Li et al. (2018) also consider meeting points, which are selected from a
set that does not contain all of the nodes in the city, for systems in which private drivers seek for travelers with whom to share their
routes; Kaan and Olinick (2013) study meeting points reachable by car, in a scheme in which different commuters share a common
destination; and Fielbaum (2020) considers a feeder SMoD system, in which passengers are also gathered together, over a simplified
scheme in which it is not necessary to model how to assign the requests together, thanks to its regularity assumptions. Note that all
these papers decide meeting points, where all the co-travelers sharing a vehicle have to move, instead of designating one pick-up and
one drop-off location per passenger, as we do in this paper.
