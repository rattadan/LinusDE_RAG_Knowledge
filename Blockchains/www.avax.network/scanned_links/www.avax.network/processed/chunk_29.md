This use case highlights how AutoPenâs technology can be repurposed to meet a variety of needs beyond legal signatures.Â

One of the knock-on effects of AutoPen is that users end up with a crypto wallet. This unintended consequence is key to how the company is thinking about the future. Cammi envisions a future where every person in Latin America has a crypto wallet without even realizing it. By onboarding users through a familiar and necessary service like digital signatures, AutoPen introduces people to Web3 in a way that feels natural.Â

Â âOur users wonât need to know anything about crypto,â Cammi says. âTheyâll just see a better, faster, and more secure way to get things done.â The infrastructure AutoPen is building will create a bridge between traditional legal processes and the decentralized world of Web3. Users will be able to access a broader ecosystem of decentralized applications and services without needing specialized knowledge. This approach lowers the barriers to entry and accelerates Web3 adoption.

Codebase played a crucial role in Autopenâs journey. The incubator provided more than just financial backing. It offered mentorship, resources, and a community that helped Cammi and his team refine their vision and build a scalable product. Codebaseâs support also helped the team tell their story in a way that resonates with investors and users alike. âCodebase didnât just give us money,â Cammi says. âThey helped us tell our story in a way that connects emotionally with people. That emotional connection is what drives adoption.â

Autopenâs success is a testament to how targeted support can help founders solve real-world problems. âSuccess in one year means owning the digital signature space in Argentina,â Cammi says. âBut success in five years means building a digital infrastructure where signatures, identity, and intention all flow seamlessly through Web3 technology.
