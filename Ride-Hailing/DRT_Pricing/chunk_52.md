**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that you're analyzing the performance of a Public Transport (PT) system, specifically focusing on the Darmstadt Regional Transport (DRT) service area in Berlin.

From what I can gather:

- The jump in iteration 400 seems to be attributed to switching off the innovative strategies (disabling choice set generation). This implies that when this switch was made, it may have reduced the efficiency or effectiveness of some aspect of the PT system.
 
- Computation time over iterations is measured at different values:
  - For car users: 0.15 seconds per trip
  - For bicycle users: 0.25 seconds per trip (bicycle), 0.2 seconds per trip (no choice set generation)
  
- Mode share (percentage of users using each mode) over the iterations is shown in Figure 1, which indicates that:
  - The DRT service area sees an increase in car usage and a decrease in bicycle usage
  - Walkers account for a small percentage of users

It's also mentioned that travel time and trip distance are provided through Tab. 1 and Tab. 2 for each simulation experiment.
