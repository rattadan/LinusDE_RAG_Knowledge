# User Analysis: cosmos

## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 5 keywords or tags for better postprocessing, based on the given data. First, I need to understand the content thoroughly.

Looking at the data, there's a lot of mentions of "Cosmos," "IBC Eureka," "DeFi," "new kind of DeFi," "built on the Cosmos Hub," and "tune in tomorrow." These terms are recurring. Also, there's a lot of talk about building the next generation of the internet, which ties into "vision of Cosmos." 

So the main themes here are Cosmos, IBC Eureka, DeFi, the future of internet, and maybe the project's goals. The user wants keywords that are distinctive. Let me see:

1. Cosmos: It's the main project name, so that's a solid tag.
2. IBC Eureka: Since it's the technology powering the DeFi, that's another key.
3. DeFi: It's the core of the content, so that's essential.
4. Future of Internet: The vision mentioned, which is part of the project's goal.
5. Next Generation: The phrase used to describe the internet's evolution, which ties into the vision.

Wait, but "Next Generation" might be too generic. Maybe "Innovation" or "Progress" could work. Alternatively, "Vision" is already there. Let me check if "Vision" is too broad. The original text mentions "the vision of Cosmos," so that's a good one. 

So the five tags could be: Cosmos, IBC Eureka, DeFi, Future of Internet, Vision. That covers the main points. I need to make sure they're distinct and relevant. Let me confirm again. Yes, these terms are all present in the content and capture the key aspects.

**Keywords/Tags:**  
1. **Cosmos**  
2. **IBC Eureka**  
3. **DeFi**  
4. **Future of Internet**  
5. **Vision**  

These tags highlight the project's core themes: its name, technology, core innovation, and long-term goals.
