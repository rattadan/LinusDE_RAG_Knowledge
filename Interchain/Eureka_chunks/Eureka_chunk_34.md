## Eureka - Chunk 34

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Solana), the Skip Go API will return an SvmTx type for the developer to pass to the user for signing
This doc is intended for CosmosSDK and EVM developers who aren’t already familiar with the concepts of transaction construction in the SVM and need to use SvmTx to help their users move from/to Solana and other SVM chains. Due to the difficult nature of including Solana transactions on chain during times of high network congestion, we HIGHLY recommend using the /submit endpoint to avoid dealing with complex retry logic and/or multiple RPC providers for submission reliability. Skip Go API’s /submit endpoint implements best practices for Solana transactions submission for you! ​
Interact with Solana Wallets
We recommend using @solana/wallet-adapter to interact with Solana wallets and build transactions. It provides a standardized Adapter object that wraps all major Solana wallets (e.g. Phantom, Backpack, etc…), as well as visual React components for wallet selection. See here for all the supported wallets.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Current Text Chunk:**

1. **Technical details and parameters:** The text chunk describes potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols (IBC, Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol, and Hyperlane), including specific technical terms like packet tracking, live relayer/client status, and timeout mechanisms. It also mentions the importance of implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.
2. **Context connection:** The text connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by providing additional insights into potential failure points and solutions for these protocols. This includes recommendations for user education, risk management, and developer best practices.
3. **Requirements, conditions, and constraints:**
   - Users need to be familiar with concepts like transaction construction in SVM (Solana) chains.
   - Due to network congestion, the text recommends using the /submit endpoint of the Skip Go API or interacting with Solana Wallets to avoid complex retry logic.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The current text chunk provides an overview of potential failure points and solutions for cross-chain asset transfer protocols in the context of Solana and other SVM chains.
* Users need to be aware of technical terms like packet tracking, live relayer/client status, and timeout mechanisms when interacting with these protocols.
* The recommendations provided aim to mitigate risks associated with high network congestion and provide best practices for building transactions.

**Focus on specific requirements:**

The text chunk focuses primarily on the technical details and parameters related to cross-chain asset transfer protocols. It also provides context and connections between the surrounding information, making it a valuable resource for developers and users working with these protocols.

However, there are some potential areas that could be expanded upon or clarified:

* The text assumes prior knowledge of Solana and other SVM chains. Adding a brief section on the basics of blockchain technology, transaction construction, or Solana-specific concepts could enhance the understanding of this information.
* While user education is mentioned as a key takeaway, it would be beneficial to include more specific guidance on how users can apply these recommendations in practice.

Overall, the current text chunk provides a solid foundation for developers and users working with cross-chain asset transfer protocols. By expanding upon the technical details and parameters discussed, this information could be further refined and made more accessible to a wider range of stakeholders.
