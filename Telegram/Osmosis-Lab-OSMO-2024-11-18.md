## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the key points. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions.

Looking at the messages, there are a few main topics. There's someone having issues with unstaking, another with bridging TON to a Telegram wallet, some technical problems with Keplr wallet on Osmosis, and a user having trouble with their Osmosis Pay card. Also, there's some positive sentiment about Osmosis and mentions of community discussions.

Starting with the unstaking problem: ronaldbrian77 says they can't unstake because it keeps failing. BasementNodes asks about the error, and kychuli mentions that reducing the unstaking period and relayers not updating clients might be the cause. So the key point here is unstaking issues linked to relayer problems.

Then, kagman14 is trying to bridge TON from Osmosis to Telegram wallet but can't find the option. kychuli suggests using the Orai Ton bridge and changing endpoints. The main takeaway here is the bridging process difficulty and the suggested solution.

Next, Youree69 and moonz_9 report network issues with Keplr on Osmosis, getting "Network request failed." kychuli advises checking endpoints and using a different network. So technical problems with wallet connectivity and the troubleshooting steps are important.

MengoZc has trouble withdrawing from Osmosis Pay card, even buying crypto is refused. Khuwarzmi tells them to connect their wallet and contact support. This points to issues with the payment card and support being a necessary step.

There's also some community discussion about Levana merging with Thorchain, possible integration, and building their own perps. Mmtrack brings up these points. The key here is the potential integration and Levana's market cap.

Ft79vop mentions bridging issues with Wormhole and using Noble Express. jasbanza explains it's gas-related on Solana. So bridging delays due to network traffic and gas fees.

The statbot message is about educational resources for Osmosis, which is a general info point. Also, cryptoprats asks why Osmosis is great, and Nostradamus411 lists reasons like the app chain thesis and Bitcoin alignment. Positive sentiment and community support are highlighted.

Other messages are general banter or stats, like the total

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring themes or subjects.

The idea of Osmosis building its own perpetuals (perp dex) comes up in conversations between Mmtrack and VexxVakan, referencing Levana's merger with Thorchain. This suggests topics around decentralized exchanges and future developments.

Technical issues with Keplr wallet, like network errors and using a VPN, are mentioned by Youree69 and moonz_9. They're talking about network request failures and changing endpoints, which relates to wallet connectivity problems.

There's also general community sentiment and support, with users like SlaymourCrypto and Nostradamus411 expressing optimism about Osmosis and the Cosmos ecosystem. Cryptoprats asks for a quick pitch on why Osmosis is great, indicating community engagement and educational content.

Support links and resources are provided by osmosis_statbot and mikebarb, pointing to official documentation and guides. Additionally, mentions of Cosmos app layer and integration with other projects like Kuji and Thorchain highlight ecosystem collaborations.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be staking/unstaking issues, IBC channel problems, bridging assets (especially TON and Solana), Osmosis Pay Card difficulties, discussions about building a native perp dex, Keplr wallet technical problems, community sentiment, educational resources, and ecosystem integrations.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot providing support links. That's neutral, just informational. Then Saeedivine mentions having WRX BEP2, which seems neutral too. 

Looking at kychuli's messages: they're giving advice on staking and bridging. The user BasementNodes asks about an error, and ronaldbrian77 says they can't unstake because it keeps failing. That's negative. Another user, moonz_9, is frustrated with network issues on Firefox, which is also negative. Kychuli suggests changing endpoints, which is helpful but the problem itself is negative.

Then there's a discussion about Levana merging with Thorchain. Mmtrack mentions it's a missed opportunity, which is a bit negative, but others like VexxVakan say the contract will keep working, which is more neutral or positive. 

Ft79vop and jasbanza talk about bridging issues taking a long time, which is negative. However, Ft79vop also thanks for redundancy and support, which is positive. 

SlaymourCrypto uses an emoji suggesting excitement, so positive. MengoZc has trouble with their Osmosis Pay card, multiple declines, which is definitely negative. They also mention Cypher Support isn't helpful, adding to the negative sentiment. 

The osmosis_statbot message again is neutral, providing educational links. Khuwarzmi and MengoZc have a conversation where the card isn't working, leading to frustration‚Äînegative. 

Other messages like "gud project" and Nostradamus411's comments about founders and the project's direction are positive. vta108 and lakidude mention catching up with OM and reasons for movement, which are positive. 

So, putting this together: there are several negative points about technical issues (staking, unstaking, network errors, card problems), some neutral messages (support links, questions), and positive comments praising the project, founders, and future potential. 

The challenge here is balancing the negatives and positives. The technical issues are recurring and multiple users report them, which could skew towards negative. However, there are also multiple positive statements, especially from users like Nostradamus41

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll need to go through each message carefully and identify any that indicate a task someone needs to do, a decision made, or a next step in a process.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's a resource, not an action item. Then Saeedivine mentions having WRX BEP2, which is just a statement. 

Looking at kychuli's message about staking and unstaking on Bostrom using a specific link. They tested it, so maybe others should try that link. Then BasementNodes asks for the error, which is a question but not an action item. ronaldbrian77 can't unstake and wants to know why. This is a problem statement but not an action item. 

BasementNodes mentions reducing the unstaking period and relayers not updating clients. This seems like a potential decision or next step related to network maintenance. Then kychuli says they haven't heard chatter, which is just a comment. Mmtrack talks about building their own perp dex, which is a suggestion but not a confirmed decision. 

VexxVakan mentions a contract continuing to work like an outpost. Not sure if that's an action item. Mmtrack asks what Osmosis will do, which is a question. kychuli again unsure about Bostrom issues. VexxVakan says Levana is merging with Thorchain, which is a decision or next step for Levana. 

ronaldbrian77 asks if staking is functional, another problem statement. Mmtrack suggests buying Levana and integrating it, which is a suggestion. kychuli provides a link to a Cyber DeFi status update. Then kychuli mentions Bostrom's IBC channels are expired and need governance fix. That's a next step for Bostrom to address via governance. 

kagman14 is trying to bridge TON to Telegram wallet. kychuli gives a link for the Orai Dex bridge, suggesting a method. Then kagman14 has issues with the bridge not allowing Telegram. kychuli explains using the Thesis link but notes it's not mobile-friendly. kagman14 asks about Keplr mobile,
