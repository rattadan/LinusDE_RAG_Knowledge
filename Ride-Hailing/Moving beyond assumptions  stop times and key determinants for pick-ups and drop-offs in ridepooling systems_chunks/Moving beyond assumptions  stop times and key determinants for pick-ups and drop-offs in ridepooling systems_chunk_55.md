**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the concept of Bus Dwell Time (BDT) in the context of ride-pooling services.

**Technical details:**

* The term "Bus Dwell Time" refers to the amount of time a bus spends sitting at a traffic light or other stop, waiting for the next traffic signal.
* The Journal of Public Transportation article analyzed BDT as an important factor in determining ride-pooling service efficiency and sustainability.

**Contextual connection:**

The text chunk is building upon the surrounding context by discussing various studies that have investigated the impact of bus dwell time on ride-pooling services. This includes references to research papers such as those from Tirachini (2013), Zwick et al. (2021), and Tikoudis et al. (2021). These studies highlight the potential benefits of optimizing BDT for better operational efficiency, which in turn can lead to improved sustainability outcomes.

**Requirements and conditions:**

* The text assumes a basic understanding of ride-pooling services, bus dwell time, and transportation systems.
* The references provided are academic papers that require access to specific databases or online platforms (e.g., IEEE ITSC conference paper).
* The text may not provide explicit guidance on how to conduct studies or implement simulations related to Bus Dwell Time.
