## DRT_Pricing - Chunk 23

**Document Summary:**

This paper discusses the development of a simulation model for dynamic transport services (such as shared autonomous vehicles) in Berlin using MATSim, an agent-based transport simulation framework. The key points are:

1. A multi-agent transport simulation scenario was developed based on the OpenBerlin data set.

2. It focuses on city-wide shared taxis as a mobility concept.

3. The model includes integration of various transportation modes (public transit, private cars, bicycles).

4. Key parameters examined include vehicle capacity, sharing level, and service area coverage.

5. The study investigates how these factors influence system performance metrics like passenger waiting times and travel speeds.

6. External cost pricing is proposed as a mechanism for optimal operation in an autonomous vehicle future.

7. Case studies were conducted using the model to analyze specific scenarios.

8. The model can be used to test different dynamic routing algorithms for on-demand transport services.

9. It provides a basis for evaluating welfare effects of shared autonomous vehicles at scale.

The authors suggest their approach could help inform policy decisions regarding future mobility systems in urban areas with emerging technologies like self-driving cars and ride-sharing fleets.

compared to the detailed simulation (every 10th iteration), depending on the total number of simulated DRT users (see
Fig. 1a). Also, as shown in Fig. 1b, there is no significant change in the mode shares before and after disabling the
speed up approach in iteration 350. The jump in iteration 400 is explained by switching off the innovative strategies
(disabling choice set generation). 2400.00
