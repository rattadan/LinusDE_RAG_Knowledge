## ICS - Chunk 27

**Document Summary:**

The development of Interchain Security (ICS) for the Cosmos ecosystem represents a significant milestone that paves the way for greater interoperability, security, and economic growth among blockchain networks. Here are some key points summarizing the current state and future outlook:

### Key Achievements:
1. **Replicated Security Launch:**
   - The first consumer chains have successfully launched with replicated security, sharing the validator set of the Cosmos Hub.
   - This model ensures that any attack on a consumer chain would impact the entire ecosystem as much as it would affect the Cosmos Hub itself.

2. **Opt-in Security Development:**
   - Informal Systems and other contributors are working to develop opt-in security, allowing validators to choose which chains they wish to secure independently.
   
3. **Subset Problem Resolution:**
   - The "subset problem" has been identified and is being addressed through the design of new governance proposals, like slash proposals, to mitigate potential attacks.

4. **Mesh Security Research:**
   - Ongoing research into mesh security aims to create a network of interdependent blockchains where validators can participate in multiple chains without compromising security.

### Upcoming Steps:
1. **Opt-in Security Implementation:**
   - Finalizing and deploying opt-in security will provide more flexibility for validators, allowing them to distribute their staked ATOM across different consumer zones.

2. **Mesh Security Design:**
   - Continuing the research and development of mesh security to ensure a robust and secure network of interconnected blockchains.
   
3. **Economic Zone Development:**
   - The ATOM Economic Zone is expected to bring innovative economic opportunities for its members, such as shared validator sets and enhanced inter-IBC functionalities.

4. **Interoperability Enhancements:**
   - Improving IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) functionality, including synchronous IBC, atomic IBC, and packet forwarding, to enhance user experience and security across the ecosystem.

### Long-term Vision:
1. **Sustainable Ecosystem Growth:**
   - By sharing the same validator set, consumer chains can benefit from increased security without needing their own validators, reducing costs and improving overall network resilience.
   
2. **Increased Adoption and Innovation:**
   - The interdependent nature of these blockchain networks is expected to drive innovation and adoption, as developers can leverage the combined strengths of multiple blockchains.

3. **Economic Opportunities:**
   - ATOM holders and validators will have more avenues for earning transaction fees and MEV (Miner Extracted Value) rewards across various zones.
   
### Conclusion:
The launch of Interchain Security marks a significant advancement in the interoperability landscape, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure blockchain ecosystem. As development continues, the Cosmos ecosystem is poised to offer new opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration among its members.

**Original Text:**

Consumer chains are blockchains operated by (a subset of) the validators of the provider chain. The ICS protocol ensures that consumer chains get information about which validators should validate on them. This information consists of the opted in validators and their power on the consumer chains. Note that the validators' power on the consumer chains is a function of their stake locked on the provider chain. Consumer chains are run on infrastructure (virtual or physical machines) distinct from the provider chain, have their own configurations and operating requirements. Consumer chains are free to choose how they wish to operate and which modules to include. For example, they can choose to use CosmWasm either in a permissioned or a permissionless way. Also, consumer chains are free to perform software upgrades at any time without impacting the provider chain. How to become a consumer chain? To become a consumer chain use this checklist and check the App integration section.
