**LLM Contextual Output:**

The article from IEEE Spectrum discusses Uber's potential to be the first company to test completely driverless cars in public. The authors note that several companies are already experimenting with autonomous vehicles, but most have not yet made their technology available for widespread use.

Uber is one of several startups and established companies exploring self-driving car technology, including Waymo (a subsidiary of Alphabet), Tesla, and Cruise (backed by General Motors). However, none of these projects have announced a plan to test completely driverless cars in public.

The article suggests that Uber's willingness to invest heavily in testing autonomous vehicles could be a key factor in its potential success. By partnering with industry experts, such as researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University, Uber may be able to develop more sophisticated and reliable self-driving technology before other companies can catch up.
