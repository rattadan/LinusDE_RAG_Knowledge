Ride-hailing vehicle ads
As part of our GTM strategy for the initial launch of the nRide application in the UK, we will leverage
our network of driving partners to reach our target market directly. Our driving partners will post in-car
flyers in the back of their vehicles to generate interest and drive downloads of the nRide application. These flyers will be designed to provide a clear value proposition, highlighting the unique benefits of the
nRide application. To ensure that our in-car flyers are effective, we will conduct extensive testing,
gathering feedback from drivers and riders. We will also track and analyze key metrics, such as
conversion rates and user engagement, to continuously improve the effectiveness of our advertising
efforts.
