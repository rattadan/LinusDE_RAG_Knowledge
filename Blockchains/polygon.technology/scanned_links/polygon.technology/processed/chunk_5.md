### Document Overview  
This content outlines Privado ID's role in enabling decentralized, privacy-preserving digital identity solutions, focusing on secure credential issuance, interoperability, and developer tools.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Privacy-preserving identity**: Decentralized, user-controlled identity systems that allow data sharing with consent.  
- **Verifiable credentials**: Cryptographically signed digital credentials (aligned with W3C standards) for proving claims.  
- **Issuer Node**: Self-hosted API for creating and managing credentials by trusted issuers (e.g., governments, banks).  
- **Wallet SDK**: Tools for developers to manage identity keys, credentials, and user data in decentralized wallets.  
- **Interoperability**: Support for cross-platform (Web3, blockchain, KYC) credential exchange via standardized protocols.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Credential Issuance**: Credentials are generated by **Issuers** (trusted entities) using **W3C standards** and **cryptographic signatures** to ensure tamper-proofness.  
- **User Workflow**: Users request credentials via an **identity wallet**, which stores their keys and credentials. The **Wallet SDK** enables developers to manage this data securely.  
- **Issuer Node**: A self-hosted API that allows issuers to issue credentials, integrating with blockchain networks for verification.  
- **Technical Specs**: Credentials are stored in **identity wallets** (e.g., Ethereum-based wallets), with the **Wallet SDK** providing APIs for key management and credential retrieval.  

### Related Topics  
- **Polygon Ecosystem**: Integration with Polygonâ€™s blockchain infrastructure for decentralized identity solutions.  
- **Web3 Interoperability**: Alignment with W3C standards for cross-platform credential exchange (e.g., KYC, oracles).  
- **Privacy and Decentralization**: Emphasis on user sovereignty, where users own and control their data, contrasting with centralized identity systems.

within a trusted ecosystem, providing their users with a secure, best-in-class experience.

A set of open-source software and infrastructure for developers to include privacy-first identity management features into their applications.

Create your own ecosystem of trust or interact with existing ones:Issue, hold or verify user credentials in an interoperable way thanksto the use of standards.

The Privado ID team supports developers and organizations building their own decentralized identity solutions.

Privado ID provides middleware infrastructure and tools for applications that implement privacy-preserving digital identity, empowering users to own their data and share it only with their consent. Developers can use Privado ID to enable the exchange of verifiable credentials secured by cryptography and the blockchain. Privado ID is designed for developers with a strong focus on privacy, decentralization and user data self-sovereignty.

Verifiable credentials are issued according to theW3C standardsand signed cryptographically to ensure they are tamper-proof. This is performed by Issuers, which are trusted organizations or companies. In the real world, this could include your government, university, or bank. In Web3, this could include KYC providers, oracles, DAOs, reputation services, etc.

For these Issuers, Privado ID includes the Issuer Node, a self hosted API capable of creating these credentials.

Credentials are not created in the void. They are created when a user requests them to prove something. The user then has to request, collect and store the credential. This is done through an identity wallet. In the same way a crypto wallet holds your crypto private keys, an identity wallet holds your identity keys and your credentials.

For these identity wallets (and for crypto wallets willing to expand to hold identity keys and credentials), Privado ID includes the Wallet SDK.
