**Original Text:**

Doing so is complex7, because the optimal design of a public transport network is an NPHard problem for many specifications, so one usually rests on some model-specific heuristics and simplifying assumptions (Borndörfer
et al., 2007; Fielbaum et al., 2018). On the other hand, integrating SMoD and public transport to create a unified transit network is a
challenging and promising idea, in which it would be natural to admit walks within the on-demand sub-system. CRediT authorship contribution statement
