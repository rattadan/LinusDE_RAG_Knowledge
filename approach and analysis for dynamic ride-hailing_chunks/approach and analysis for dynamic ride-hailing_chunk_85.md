I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

that it is important to not only consider the raw values from this
table but also to put them into perspective with the magnitude of
service rate and waiting time improvement from Table 3. Since every
additional request will naturally get more expensive the closer the
service rate gets to 100%, repositioning strategies with a big service
rate improvement tend to have higher additional costs per request. The same holds regarding waiting time minimization. Considering that
our undersupply probability strategy achieves the best service rate in
most settings, the respective costs are very competitive. In the two
settings with ùëáùëä = 1029, where our approach does not achieve the
best service rate, the repositioning costs of our strategy are just slightly
higher than for the nearest strategy. This shows that our approach
can explicitly consider the value of repositioning and prevent huge
costs when only a small profit is expected.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk provides technical details about dynamic dispatch and rebalancing strategies in ride-hailing systems.

1. The exact technical details described are:
- Service rate: A measure of how many requests can be fulfilled with one unit of time.
- Waiting time improvement: The reduction in waiting time for a request after repositioning or adjusting the fleet.
- Additional costs per request: The extra expenses associated with repositioning strategies beyond what is needed to achieve optimal service rates.
- Magnitude of service rate and waiting time improvement: The scale of improvements that can be expected from dynamic dispatch and rebalancing strategies.

2. This chunk connects to and builds upon the surrounding context by discussing:
- The importance of considering both raw values (service rate) and their perspective in evaluating repositioning strategies.
- The trade-offs between service rate improvement and waiting time minimization, highlighting that high service rates come with higher additional costs per request.
- The specific mention of undersupply probability strategy, which achieves the best service rate while minimizing additional costs.

3. Specific requirements or conditions mentioned include:
- A need to evaluate repositioning strategies explicitly, considering both their value and potential cost impacts on service rates and waiting times.
- The requirement for data that can be used to compare different strategies, specifically a dataset (Hailing Challenge) and references to previous work in simulation and modeling.
