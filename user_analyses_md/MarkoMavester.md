Putting this tweet in the context of intentions:
This tweet appears designed to gain attention by tagging multiple influential accounts in the crypto and business space. By saying "This is just the beginning" with a sparkle emoji, the author is trying to create intrigue and suggest they have insider knowledge about something significant coming. The lack of specific information makes it difficult to assess what they're referring to, but their intention seems to be to position themselves as someone important or knowledgeable in the crypto space without actually providing any substance. This could be part of a pattern to build credibility or interest in whatever "beginning" they're referencing, possibly related to a crypto project.
