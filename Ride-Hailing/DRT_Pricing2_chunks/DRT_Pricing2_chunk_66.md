## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 66

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

Because the waiting time for the customers usually
varies depending on the fleet utilization, we define different values
for 𝑇𝑊 for different 𝐷𝑆𝑅𝑠. To find reasonable values, we took the
50% and 90% quantiles of the customer waiting time for the 𝑉 =
100 fleet without the maximum waiting time constraint, resulting in
one very restrictive waiting time 𝑇𝑊1 and one less restrictive waiting
time 𝑇𝑊2 . For 𝐷𝑆𝑅 = 40, we use 𝑇𝑊1 = 103 s and 𝑇𝑊2 = 218 s,
and for 𝐷𝑆𝑅 ∈ {70, 100}, we use 𝑇𝑊1 = 271 s and 𝑇𝑊2 = 1029 s. For each problem configuration under consideration, the framework
simulates five different work days. When comparing different strategies

Please note that in both situations, vehicles that are available for
repositioning are removed from the supply before the start of the calculations. Because of that, it is not necessary to consider the reduction
in supply in a specific area when vehicles are sent to other areas.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

The current text chunk focuses on defining different waiting time values (𝑇𝑊) for various demand strategies (𝐷𝑆𝑅) in an autonomous ride-hailing system. The parameters defined are:

1.  Waiting time 𝑇𝑊: This is the average time a customer spends waiting for their ride. It's divided into two quantiles, the 50% and 90% values.
2.  Demand strategies (𝐷𝑆𝑅): These represent different levels of demand, ranging from the minimum (40) to the maximum allowed waiting time constraint (100). The specific waiting times 𝑇𝑊1 and 𝑇𝑊2 are calculated using these values.

**Context Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

This chunk connects to and builds upon the surrounding context in several ways:

1.  **Research Overview**: The text summarizes the key points from related research studies (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020), which explores autonomous taxis replacing private cars in urban areas.
2.  **Dynamic Optimization Models**: The text mentions various dynamic optimization models (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018) that have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals.
3.  **Machine Learning Techniques**: The text highlights the increasing use of machine learning techniques for solving problems like repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets.
