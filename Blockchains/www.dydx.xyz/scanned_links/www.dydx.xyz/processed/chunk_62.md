daily candlestick chart for Bitcoin (BTC), each candlestick is equivalent to 24 hours of BTC price fluctuations.
- Trading pair:This is a set of two assets that compare prices on a chart. Most often, crypto price charts pair a cryptocurrency with a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, for transparent price comparisons (e.g., a âBTC/USDâ pair quotes BTCâs prices in terms of U.S. dollars). However, traders can compare cryptocurrencies to other assets on their trading platform. For instance, a crypto trader may use a âBitcoin/Ethereum (ETH)â trading pair to visualize ETHâs relative value compared to BTC.
- Unit of time:Each price chart tracks crypto prices with different time durations on the horizontal axis. For example, if a price chart has an âhourlyâ setting, each candlestick represents one hour of trading data. Crypto trading platforms likedYdXlet traders adjust these time frames to see the data theyâre most interested in.
- Candlesticks:As mentioned, candlesticks are thin rectangles on a price chart that show price activity for a crypto asset within a selected time frame, such as an hour, a day, or a week. If a candlestick is green, its final price closes at the top of the rectangle, whereas red candles close at the bottom. Sometimes, these candlesticks also have straight white or gray lines on the top and bottom called âwicks.â A wick signifies how far a cryptoâs price trades within a given session but not where it opened or closed.
- Trading volume:Volume measures the total amount of a cryptocurrency traded for within a chartâs selected time frame. Traders find this data in a small bar graph below the central price chart. If a bar on the volume chart is green, there are more buyers than sellers for a cryptocurrency. Conversely, red bars mean more people sell cryptocurrency than buy it. The higher each bar is on a volume chart, the more activity there is in the crypto market.
