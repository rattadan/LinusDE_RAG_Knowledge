## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages from different users discussing various crypto topics.

First, I'll scan through each message. The earliest messages are about a Bitcoin address waking up after 12 years with 31 BTC, leading to discussions on holding crypto long-term. Users like bitconnnneeeect and fellew1 mention skepticism about Tap-to-earn and NFTs, suggesting buying trending categories like AI and crypto-casino tokens. USDCJesus talks about wait times, maybe 3 years, but not sure if that's related to the BTC story or something else.

Then there's a conversation between mikebarb and user_6897032164 about Osmo token and a project called Polaris. The user is skeptical about using OSMO to fund a project that doesn't benefit Osmosis, and mentions unstaking. They reference a Twitter Space with Helius and Celestia people. There's a link to a news article about Polaris Portal for cross-chain trading.

Other parts mention issues with IBC relayers on CUDOS and Osmosis, users having stuck transactions, and needing support. There's a question about what happens if a range price is under current price in liquidity pools, with kychuli explaining it goes out of range but not liquidated.

Also, some users discuss moving USDC from Ethereum to AKT via Thor, and whether Thor can do certain things. There's a partnership inquiry from Hecyljoymyfounder.

Key points to highlight: the long-term holding example with Bitcoin, skepticism about certain trends (Tap-to-earn, NFTs), preference for AI and crypto-casino tokens, the Polaris Portal announcement and community concerns about its value to OSMO holders, IBC relayer issues causing transaction problems, and the discussion on liquidity pool risks.

Decisions mentioned: user_6897032164 decides to unstake OSMO, fellew1 suggests buying trending coins, bitconnnneeeect thinks Tap-to-earn will fade, and there's a recommendation to join a Twitter Space for more info on Polaris.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, grouping similar topics and highlighting the main decisions and opinions without getting bogged

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the given text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I'll need to read through all the chat messages carefully to identify recurring themes or subjects.

Looking at the text, there are several mentions of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Words like "USDCJesus," "Thorchain," "OSMO," "Polaris," "CUDOS," "Celestia," "Helius," and "Osmosis" come up. These are specific projects or tokens, so they should be included as topics.

Next, there's a lot of discussion around moving or transferring assets between different blockchains. For example, "move usdc from ethereum to akt" and "IBC relayer issues." The term "IBC" (Inter-Blockchain Communication) is important here, so that's a topic. Also, "relayers" are mentioned multiple times, which relates to blockchain transactions.

Investment strategies are another theme. Users talk about "long-term holding," "buying several coins from every category," and "unstake." These terms relate to how people are managing their crypto investments, so topics like "long-term investment strategies" and "token purchasing strategies" make sense.

Wait times and patience are mentioned in a few messages, like "3 years of wait times" and "heroic patience skill." This seems to be about holding onto assets despite delays, so "wait times" and "holding assets" could be topics.

NFTs and trends: One user compares Tap-to-earn to NFTs, saying they'll be popular for a few years but then die. So "Tap-to-earn" and "NFT trends" are relevant topics.

Cross-chain trading and platforms: The Polaris Portal is mentioned as a tool for cross-chain token trading, so "cross-chain token trading" and "Polaris Portal" should be included.

Technical issues and support: There are messages about "stuck transactions," "timeout," "support tickets," and "RPC providers." These relate to problems users are facing and seeking help, so topics like "transaction issues" and "technical support" are important.

Community discussions and partnerships: The text includes "Twitter Space," "partnership proposal," and mentions of forums and support sites. This points to community engagement and collaboration efforts, so "community discussions" and "partnership proposals" are topics.

Lastly,

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- https (10 mentions)
- will (7 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages and wants to know the overall sentiment. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first message: "It would take 3 years of wait times tho." The user is talking about a long wait time, which sounds negative. Wait times usually aren't positive, so I'll mark that as negative.

Next, "I agree with you. AI and crypto-casino seems better for the long-term holding." The agreement and positive mention of AI and crypto-casino as better for long-term holding are positive. So positive here.

Then, "I don't think that Tap-to-earn is a long-term trend. It will be like with NFT - popular for a few years but dead after." The user is predicting Tap-to-earn will fade like NFTs, which is a negative outlook. Negative sentiment.

"I think purchasing several coins from every category is a good strategy. Tapping, artificial intellegence and crypto-casino tokens are now the most trending ones. Probably, buying some of them would be a good decision." The user is suggesting buying into trending areas, which is positive. Even though they mention some might be risky, the overall tone is optimistic about the strategy. Positive.

"I think this example demonstrates to us that it is cool to buy unknown and unpopular assets and keep them for decades. But the thing is that now there are too many of such crypto assets, too many coins." The first part is positive about holding assets, but the second part points out a problem with too many coins. So it's a mix, but since the user is highlighting a positive strategy but noting a current issue, maybe neutral? Or the negative aspect of too many coins might tip it to negative. Hmm, but the main point is about holding for decades, which is positive. Maybe positive with a caveat, but overall positive.

"Maybe the owner is already dead and it is his/her relatives who just found a written access to the wallet." This is speculative but not clearly positive or negative. Neutral.

"If he was waiting, that is the heroic patience skill. We all need to learn from that guy and hold for as much as possible." Heroic patience and encouraging holding is positive. Positive.

"A sleeping 12 year Bitcoin address just woke up and started to show activity. It has

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any explicit or implicit tasks, decisions made, or plans for the future.

Starting with the earliest messages. The user_6897032164 says, "After this I unstake üòÇ". That's a decision to unstake after some event. Then there's a message about contacting support for partnership proposals. Hecyljoymyfounder is asking whom to contact, so maybe the next step is reaching out to someone specific.

Looking at mikebarb's messages: he mentions contacting CUDOS about IBC relayer issues, and they're working on a fix. That's an action item for CUDOS devs. Also, he suggests joining a call tomorrow to get more info about Polaris, which is a next step for the user_6897032164.

Another part: the_helpful_fox_senko is asking for updates on a support ticket, so the action item here is to bump the ticket. Then there's a discussion about range price in liquidity pools and what happens if it's out of range. The response from kychuli indicates that users might need to adjust their positions, which could be a next step.

The message about purchasing coins from different categories (tapping, AI, crypto-casino) suggests a decision to diversify investments. Also, the mention of a Twitter Space event tomorrow with specific people implies attending that event as a next step.

I should also check for any other tasks like checking support sites, forums, or contacting specific individuals. For example, moonz_9 mentions that channels need more reliable relayers, which might be an action item for the team. The user profesija had a withdrawal issue and the response suggests waiting or escalating, so that's another action item.

I need to make sure not to include just opinions or general discussions unless they lead to a concrete action. For instance, the discussion about Tap-to-earn not being a long-term trend is more of an opinion, so unless there's a decision to avoid investing in that, it might not count. But the user fellew1's message about purchasing several coins is a decision.

Also, the message from mikebarb asking if Thor can move USDC from Ethereum to AK
