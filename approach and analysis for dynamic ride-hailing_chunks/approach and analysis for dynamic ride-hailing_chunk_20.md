**Original Text:**

(2018) solve
the sharing-variant of the problem by integrating information about
the sharability of trips. Fagnant and Kockelman (2014) do not perform
matching but assign gathered requests to the closest vehicles if they are
in the same zone. Requests without an available vehicle in their zone
receive a vehicle further away in subsequent steps. In Qin et al. (2020)
and Shi et al. (2020), the complete assignment strategy is learned via
reinforcement learning. Within the context of the repositioning approaches, Alonso-Mora
et al. (2017) suggest sending vehicles to locations of previously rejected requests. In Fagnant and Kockelman (2014), vehicles are shifted
between neighboring zones to balance supplyâ€“demand-ratios in these
zones. In Spieser et al. (2016), all available vehicles are distributed

3. Problem description
The aim of our study is to evaluate our own repositioning approach
as well as compare the quality of different solution approaches from the
literature for varying common problem characteristics.
