The tweets focus on how intelligence could be configured like software, and highlight other AI agents and tools that have real builds rather than just conceptual screenshots.

2. Language style and tone:
The language is technical but accessible, focusing on concepts like "agents," "memory," "plugins," and "tools" becoming "composable." The tone seems professional, informative, and slightly promotional. The use of "caught our eye" and "quick thread" suggests an attempt to cultivate a sense of community and shared interest in AI development.

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
The account appears legitimate in the sense that it's promoting a specific concept/platform related to AI agents. The website eliza.how seems to be a real domain. The account is sharing information about actual builds rather than just theoretical concepts, which adds to its technical credibility. It's also being retweeted by other accounts, suggesting some level of recognition in the field.

4. Ecosystem or project advertised:
The primary project being advertised appears to be "elizaOS" - an operating system or platform for AI agents. The tweets suggest this is part of a broader ecosystem that includes plugins, tools, and integrations with other platforms like Hyperfy.io and Bless Network as indicated by the retweets.
