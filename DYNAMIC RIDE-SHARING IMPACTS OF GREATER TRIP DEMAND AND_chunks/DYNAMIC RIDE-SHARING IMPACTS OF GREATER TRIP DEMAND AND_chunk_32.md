## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 32

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

However, higher stop spacing counteracts
some of the eVMT likely from using circuitous routes to get to a stop in light of queuing. Although the magnitude of difference in eVMT is 2 or 3 percent points, extrapolating this to
1.4M trips served under the 25x trip density sees considerable benefit in congestion mitigation. In other words, the fleet may have needed 2% or more VMT to satisfy these trips without use of
PUDOs provided at 0.25 mi. SAVs are able to serve more trips with a smaller impact on
congestion with DRS and the use of thoughtfully-sited PUDO zones. 9

Figure 3 Effect of Demand and Stops on Percent eVMT and AVO
The use of 0.25 mi-spaced stops increased total VMT savings by an additional 2% with current
Bloomington demand irrespective of spacing. This corresponded to about 15% to 23% savings in
SAV VMT even when mode shares are only 10%. Figure 4 shows total VMT and the
corresponding SAV VMT for the nine trip density and stop spacing scenarios.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section provides technical details on a process referred to as "eVMT" (Estimated Vehicle Miles Traveled) mitigation, specifically in relation to the use of lower stop spacings (1/8 mile or 0.25 miles) versus higher spacings (1 mile). Here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details:**

* eVMT is estimated vehicle miles traveled.
* The goal is to mitigate congestion and optimize routes for shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs).
* Lower stop spacings result in increased total VMT savings, with the specific benefit varying by scenario.
* Additional 2% or more VMT was required under higher stop spacing scenarios to meet demand.

**Context Connection:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Introducing the topic of eVMT mitigation and its purpose in optimizing routes for SAVs.
* Explaining that lower stop spacings result in increased total VMT savings, which can help mitigate congestion.
* Providing specific technical details on how to estimate eVMT using lower stop spacings.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

* The text assumes familiarity with the broader topic of shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance and its applications.
* It requires an understanding of demand and stops (a key variable in optimizing routes for SAVs).
* The text also assumes some knowledge of data visualization tools, such as Figure 3 and Figure 4.

Specifically, this chunk:

1. Requires the context of "shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance" to understand the topic.
2. Assumes a basic understanding of demand and stops (e.g., what they represent in optimizing routes).
3. Provides technical details on how to estimate eVMT using lower stop spacings.

Overall, this chunk provides technical information on a specific aspect of shared autonomous vehicles, which is then connected to the surrounding context by explaining its purpose and application.
