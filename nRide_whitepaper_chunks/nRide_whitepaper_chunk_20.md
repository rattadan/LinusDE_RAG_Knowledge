This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

•

Approve(A, secret_b) & T1(B)
Not possible because the smart contract does not allow Party A to approve unless Party
B’s account is funded. •

Approve(A, secret_b) & T2(B)
Party B sends their secret code to Party A, but for some reason, Party B did not cancel or
send an Approve message before T2. In this case, Party B is penalized a bit more than if
they had actively canceled because they made Party A wait for the expiry of the timeout. Party A receives 1.5 times their initial deposit, and Party B receives 0.5 times their initial
deposit. •

Cancel(A) & Approve(B, secret_a)
Symmetrical to output 2

•

Cancel(A) and Cancel(B)
Both parties actively cancel, but neither is able to submit the other’s secret code. Both
parties get penalized the same amount, and funds go to the treasury. Both parties receive

-80.5 times their initial deposit. •

Cancel(A) AND T1(B)
Party B never funded their account. After T1, Party A can withdraw their full deposit.
