## Eureka - Chunk 40

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

This allows smart contracts to execute expressive flows that may involve moving some amount of the user’s ERC-20 tokens
Skip Go will always return this field if there are any erc20 approvals needed for the route. It is the client’s responsibility to check if the user’s approval is already at or above the returned approval needed (for example, if the integrator allows for max approvals). If this field is non-empty and the user does not have the approvals necessary, the approval must be granted, signed, and submitted before the EvmTx populated by the other fields in the response can be submitted to the network. Otherwise, it will fail to execute with a permission error.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk provides technical details about potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols.

**Context:**

The text is part of an overview document on cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on five main protocols: Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast. The document aims to highlight potential risks and pitfalls associated with these protocols, allowing developers and users to better prepare for and mitigate those risks.

**Technical Details:**

1. **Timeouts and Slippage:** The chunk describes potential issues related to timeouts and slippage in cross-chain asset transfers, such as:
	* Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) timeout or slippage.
	* Post-swap failures, similar to IBC, where tokens may end up on the wrong chain.
2. **Multisig ISM:** The text explains the importance of a specific number of validators signing attestations for the success of transactions using Interchain Security Modules (ISMs), including:
	* Multisig ISM requirements and failure threshold.
	* Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.
3. **Timeout Mechanisms:** The chunk describes timeout mechanisms for preventing users from losing their funds, such as:
	* Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
	* Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

**Connections to or Building upon surrounding context:**

This chunk is connected to the overall context by:

1. Providing technical details about potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols.
2. Highlighting the importance of understanding these risks and implementing mitigations to prevent losses.
3. Offering recommendations for developers and users, including user education, risk management, and developer best practices.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

None explicitly mentioned in this text chunk. However, it is essential to consider the following:

* Ensuring robust error handling and fallback mechanisms are implemented in cross-chain applications.
* Educating users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
* Implementing user education and risk management strategies.

Overall, this chunk provides critical technical details about potential risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers, allowing developers and users to better prepare for and mitigate those risks.
