## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
This content provides technical details about the Ethereum blockchain's beacon chain state, including metrics like validator attestations, epoch boundaries, and network statistics, along with links to block explorers for data retrieval.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Aggregation bits**: Represents aggregated attestation of validators in the beacon chain.  
- **Beacon block root**: Points to the block where validators are attesting.  
- **Validators**: List of active and pending validators.  
- **Source**: Latest justified epoch (epoch boundary).  
- **Target**: Latest epoch boundary.  
- **Current epoch** and **Current slot**: Time-based metrics for the beacon chain.  
- **Active validators**: Number of validators currently active.  
- **Pending validators**: Number of validators waiting to be activated.  
- **Staked ETH**: Total ETH locked in the network.  
- **Average balance**: Average ETH balance of validators.  
- **Block explorers**: Tools (e.g., Etherscan, Blockchair) for fetching blockchain data.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Aggregation bits** are computed by validators and stored in the beacon block.  
- **Beacon block root** is determined by the Merkle root of aggregated attestation data.  
- **Source** and **Target** epochs are critical for validating attestations and determining validator eligibility.  
- **Current slot** and **epoch** are used to track the state of the beacon chain and validator participation.  
- **Staked ETH** and **average balance** are metrics used to assess validator reliability and network health.  
- **Validators** are grouped into **active** (eligible to attest) and **pending** (waiting to be activated).  

### Related Topics  
- **Block explorers** (e.g., Etherscan, Blockchair) are referenced for real-world data retrieval.  
- **Ethereum consensus mechanisms** (e.g., Proof of Stake, beacon chain) are implicitly tied to the described metrics.  
- **Validator incentives** (staked ETH, average balance) are connected to network security and governance.
