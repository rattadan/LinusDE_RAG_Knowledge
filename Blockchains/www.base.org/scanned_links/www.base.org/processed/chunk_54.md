balance of established infrastructure and emerging opportunities, and having Coinbase's brand behind it gives me real confidence. In an uncertain world, Base is a certainty I've come to rely on. What excites me most is how the ecosystem is mature enough to provide reliable development tools and support, yet still young enough that we builders can make a significant impact in shaping the future."

h3: What challenges have you experienced?

h3: "The 24/7 nature of crypto means staying on top of news and developments is a constant challenge while building a project. Being part of a small team of only three full-time devs, I often find it a struggle to balance development work with community engagement, market awareness, technical updates, and of course... the real world! I'm lucky that we have such a supportive community who help where they can. While my daily routine might look different from a traditional work schedule, I've embraced it. Coming from outside the crypto world, I've faced my share of challenges adapting, but when I compare my knowledge now to where I was a year ago, it's incredible to see how far I've come."

h3: What advice do you have to other builders?

h3: "I'll share my biggest piece of advice: do not stop building. I've learned that consistency and persistence are my greatest assets onchain. I would advise everyone to make sure to keep refining your project, learn from feedback, and continue to engage with your community - even during market downturns or when you encounter technical challenges. From my experience, the most successful projects aren't just built during the hype - they're built by people like me who remain dedicated to their vision while staying flexible enough to adapt to new opportunities. Creating Cat Town has opened doors I never could have imagined. Through Cat Town and our community we've been able to help support animal shelters and charities worldwide.
