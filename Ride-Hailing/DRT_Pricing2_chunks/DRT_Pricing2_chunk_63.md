## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 63

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

1 shows the temporal distribution of requests
over the course of the day. For every hour, the percentage of the daily
requests arriving in this hour is depicted. As in Kullman et al. (2021),
the planning horizon starts and ends at 2 a.m. to have the cut in times
of low demand. We generated ùêø = 300 uniformly distributed parking
lots for the area of roughly 59 km2 , leading to an average distance of
less than 300 m between any given point and its nearest parking lot. Since the main goal of this computational study is to analyze the
quality of the proposed strategies dependent on the given setting, key
influence factors need to be varied over the course of the experiments. We identified the following factors for which different values are used
in the study:

‚Ä¢ Whenever a vehicle reaches the null state and needs a parking
lot assignment, the best parking lot is determined by choosing
the one that leads to the maximum profit (expected missed reward minus travel costs).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk explains the technical details of dynamic trip-vehicle assignment in ride-hailing systems. Here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details:**

* The planning horizon starts and ends at 2 a.m. to account for low demand periods.
* The area is roughly 59 km^2, with approximately 300 uniformly distributed parking lots (ùêø = 300) spaced less than 300 m apart.
* Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment involves determining the best parking lot for each vehicle based on the maximum profit expected missed reward minus travel costs.

**Context:**

This chunk connects to and builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing a clear understanding of the research focus: The text explains that dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems, specifically in the context of autonomous taxis.
2. Reiterating the main goal of the study: The researchers aim to analyze the quality of proposed strategies under different settings and influence factors.

**Requirements and Conditions:**

* The study requires varying key influence factors (e.g., parking lot selection) over the course of experiments to assess their impact on dynamic trip-vehicle assignment.
* The planning horizon starts and ends at 2 a.m. to accommodate low demand periods, indicating that this is a specific time constraint.

Overall, this text chunk provides technical details on dynamic trip-vehicle assignment in ride-hailing systems, focusing on the planning horizon, parking lot selection, and the objective function (maximum profit).
