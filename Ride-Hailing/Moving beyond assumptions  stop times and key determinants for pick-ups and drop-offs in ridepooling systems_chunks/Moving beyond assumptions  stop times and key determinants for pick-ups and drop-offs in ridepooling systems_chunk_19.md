**Original Text:**

In addition to the existing PT bus stops, around 2,500 virtual stops were established in each service area, creating
a denser network of PUDO points. As a result, each customer should reach a PUDO location in not more than 150 m (GVH Hannover 2023). Booking a trip is facilitated through a
dedicated smartphone application, and phone booking is also possible. Passengers must

possible. The service is mainly performed with Mercedes-Benz Sprinters (Figure 2(b)), with additional Mercedes-Benz V-Class vehicles joining during peak demand. Both vehicle types offer
six passenger seats featuring electronically operated doors.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk appears to be explaining how a ride-pooling service is designed and implemented, focusing on the operational aspects of the system.

**Technical details:**
The chunk describes the design of virtual stops (PUDO points) in each service area, which are essentially designated points where customers can start or end their trips. The text mentions that around 2,500 virtual stops were established, creating a denser network of PUDO points compared to existing physical bus stops.

**Parameters and processes:**
The chunk highlights the operational parameters of the ride-pooling service, including:

1. Distance: Passengers can reach a PUDO location in not more than 150 meters.
2. Vehicle type: Customers must have a valid ticket before boarding the vehicle.
3. Ticket purchase: Ticket purchase from the driver is not possible.

**Connections to or building upon surrounding context:**
This chunk connects to and builds upon the surrounding context by providing detailed information about the operational aspects of the ride-pooling service, which includes:

1. **Urban transport systems:** The text mentions that the service aims to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions in urban areas.
2. **Simulation studies:** It references simulation tools like MATSim, used to model ride-pooling strategies and their operational aspects.
3. **Platform services:** The text highlights the company involved (Mercedes-Benz) as a key player in the ride-pooling service.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**
The chunk does not explicitly mention any specific requirements, conditions, or constraints, but it implies that:

1. The service aims to optimize operations and reduce travel times.
2. Advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles are being integrated into the system (e.g., Waymo's app).
3. The service is designed for peak demand periods, with additional vehicles joining during these times.

Overall, this chunk provides technical details about the operational aspects of a ride-pooling service, connecting to and building upon the surrounding context in urban transport systems.
