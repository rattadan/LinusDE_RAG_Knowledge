### Document Overview  
This content provides step-by-step instructions for sending Ethereum transactions, emphasizing network consistency, fee calculations, and wallet connection requirements.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Once confirmed, transactions cannot be canceled.  
- **Network Consistency**: Ensure sender and receiver use the same network (e.g., mainnet, testnet) for interoperable tokens.  
- **Transaction Fee**: Varies by network; wallets automatically add suggested fees.  
- **Wallet Connection**: Establish a secure connection via WalletConnect, which does not require ETH.  
- **Multi-Network Support**: Assets like DAI/USDC may require network-specific configurations.  
- **Fee Calculation**: Determined by network congestion and gas prices.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Steps for Sending**:  
  1. Open wallet → "Receive" → copy address.  
  2. Share address with recipient.  
  3. Ensure network alignment (e.g., same chain).  
  4. Use wallet to send, scan QR codes, or enter addresses.  
- **Fee Handling**: Wallets auto-add suggested fees; users confirm transaction.  
- **Network Selection**: Transfer tokens between networks requires explicit network selection (e.g., mainnet vs. testnet).  

### Related Topics  
- **Wallets**: Connected to the dApps page for app integration.  
- **Networks**: Covered in Ethereum.org’s network documentation.  
- **Token Interoperability**: Addressed in multi-network support for DAI/USDC.

```
the ID of the transaction.

No, once a transaction is confirmed, you cannot cancel the transaction.

- Open your wallet app.
- Click on "Receive" (or similarly worded option).
- Copy your Ethereum address to clipboard.
- Provide the sender with your receiving Ethereum address.
- Open your wallet app.
- Get the receiving address and make sure you are connected to the same network as the recipient.
- Enter the receiving address or scan a QR code with your camera so that you dont have to write the address manually.
- Click on a Send button in your wallet (or a similarly worded alternative).
- Many assets, like DAI or USDC, exist on multiple networks. When transferring crypto tokens, make sure that the recipient is using the same network as you are, since these are not interchangeable.
- Ensure that your wallet has sufficient ETH to cover the transaction fee, which varies depending on network conditions. Most wallets will automatically add the suggested fee to the transaction which you can then confirm.
- Once your transaction is processed, the corresponding crypto amount will show up in the recipients account. This might take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on how much the network is currently being used.
- Visit any projects website.
- If the project's landing page is just a static description of the project, you should be able to click on an "Open the App" button in the menu which will navigate you to the actual web app.
- Once you are in the app click on Connect.
- Select your wallet from the provided options list. If you can't see your wallet, it may be hidden under the WalletConnect option.
- Confirm the signature request in your wallet to establish the connection.Signing this message should not require spending any ETH.
- That's it! Start using the app. You can find some interesting projects on ourdApps page.
