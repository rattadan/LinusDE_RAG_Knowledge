## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. Alright, first, I'll go through each message to understand the context.

Starting from the latest messages and moving up. The first message from JohnnyWyles87 at 22:22 says that the issue with SOL/USDC pool liquidity might be due to people not wanting to hold Solana tokens on Osmosis because of pending corruption or that LPing wasn't attractive. So the key points here are about liquidity reduction reasons.

Then there's a support bot message from Osmosis. Hodlmastermeto at 21:48 is asking if the Picasso bridge issue is why there's less allSOL liquidity. They mention waiting for Picasso bridge to work again to reroute SOL.pica back to Solana and then via Wormhole to Osmosis. JohnnyWyles87 responds that the fix was buying out sol.pica and they're waiting for the bridge, in touch with Picasso team. Another message says Sol alloy is fixed now, all sol.pica removed.

Jam1988 is worried about a new proposal and asks if the fix was manual. JohnnyWyles87 says the contract adjustment will come in a future update, similar to a previous fix for static limits, but it's part of a bigger update, so some time away. Jam1988 also mentions a proposal to add a new SOL variant that can't be redeemed back, which might be problematic. Griffin_web3 shares links to tools and a proposal link.

Zzxzzzzzzjdk asks if the Picasso problem is solved. Oldi6 asks about plans for an upgrade and news from Osmosis. Then there are support bot messages and users having issues with a deposit stuck, transaction errors, and canceling orders. Jasbanza is helping someone with a canceled order, explaining errors, and directing to support. Oflyordieo is having trouble with a TFM transaction, checking Chainscope, and asking about a scam account. Kartoffelfren questions if an account is a scam.

Putting this all together, the main topics are the SOL/USDC pool liquidity issues due to bridge problems (Picasso bridge not working), the temporary fix of buying out sol.pica, plans for a future contract update, concerns about a new SOL variant proposal, and user support issues like stuck deposits and

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the main topics from this text. The user wants a comma-separated list, so I need to identify the key themes discussed here.

Looking at the messages, there's a lot about Osmosis, SOL/USDC pools, liquidity issues. JohnnyWyles87 mentions that the SOL alloy was fixed and removing sol.pica. There's also talk about bridges like Picasso and Wormhole, with users asking if the Picasso problem is solved. The corruption pending comment might relate to governance or security issues affecting liquidity.

Another part is about a new proposal adding a SOL variant that can't be redeemed back, which jam1988 is worried about because it affects the alloy's purpose. Then there are technical issues: users having trouble canceling orders, errors like "order not active, execute wasm contract failed," and questions about using Chainscope or the dev console. Also, some links to support sites and a mention of a scam account.

So main topics would be: Osmosis SOL/USDC pool liquidity, Picasso bridge functionality, Wormhole bridge, Alloyed pool adjustments, contract updates, new SOL variant proposal, order cancellation errors, Chainscope tool legitimacy, support resources, and potential scams. Need to make sure these are concise and cover all the key points without being too vague.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. So, the user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people discussing things related to Osmosis, Solana, Picasso bridge, Wormhole, and some contract issues. The main topic seems to be around liquidity problems in the SOL/USDC pool, specifically with allSOL and SOL.pica tokens.

First, I need to break down each message to understand the context. JohnnyWyles87 mentions that the corruption is still pending, which might have caused people to not want to hold SOL on Osmosis. They also talk about waiting for the Picasso bridge to become functional again to reroute tokens. The mention of "corruption" and "bricked" bridges sounds negative. 

Then there's a user asking about a stuck deposit and errors when trying to cancel an order, which indicates frustration or problems they're facing. Another user mentions a scam account and warns about scammers, which is definitely a negative point. However, there's also some positive feedback like "Awww yeah it works! Thanks a lot!" from oflyordieo, which is positive. 

The support bot keeps repeating the official support site link, which is neutral. Some users are seeking help, which shows they might be having issues (negative), but others are providing assistance, which could be seen as positive. The discussion about a new proposal to add a SOL variant that can't be redeemed back might be a concern, leading to a negative sentiment. 

There's also a mention of a contract fix being part of a future update, which is positive because they're planning a fix, but the fact that it's still pending might be negative. The overall tone seems to be a mix of frustration over current issues, some hope for future fixes, and a few positive interactions where help is provided. 

I should check for keywords: "bricked", "stuck", "error", "scam", "corruption" are negative. "Fixed now" is positive. "Waiting", "not operational" are negative. The sentiment might lean more negative because the majority of the messages are about problems and unresolved issues, with a few positive notes. But how to weigh them? The positive parts are solutions or fixes, but the main discussion is around ongoing problems. 

Also, the user jam1988 expresses worry about a new proposal and asks if there are plans for a fix, which shows concern

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see what's being discussed.

Starting from the top, JohnnyWyles87 mentions that the SOL/USDC pool liquidity wasn't impacted by something, but people might be avoiding holding SOL on Osmosis due to pending corruption or unattractive LPing. Not sure if there's an action item here yet. Maybe monitoring liquidity or addressing the reasons why people aren't providing liquidity.

Then there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing to the support site. That's just a standard link, maybe not an action item but a resource.

hodlmastermeto asks about reduced allSOL liquidity and speculates about waiting for the Picasso bridge. JohnnyWyles87 responds that the fix involved buying out sol.pica and waiting for the bridge to be operational again, in touch with Picasso team. So here, the action items could be "waiting for Picasso bridge to become operational" and "planning to route SOL.pica back to Solana via Wormhole". Also, they mention a bigger contract update is coming, so maybe "planning a future contract update with adjustments".

jam1988 asks if the fix was manual buying out of SOL.pica, which Johnny confirms. Then jam1988 questions if a new proposal to add a non-redeemable SOL variant should be on hold until a solution exists. Johnny says the contract adjustment will be part of a future update. So here, the action item might be "addressing the contract issue with a future update" and "monitoring the impact of the new proposal on bridgeability".

griffin_web3 and Brazer11 discuss bridges for EVM, suggesting Polaris and SquidRouter. So maybe "exploring alternative bridges like Polaris and SquidRouter for EVM" is a next step.

Looking at the other messages, there's a user with a stuck scrt deposit, so "investigating and resolving stuck scrt deposit issue" could be an action item. Then oflyordieo is having trouble canceling an order on TFM, and jasbanza provides a tool and suggests checking the dev console for errors. So "assisting oflyordieo with canceling the expired order using the provided tool" and "checking
