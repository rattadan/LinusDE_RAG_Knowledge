## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. First, I need to parse all the messages.

The first message from leonoorcosmos mentions a revised Validator Incentive Program finishing next week, on-chain reflection, 64 validators in 12 categories, 165 approved services, and new innovative tools. That's important because it's about program updates and structure.

Then there are several combot messages. One talks about the launch of Cosmos #Crew3, where users can join, fulfill quests, learn, rank up, and participate in giveaways and airdrops. Another mentions the Cosmos Weekly News, promoting various tokens. The Mars announcement on Osmosis and Pulsar Finance being highlighted as a community tool are also key points. There's a retweet about an Evmos community call with a different format.

Mrsarshivi's message is in Persian, providing steps to join a whitelist via Dragon Club Crew3, involving connecting wallets and Discord, completing tasks, retweeting, liking, replying, and using hashtags. Also, sharing a referral code for extra points.

I need to group these by topics. The main points are the Validator Program update, the Crew3 launch with its activities, the Mars and Pulsar announcements, the Evmos community call, and the Persian invitation details. The user probably wants to know what's happening in the Cosmos ecosystem, key initiatives, and how to participate in some of them.

I should make sure to mention the dates, the main projects involved, and the actions required for participation. Also, note the tokens mentioned. Avoid the URLs unless they're crucial, but the Crew3 invite link is part of the action steps. Check for any other important details like the number of validators, approved services, and the community-driven tools.

Wait, the Persian message is detailed steps for joining via Dragon Club, so that's an actionable item. The user might want that included as part of the key points. Also, the Mars project landing on Osmosis is a partnership or integration point.

Decisions here would be the launch of the new Validator Program, the Crew3 initiative, the Mars integration, promoting Pulsar Finance, the Evmos community call, and the whitelist process via Dragon Club. Need to present these clearly without the extra details, just the essentials.

Make sure the summary is structured,

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. The user gave me a series of tweets and a message in Persian. Let me start by going through each message one by one.

First message from leonoorcosmos on 2023-01-20T19:28:34+00:00: They mention the revised Validator Incentive Program will be finished next week and reflected on-chain. The sneak peek says 64 unique validators in 12 categories, 165 approved services with more to come, and some new innovative tools. So the action items here might be that the program is being finalized next week, and they're including new tools. Maybe the decision is finalizing the program and adding new tools.

Next, combot's tweet at 2023-01-20T18:39:39+00:00: It's about Cosmos Ecosystem launching Crew3. The next steps here are to join via the link, fulfill quests, learn, rank up. So action items would be joining the platform, completing quests, etc.

Then combot's message at 2023-01-20T17:06:01+00:00: They talk about the Cosmos Weekly News and encourage retweets. Action items here might be retweeting the news.

Another combot tweet at 2023-01-20T16:54:23+00:00: Mars is coming to Cosmos Ecosystem and Osmosis. Maybe the decision is partnering with Mars, but not sure if there's an action item here unless users need to do something specific.

Combot's message at 2023-01-20T16:14:29+00:00: Promoting Pulsar Finance. The action item is to try Pulsar Finance.

Combot's earlier tweet at 2023-01-20T11:22:57+00:00: Retweeting a thread about Evmos community call. So action item is retweeting that thread.
