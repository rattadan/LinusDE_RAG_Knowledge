## ICS - Chunk 17

**Document Summary:**

The development of Interchain Security (ICS) for the Cosmos ecosystem represents a significant milestone that paves the way for greater interoperability, security, and economic growth among blockchain networks. Here are some key points summarizing the current state and future outlook:

### Key Achievements:
1. **Replicated Security Launch:**
   - The first consumer chains have successfully launched with replicated security, sharing the validator set of the Cosmos Hub.
   - This model ensures that any attack on a consumer chain would impact the entire ecosystem as much as it would affect the Cosmos Hub itself.

2. **Opt-in Security Development:**
   - Informal Systems and other contributors are working to develop opt-in security, allowing validators to choose which chains they wish to secure independently.
   
3. **Subset Problem Resolution:**
   - The "subset problem" has been identified and is being addressed through the design of new governance proposals, like slash proposals, to mitigate potential attacks.

4. **Mesh Security Research:**
   - Ongoing research into mesh security aims to create a network of interdependent blockchains where validators can participate in multiple chains without compromising security.

### Upcoming Steps:
1. **Opt-in Security Implementation:**
   - Finalizing and deploying opt-in security will provide more flexibility for validators, allowing them to distribute their staked ATOM across different consumer zones.

2. **Mesh Security Design:**
   - Continuing the research and development of mesh security to ensure a robust and secure network of interconnected blockchains.
   
3. **Economic Zone Development:**
   - The ATOM Economic Zone is expected to bring innovative economic opportunities for its members, such as shared validator sets and enhanced inter-IBC functionalities.

4. **Interoperability Enhancements:**
   - Improving IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) functionality, including synchronous IBC, atomic IBC, and packet forwarding, to enhance user experience and security across the ecosystem.

### Long-term Vision:
1. **Sustainable Ecosystem Growth:**
   - By sharing the same validator set, consumer chains can benefit from increased security without needing their own validators, reducing costs and improving overall network resilience.
   
2. **Increased Adoption and Innovation:**
   - The interdependent nature of these blockchain networks is expected to drive innovation and adoption, as developers can leverage the combined strengths of multiple blockchains.

3. **Economic Opportunities:**
   - ATOM holders and validators will have more avenues for earning transaction fees and MEV (Miner Extracted Value) rewards across various zones.
   
### Conclusion:
The launch of Interchain Security marks a significant advancement in the interoperability landscape, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure blockchain ecosystem. As development continues, the Cosmos ecosystem is poised to offer new opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration among its members.

**Original Text:**

Here's a simple example of this problem: A new consumer chain is created, and several small Cosmos Hub validators start validating on the chain. Then, a large validator opts in. Depending on the powers involved, the large validator might have 66% of the power at this point and control the chain. It can then do anything, including emptying all the money out of the chain. In the cost to censor/control framing, the cost to control a consumer chain that not many validators have opted into can be low, even if the Cosmos Hub's overall cost to control is very high. Additionally, the attack is much easier to carry out than usual. To control 66% percent of a chain's stake normally would require buying it on the market, which is difficult to accomplish without the price spiking. With opt-in security, 66% of the stake could be seized instantly by a large validator opting into a small consumer chain. It is true that there are endless mechanisms one can think of to mitigate this issue.

**Analysis of the text chunk:**

1. **Technical details and parameters:** The technical details mentioned in this chunk include:
	* Replicated Security Launch, which involves sharing the validator set of the Cosmos Hub with consumer chains.
	* Opt-in Security Development, which allows validators to choose which chains they wish to secure independently.
	* Subset Problem Resolution, a design proposal aimed at mitigating potential attacks by creating a network of interdependent blockchains.
2. **Context connection and building upon:** This chunk connects to the surrounding context by explaining how Interchain Security (ICS) contributes to greater interoperability, security, and economic growth among blockchain networks within the Cosmos ecosystem. It builds upon this context by highlighting key achievements in ICS development, such as replicated security, opt-in security, and mesh security research.
3. **Requirements and conditions:**
	* The cost to control a consumer chain that not many validators have opted into can be low due to the high overall cost of controlling the Cosmos Hub.
	* The attack is easy to carry out compared to usual scenarios.
	* To mitigate this issue, opt-in security provides an alternative for large validators to seize 66% of the stake in small consumer chains.

**Specific requirements and conditions mentioned:**

1. High overall cost of controlling the Cosmos Hub
2. Low cost to control a consumer chain that not many validators have opted into
3. Easy attack possibility

This chunk explains how ICS contributes to improved security, economic growth, and interoperability within the Cosmos ecosystem, while also addressing potential concerns around the scalability and control costs associated with large validators opting into small consumer chains.
