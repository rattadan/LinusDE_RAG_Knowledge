The buy order is closed when the MACD histogram turns negative and is below the previous histogram bar. Sell Signal: Activated when Williams %R crosses below -6 and the price is below the 7-bar SMA. A sell order is placed if the MACD histogram shows a negative bar after a positive bar. The sell order is closed when the MACD histogram turns positive and is above the previous histogram bar. This strategy combines momentum (Williams %R), trend-following (MACD), and trend confirmation (SMA) to identify trading opportunities in the 1-minute timeframe. It is designed for short-term trading or scalping. Moving Averages, SMA, EMA, WMA: A Complete Guide for Traders Explained by Good Crypto
