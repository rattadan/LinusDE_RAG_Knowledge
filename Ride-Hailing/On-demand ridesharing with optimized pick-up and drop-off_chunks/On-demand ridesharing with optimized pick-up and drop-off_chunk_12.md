This reference list provides a comprehensive overview of current research trends and can serve as a basis for further analysis or application development in ridesharing technologies.

**Original Text:**

In this case, the coordination is implicit: nobody
agrees an exact point, but there are some streets (usually the large avenues) that idle taxis cruise more often so that passengers know
that it is easier to find a taxi quickly if walking there instead of waiting at their exact origin. Moreover, empirical studies show that
under high-demand conditions, traditional taxi street-hailing (that requires walking) might be more efficient than e-hailing (door-todoor) (Nie, 2017). How can walking enhance ridesharing systems? As discussed above, there are two main sources of improvement: prioritizing highspeed and highly-connected streets, and avoiding detours. The former is illustrated in Fig. 1, in which walking (bottom row) allows the
vehicle to stay in the main avenue, keeping away from three slow segments: going to pick-up the request and back, and the path from
the avenue to the requestâ€™s destination (top row).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes Described**

The current text chunk describes a scenario where taxis idle on streets that are typically used for walking. The primary goal is to improve ridesharing efficiency by facilitating easier taxi pickups for passengers.

1. **Street segments**: These include slow segments such as walking to pick up the request and back, and the path from the avenue to the request's destination.
2. **Walking (bottom row)**: This strategy prioritizes high-speed streets that are typically used for taxis and keeps them on the main avenue to avoid detours.
3. **Highly-connected streets**: These areas have many intersections or stops, making it easier for passengers to find a taxi quickly if they need one.

**Connections to or Building upon Surrounding Context**

The current text chunk builds upon existing knowledge about ridesharing systems and their challenges. It expands on the idea of using high-speed streets that are typically used by taxis as a primary method for facilitating easy pickups, while also discussing the benefits of avoiding detours and prioritizing highly-connected streets.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints**

1. **Demand**: High demand conditions are mentioned, which implies that ridesharing systems need to be optimized during peak hours.
2. **Traffic**: The text assumes a certain level of traffic congestion on main avenues, as walking taxis would not be able to navigate efficiently through congested areas.

Overall, this chunk provides practical insights into how taxi drivers can improve their efficiency by using high-speed streets and prioritizing highly-connected areas for pickups.
