## Source Context
*From: https://www.base.org/*

### Document Overview  
The content covers Ethereum blockchain fundamentals, development tools, deployment processes, and interaction with external platforms like Etherscan and Hardhat.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Decentralized ledger with smart contracts, gas, and a Turing-complete Virtual Machine (EVM).  
- **Web2 vs Web3**: Web2 focuses on centralized services (e.g., APIs), while Web3 emphasizes decentralized, permissionless networks (e.g., blockchain).  
- **Gas**: Fee for transaction processing on Ethereum, measured in wei, required to execute operations.  
- **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**: Runtime environment for executing smart contracts.  
- **Hardhat**: Declarative development framework for Ethereum, supporting TypeScript and deployment.  
- **TypeChain**: Tool for generating TypeScript interfaces and contracts from Solidity code.  
- **Forking**: Local network simulations for testing.  
- **Etherscan**: Platform for viewing transaction data, contracts, and network interactions.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Hardhat Setup**:  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat init
  npx hardhat setup --typescript
  ```  
  Creates a project with `hardhat.config.ts`, `contracts/`, `test/`, and `scripts/`.  
- **Gas Calculation**:  
  Gas is required to execute operations (e.g., `transfer`, `call`, `payable`).  
- **EVM Diagram**:  
  Shows the EVMâ€™s components (state, transactions, storage, etc.).  
- **Deployment Commands**:  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia
  npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <contract-address> <function-name>
  ```  
- **Etherscan Interactions**:  
  Use `ethers` library to read/write data (e.g., `readContract`, `writeContract`).  

### Related Topics  
- **Hardhat Forking**: Configures local networks for testing (e.g., `--network mainnet`).  
- **TypeChain**: Integrates with Hardhat for contract testing and interface generation.  
- **Etherscan**: Connected to Ethereum networks for contract verification and transaction data.  
- **Base Sepolia Testnet**: Used for deploying contracts with `hardhat-deploy`.
