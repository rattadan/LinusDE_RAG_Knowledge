Managerial Risks
Description

Mitigation

Timeline slippage: The project is composed of a few
workstreams (core, smart-contracts, UX) which need to be
coordinated carefully so as to be ready for integration and
testing towards month 10, leaving enough time at the end to
address the inevitable unforeseen issues. The Agile project management methodology with weekly
retrospectives and planning meetings enables the
management team to keep a firm grasp on the concurrent
progress of all workstreams. The roadmap is designed for the
hardest problems to be tackled first. This leaves room for
reprioritization if a major workblock is encountered with a
technical task.
