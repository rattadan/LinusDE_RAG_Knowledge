## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this chat text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The user provided a series of messages from different users on a Telegram channel related to Cosmos and Osmosis. 

First, I'll go through each message to identify important information. The first message from Arcmosis mentions Apollo-One ATH, which might be a project or token name. Then there's a CoinhallBot message with details about the Cosmos Airdrop Chat link, chain info, price data, and some stats like market cap.

Looking at other messages, Asa332 posts about Sunrise testnet ending on May 20th, 2025, and a Haru NFT snapshot. They also mention the Sunrise roadmap for June, including Community Round, Golden Egg NFT, Pre-deposit Campaign, and Mainnet Launch. That's a key point about project timelines and upcoming events.

Blockchainparty1 says the alt season will start next year (mid to late 2026) and tells people to take their ATOM off exchanges. Maybe a decision to move funds or a warning about exchange risks. Also, they mention Osmo airdrop, which could relate to the CoinhallBot's info.

SithLordx and MissRose_bot have reports, but those might not be key points unless there's a pattern. Kartoffelfren is suspicious of a potential scam, asking someone to explain publicly. That shows community skepticism.

There's a mention of a new campaign with zo.me by wlkatja, which is promotional. User_1185831195 asks if they can claim Atomone now, indicating a possible ongoing airdrop claim period. Unknown talks about the InterChain Summit in Berlin in June 2025, an event with speaker/sponsor applications. 

Blockchainparty1 again mentions taking ATOM off exchanges, which might be a repeated point. BasementNodes questions if Passage is still relevant, and AtlasStaking1 reminds about Passage and Initia airdrop claims closing on May 24th. So deadlines for airdrop claims are important.

Other messages seem like casual chat, jokes, or not directly relevant. The key elements here are the airdrop details (dates, projects involved), roadmap updates (Sunrise testnet end, mainnet launch), community actions (staking, moving funds off exchanges), upcoming events (InterChain

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or topics mentioned.

Starting with the first message from Arcmosis about "Apollo-One ATH" ‚Äì that's probably related to a cryptocurrency's all-time high. Then CoinhallBot's message includes details about a Cosmos Airdrop Chat, Osmosis chain, price data, and stats like market cap and supply. So topics here would be Cosmos Airdrop, Osmosis, price, market cap, circulating supply.

Looking at Blockchainparty1's messages: "Alt season will start next year" refers to alt season, and "Mid to late 2026" might be a timeline for something. Another message mentions "Osmo airdrop" again, reinforcing that topic. Also, "take your atom off the exchange" suggests discussions around ATOM token and exchanges.

Iconoicono's messages: "cosmos is always the last one" points to Cosmos ecosystem, and "try the universe" could be a reference to the Universe platform or ecosystem. There's also a YouTube link, but unless the video's title is relevant, maybe not a topic.

Kanemame introduces himself from Kopi-Money, so that's a community or group name. User_1185831195 asks about claiming Atomone, so Atomone is another token or project.

Asa332 has several messages about Sunrise testnet ending on May 20th, Haru NFT snapshot, and the roadmap including Mainnet launch, Golden Egg NFT, etc. These are specific projects and events within the Cosmos ecosystem.

MissRose_bot reports users, which might relate to moderation or security, but maybe not a main topic unless it's recurring. Kartoffelfren's messages about scams and explaining in DMs could indicate scam warnings or community safety.

Wlkatja mentions a new campaign with Zo.me and Warden Community, so partnerships or campaigns. Lf1980's comment about something happening before might not be a key topic unless context is clear.

Unknown's message about InterChain Summit Berlin 2025 in June is a major event. DiegoGanzala1's comment on claiming tokens in wallet already relates to token claims.

BasementNodes questions Passage

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from a group related to Cosmos and Osmosis, and they want to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with the top, Arcmosis mentions "Apollo-One ATH" but the time is in the future, 2025. Maybe they're excited about a new project? The CoinhallBot gives some stats on a token, prices are flat except a slight 0.03% gain over 7 days. Not much sentiment there, just data. 

Then there's Blockchainparty1 saying "Naw. Mid to late 2026" in response to something about alt season. They might be disagreeing, but not sure if negative. The next message from them is "I wish I never discovered Cosmos"‚Äîthat's definitely negative. Iconoicono says "cosmos is always the last one also ;P" which sounds a bit negative, maybe frustration but with a playful emoji. 

Blockchainparty1 again talks about alt season starting next year, which is neutral or positive depending on context. Iconoicono shares a YouTube link and says "try the universe"‚Äîprobably neutral or positive, maybe promoting something. User_5462303026 mentions market cap, just factual. 

MissRose_bot reports a user, SithLordx, who says "Shut up tard nobody wants atom"‚Äîclearly negative, offensive language. Another report from MissRose_bot, but the sentiment there is more about reporting abuse. Kartoffelfren is suspicious, asking someone to explain a scam in public, which is negative. 

Wlkatja announces a new campaign with Zo, positive emojis and links. Lf1980 says something happened a while back, neutral. Rcjulin_ForkDAO greets with positive emojis. User asking if they can claim AtomOne now, neutral inquiry. 

Unknown talks about an upcoming summit, neutral info. Privetandreynugdejeti shares links twice, maybe promoting something. DrKate_phmn shares a wallet link, neutral. Blockchainparty1 tells people to take Atom off exchanges, could be positive (advising security) or neutral. AtlasStaking1 shares airdrop info, neutral.

Putting this all together: There are some negative messages (Blockchainparty1's

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any tasks or important dates mentioned.

Starting from the top, there's a message about the Sunrise testnet ending on May 20th, 2025, and a snapshot for Haru NFT on May 21st. That seems like a key action item: participants need to ensure their Haru NFTs are equipped with desired items before the snapshot. I should note the dates and the action required.

Next, the user mentions the Sunrise roadmap for June, including Community Round, Golden Egg NFT, Pre-deposit Campaign, and Mainnet Launch. These are next steps for the project, so I'll list them as upcoming events.

Looking further down, there's a message from Blockchainparty1 advising to take ATOM off exchanges. That's a decision or action item for users holding ATOM. I should include that as a recommendation.

AtlasStaking1's message says Passage and Initia claims close on May 24th. Users need to claim before that date, so that's another action item with a deadline.

Then, the InterChain Summit Berlin in June has dates and times, plus a call for speakers and sponsors. Applying for those would be a next step for interested parties.

Other messages are either greetings, reports, or opinions without specific actions. For example, "try the universe" or "explain how you want to scam my money" don't have clear next steps unless more context is given, but here they seem like casual remarks. The price data and market cap info are just updates, not actions.

I should make sure not to include things like YouTube links unless they're part of an action item. Also, some messages are just reactions or jokes, which don't contribute to the required info.

So compiling all the relevant parts: the Sunrise testnet end date and snapshot, the June roadmap steps, the ATOM withdrawal advice, the airdrop claim deadline, and the summit details. Each of these has specific actions or dates to highlight. Need to present them clearly, maybe in bullet points, ensuring the dates and required actions are accurate. Double-check the dates and what each action entails to avoid mistakes.
