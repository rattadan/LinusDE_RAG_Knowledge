## Chunk 12

**Original Text:**

The actions of the pausing council are not time-locked to allow for a quick response time. â€‹
Governance stage (1)
After the protocol has successfully launched, the next step in the IBC Eureka roadmap is to allow general contract message passing between chains. This will enable canonical EVM Eureka deployments to be controlled by Cosmos Hub governance. As such, the security council will increase the minimum delay of the TimelockController to be longer than the time it takes to pass a governance proposal on the Cosmos Hub. This means that the security council will be much closer to becoming obsolete, while allowing the Cosmos Hub to override actions taken by the security council.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you're discussing a concept within the IBC Eureka (Inter-Blockchain Communication and Execution) project, specifically related to governance on the blockchain.

The mention of "TimelockController" suggests that this is a specific component or mechanism in the system being described. However, without more context about how it's supposed to work and what kind of interactions are envisioned between different chains in the IBC Eureka ecosystem, it's difficult to provide a precise explanation.

But based on your description, here are some observations:

1. **Increased delay for security council**: The idea that the minimum delay of the TimelockController is being increased to be longer than what's required to pass a governance proposal on Cosmos Hub suggests an attempt to make the security council's decisions (or lack thereof) more deliberative and slower.

2. **Allowing general contract message passing**: This implies that there's a mechanism in place for chains to communicate with each other directly, which could enable coordination or even coordinated actions among different blockchains. 

3. **Cosmos Hub override capabilities**: The mention of the Cosmos Hub being able to override actions taken by the security council suggests a potential level of decentralization and autonomy within the blockchain ecosystem.

4. **Potential for obsolescence**: This part seems more theoretical, as it implies that the current structure of governance might be about to change in favor of a new system or approach. However, without further context on how this would work or what specific changes are being contemplated, it's difficult to predict its impact.

5. **Technical feasibility**: The technical feasibility of these concepts is crucial. Ensuring that the IBC Eureka system can handle the proposed changes and maintain compatibility with existing blockchain technologies (like Cosmos Hub) would be essential for widespread adoption.

If you could provide more information about how this concept fits into the broader IBC Eureka project, including any relevant technical details or context, I might be better able to offer a clearer explanation.
