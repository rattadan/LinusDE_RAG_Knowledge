## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and identify the important information.

Starting with Rattadan's message: "Staking simulator is live..." That's a key point. It's probably a tool for users to simulate staking, so I should note that.

Then kanemame introduces themselves from Kopi-Money. Not sure if that's a decision or just a greeting. Maybe mention it as a new member introduction.

Asa332 has several messages. The first one is a link, maybe not important. The next ones talk about the Sunrise testnet ending on May 20th, 2025, and a Haru NFT snapshot on May 21st. They also mention the roadmap for June including Community Round, Golden Egg NFT, Pre-deposit Campaign, and Mainnet Launch. These are all important deadlines and upcoming events, so definitely key points.

wlkatja announces a new campaign with zo.me, instructing to join the Warden Community on Zo. That's a campaign with instructions, so a key decision or action item.

rcjulin_ForkDAO's message is a greeting, probably not important.

Unknown's message about the InterChain Summit Berlin 2025 on June 20-21 with specific times and an after-party. Also, a link to apply as speaker/sponsor. This event info is key.

privetandreynugdejeti has two duplicate links, maybe promoting something related to POSTHUMAN_DVS. Not sure what, but since they're duplicates, maybe it's important to mention the promotion.

drKate_phmn shares a link about Keplr Wallet. The link's content might be important, but without context, maybe just note that a wallet update or announcement was shared.

Now, I need to structure this concisely. Group similar points. For example, Sunrise testnet end date and snapshot are related. Roadmap items in June are separate. Campaigns with zo.me and POSTHUMAN_DVS links. Events like InterChain Summit. Also, the staking simulator and wallet announcement.

Make sure to mention dates, actions required (like equipping Haru before snapshot), and the mainnet launch. Avoid greetings unless they're part of an introduction that's relevant. Check for any decisions that need to be made by

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key points.

Starting with Rattadan's message about the staking simulator going live. That seems like a main topic related to staking tools. Then kanemame mentions being from Kopi-Money and a greeting, but the main topic here is Kopi-Money introducing themselves.

Asa332 has a link to a Cosmos Ecosystem tweet, which might be about the ecosystem. Then another Asa332 message about the Sunrise testnet ending on May 20th and the Haru NFT snapshot. So that's two topics: Sunrise testnet end date and Haru NFT snapshot. Also, the link to the testnet app is part of that.

Another Asa332 message talks about the Sunrise roadmap in June: Community Round, Golden Egg NFT, Pre-deposit Campaign, and Mainnet Launch & TGE. Each of these could be separate topics, but maybe grouped under Sunrise roadmap.

wlkatja mentions a new campaign with zo.me, joining Warden Community on Zo, and a link to their tweet. So the main topics here are Warden Protocol's campaign and the Zo platform.

rcjulin_ForkDAO's message is a greeting to the Cosmos community. Maybe not a main topic, but if there's a recurring theme, perhaps Cosmos community interactions.

Unknown's message is about the InterChain Summit Berlin 2025, dates, after-party, and the website. So that's an event topic.

Privetandreynugdejeti has two identical links to a POSTHUMAN_DVS tweet. The content might be about their project, but since the link is the same, maybe just one mention of POSTHUMAN_DVS's Twitter post.

drKate_phmn shares a link to Keplr Wallet's tweet. So Keplr Wallet's Twitter post is another topic.

Now, compiling all these topics. Need to make sure they're distinct and not repeated. The Haru NFT Snapshot and Sunrise testnet end date are separate. The Sunrise roadmap items are listed as individual points. The campaigns (Warden and zo.me), events (InterChain Summit), and the other Twitter links. Also, Kopi-Money introduction and ForkDAO's greeting. Wait, but maybe the greeting

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start by reading each one carefully.

The first message is from Rattadan: "Staking simulator is live..." That sounds like an announcement of a new feature or tool. Words like "live" usually indicate something positive because it's a successful launch. So I'd say positive here.

Next, kanemame says, "I'm from Kopi-Money, nice to meet you all!" The phrase "nice to meet you" is friendly and welcoming, which is definitely positive. The user is introducing themselves in a friendly manner, so positive.

Then kanemame again: "Hey everyone üëã" Just a greeting. It's neutral because there's no strong emotion or opinion expressed. Emojis like a wave can be friendly, but without context, it's probably safe to mark this as neutral.

Asa332 shares a link to a Cosmos Ecosystem tweet. The link itself doesn't have text, but the username might be neutral unless the link's context is known. Since I can't access the link, maybe it's neutral. But wait, the previous messages from Asa332 are about Sunrise testnet ending and their roadmap. Those include words like "officially end" but also mention future events. The end of a testnet could be seen as a step forward, so maybe neutral because it's factual. The roadmap mentions "Mainnet Launch & TGE" which is positive, but the message itself is listing events without clear sentiment. Hmm, maybe neutral for both messages.

Wlkatja: "New Campaign! ‚ù§Ô∏è" The heart emoji and exclamation mark show enthusiasm. Campaign launches are usually positive, so positive.

Rcjulin_ForkDAO: "Good morning all the cosmos ü©¥üßâü´°üí°" The emojis here are sandals, coconut, salute, and lightbulb. It's a greeting with friendly emojis. Positive because it's cheerful and engaging.

Unknown user about InterChain Summit Berlin 2025. It's an event announcement with dates and details. The user is sharing information without clear sentiment. Neutral, unless the mention of an after-party until 2 AM adds some positive vibe. But overall, it's more informational, so neutral.

Privetandreynugdejeti posts the same link twice.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. Let me go through each message one by one.

First, Rattadan's message says the staking simulator is live. Not sure if that's an action item or just an announcement. Maybe no action needed here, just info.

Kanemame from Kopi-Money introduces themselves. That's a greeting, probably no action item.

Asa332 shares a link to a Cosmos Ecosystem tweet. The previous message mentions the Sunrise testnet ending on May 20th and a Haru NFT snapshot on May 21st. The user needs to ensure their Haru is equipped with desired items before the 20th. That's a next step: participants should prepare their Haru NFTs by May 20th.

Another message from Asa332 about the Sunrise roadmap in June: Community Round, Golden Egg NFT, Pre-deposit Campaign, Mainnet Launch. These are upcoming events but not immediate actions unless there's something to do now. Maybe just info, but the Pre-deposit Campaign might require preparation, so perhaps note that as a future step.

Wlkatja announces a new campaign with Zo. Users need to join the Warden Community on Zo and check the tweet for instructions. Action item here is to join Zo and follow instructions.

Unknown mentions the InterChain Summit Berlin on June 20-21. They should apply as a speaker/sponsor if interested. So next step is applying before slots fill up.

Privetandreynugdejeti shares a POSTHUMAN_DVS tweet link. Not sure what's in the tweet, but the message itself is just a link. Maybe no action unless the tweet has specific instructions, but since it's not provided, I'll skip that.

DrKate_phmn shares a Keplr wallet tweet link. Again, without the content, not sure if there's an action item. Probably just sharing info.

So compiling the action items: Prepare Haru NFTs by May 20th, join Zo campaign for Warden, apply for speaker/sponsor at InterChain Summit. Also, note the Sunrise roadmap steps in June, but maybe those are future steps. The testnet ending is a deadline, so that's important. The user might need to check the links for more details on the campaigns.
