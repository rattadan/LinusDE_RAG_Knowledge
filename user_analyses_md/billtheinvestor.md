Putting these tweets in context of the author's intentions:
The author seems to be sharing their personal experiences as a retail cryptocurrency investor, expressing frustration with the challenges of trading crypto markets effectively. They acknowledge that most of the time trading crypto is unprofitable and only a small percentage of time yields profits. They follow market trends closely, particularly Ethereum, and appear to have significant positions in crypto/NFTs that they're trying to recoup losses on. Their tweets suggest they're not necessarily trying to promote crypto investments to others, but rather sharing their own struggles, skepticism about market fairness, and moments of hope when prices move in their favor.

The tweets show a pattern of someone who:
- Is emotionally invested in crypto markets
- Has experienced significant losses
- Understands the risks involved in crypto trading
- Is trying to find ways to succeed in these markets
- Is skeptical about market manipulation and fairness
- Uses humor to cope with the stress of trading

1. #CryptoMarketCommentary
2. #RetailInvestorPerspective
3. #EthereumPriceAction
4. #MarketVolatility
5. #NFTMarket

Let me refine these based on the distinctive patterns in the content:
1. #CryptoStruggles - This captures the repeated theme of having difficulty making profits in crypto
2. #EthereumFOMO - The tweets about Ethereum often express frustration at missing opportunities
3. #MarketManipulationConcerns - The author frequently references skepticism about "dogÂ∫Ñ" (market manipulators)
4. #RetailCryptoTrader - The perspective clearly comes from a retail trader rather than an institutional player

I think these capture the most distinctive patterns in the content.
