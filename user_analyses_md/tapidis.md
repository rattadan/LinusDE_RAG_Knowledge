## Overview

<think>
I'll analyze this tweet/message according to the requested categories:

1. Main topics/themes discussed:
The message is about sharing social links to be included in an Excel document. It relates to the Cosmos Ecosystem project, with the author identifying himself as "mr Tom head admin of smartnodes." The main theme is administrative coordination within a blockchain/cryptocurrency ecosystem.

2. Language style and tone:
- Casual and informal ("Hello everyone", "i am mr Tom", "Where can I sent you")
- Contains grammatical errors ("sent" should be "send")
- Direct and straightforward communication
- Uses an emoji (the star)
- Has a somewhat urgent or time-sensitive feel ("sented" instead of more formal language)

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
There are some concerns about legitimacy:
- The message contains grammatical errors ("sent" instead of "send")
- The username "mr Tom" with lowercase "m" in "mr" is unusual for a professional context
- The phrase "head admin" sounds somewhat informal for an official position
- The message asks where to send links rather than providing official channels
- The message appears in the Cosmos Ecosystem channel but has a suspicious quality that might suggest impersonation

4. Ecosystem or project advertised:
The message references "smartnodes" and appears in the "Cosmos Ecosystem" channel. Cosmos is a blockchain ecosystem that connects different distributed ledgers through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. SmartNodes likely refers to a project within or related to this ecosystem.

5. Evaluation of the author's character:
- Personality traits: Direct, informal, possibly lacking attention to detail (based on the grammatical error)
- Motivations: Trying to coordinate information sharing (social links) for what they claim is a project within the Cosmos Ecosystem
- Emotional patterns: Neutral, professional but with casual tone
- Decision-making approach: Straightforward, asking for a specific direction without elaboration
- List of discussed topics: Social links sharing, Excel document
- Interacted users: The message is a reply to another user's message with ID 14235, but we don't have the content of that original message to understand the context of the interaction

Additional observations:
- The message appears to be from an admin claiming to represent a project in the Cosmos ecosystem
- The casual tone and grammatical errors seem inconsistent with what might be expected from an official representative
- The message seems to be looking for guidance on where to share social links, suggesting the author is trying to contribute information but may not be authentic

Now I'll create a concise summary and append 5 matching keywords/tags.
