### Document Overview  
The document outlines steps for setting up and customizing documentation environments, including local development, previewing changes, and leveraging features like code blocks, images, global settings, and reusable snippets.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Code Blocks**: Markdown syntax for writing code in documentation.  
- **Images and Embeds**: Support for embedding images and external content.  
- **Global Settings**: Configuration options for document styling and branding.
