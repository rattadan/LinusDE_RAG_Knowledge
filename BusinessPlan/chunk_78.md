Other Technical Risks
Description

Mitigation

NKN outage. nRide relies on NKN, a decentralised overlay
network, to enable p2p communication between mobile
devices. Most mobile devices do not have a public IP address
on which to expose a server necessary for bilateral p2p
communication. NKN is a blockchain-powered network of
computers that share their networking resources to provide
data transmission and connectivity to connected users. An
outage or failure at this layer would disable all

NKN is a public blockchain running on open source software.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The text describes the risks associated with the NKN outage, specifically in relation to mobile devices that do not have a public IP address for server exposure. Here are other technical risks and mitigation strategies:

**Other Technical Risks:**

1. **Malware and Vulnerabilities**: Mobile devices may be vulnerable to malware or exploits that could compromise their security and disrupt p2p communication.
2. **Network Congestion**: An overload of p2p traffic on NKN's blockchain network could lead to congestion, slowing down the entire system.
3. **Scalability Issues**: As the user base grows, the scalability of NKN may be compromised, leading to increased latency and reduced performance.
4. **Security Breaches**: The decentralized nature of NKN makes it vulnerable to security breaches if not properly secured.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Implement Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and address them before they can be exploited.
2. **Use Secure Protocols**: Use secure protocols such as TLS or SSH to encrypt data transmission between devices and NKN servers.
3. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Monitor network traffic in real-time to detect any signs of congestion or malicious activity.
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on p2p communication to prevent overload and reduce latency.
5. **Develop a Disaster Recovery Plan**: Develop a disaster recovery plan to ensure that the system can recover from outages and failures, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.
6. **Collaborate with Developers**: Collaborate with developers to stay up-to-date with the latest security patches and best practices for NKN development.

By acknowledging these technical risks and implementing mitigation strategies, nRide can minimize the impact of an outage or failure on its users and ensure a secure and reliable p2p communication experience.
