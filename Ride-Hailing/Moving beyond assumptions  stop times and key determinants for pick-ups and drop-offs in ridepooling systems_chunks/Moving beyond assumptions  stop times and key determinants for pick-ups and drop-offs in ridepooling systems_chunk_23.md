**Original Text:**

Stops at which
a passenger did not appear at the PUDO location, referred to as ‘no-shows’, were filtered
out. In addition, we removed excessive outliers from the dataset. Data analysis
Descriptive statistics
Analysing stop time data, we applied descriptive statistical methods including mean,
median, and standard deviation (STD). Additionally, we tested the data for normal distribution using the one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test. Our analysis encompassed a
variety of factors influencing PUDO events, such as service areas, times of day, vehicle types,
stop locations, boarding versus alighting stops, the number of passengers, passenger age
groups, and the presence of bulky luggage. Regression model
Following the methodology proposed by Sun et al. (2014), we developed distinct regression
models for boarding and alighting, with the independent variables in Table 2.
