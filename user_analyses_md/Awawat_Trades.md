Some context can be gleaned from:

* Pierre Crypt0's tweet about NFT gaming on the blockchain, which suggests an interest in this emerging space.

* The trader's claims of having achieved significant trading success ("I told you so"), which could be seen as a way to build credibility and attract followers.
