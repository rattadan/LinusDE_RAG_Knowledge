**Original Text:**

2018), indicating a general overestimation
compared to the median stop time of 21 s that we found based on our data. Comparing our ridepooling stop times with the ridesourcing study by Ranjbari et al. (2021) conducted in Seattle, we noticed that pick-up stops in the Hanover region are slightly
faster (Hanover: 29.5 s; Seattle: 35 s), while drop-offs are slower (Hanover: 18 s; Seattle: 11 s). Consequently, the dispersion between boarding and alighting is less pronounced in our
case but remains statistically significant. Moreover, their 90th percentile for pick-up stops,
at 281 s, is substantially higher than in our data (185 s). This discrepancy can be attributed
to operational differences between ridesourcing and ridepooling. In ridesourcing, it is common for drivers to wait at a stop location for the customer, a practice not typically part of
ridepooling operations (Kucharski et al. 2021).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the comparison between ride-pooling and ridesharing services in terms of their operational efficiency, specifically focusing on pick-up stops.

**Technical details and parameters:**

* The reference to "median stop time" (21 s) likely refers to a measure of average or middle value for stop times at various locations.
* The mention of comparison with the "ridesourcing study by Ranjbari et al. (2021)" indicates that the authors are referencing a specific study on ridesourcing, which is an alternative mode of transportation that involves waiting at stops before picking up customers.

**Processes and connections to surrounding context:**

* The text builds upon the discussion of ride-pooling vs. ridesharing in previous sections, providing further details on operational differences between these two modes.
* This comparison is relevant to understanding the sustainability impacts of shared mobility services, as mentioned in the introduction to the document.
* The mention of pick-up stops and their duration (e.g., 29.5 s and 281 s) suggests that this analysis is part of a broader research effort examining the operational efficiency of ride-pooling services.

**Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

* There are no specific technical parameters or calculations mentioned in this chunk.
* However, it's worth noting that the comparison between ride-pooling and ridesharing is based on data from Seattle (Hanover region) and may not be representative of all urban areas.
