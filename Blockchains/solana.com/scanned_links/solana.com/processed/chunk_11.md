### Document Overview  
This content explains the structure of Solana transactions, including how program instructions are executed, account keys, transaction headers, and the role of address tables in dynamic account loading.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Program Instructions**: A list of sequential instructions executed in a single atomic transaction.  
- **Account Keys**: Base-58 encoded public keys for accounts, used to identify which accounts participate in a transaction.  
- **Transaction Headers**: Contain metadata like required signatures, account types, and read-only account counts.  
- **Address Table Lookups**: Dynamic loading of accounts from on-chain tables using indices.  
- **Writable/Readonly Indexes**: Specify which accounts are writable or read-only, limiting transaction capabilities.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Transaction Structure**:  
  - `instructions`: Array of program instructions (e.g., `lifetimes.instructions`).  
  - `programIdIndex`: Index into `accountKeys` to specify the program executing the instruction.  
  - `accounts`: Array of indices into `accountKeys` to determine which accounts are involved.  
  - `data`: Base-58 encoded input data for the transaction.  
  - `addressTableLookups`: Array of lookup tables used to dynamically load accounts (e.g., `accountKey` values).  
- **Header Fields**:  
  - `numRequiredSignatures`: Total number of signatures required for transaction validity.  
  - `numReadonlySignedAccounts`: Number of read-only accounts signed by the transaction.  
- **PoH Entry**: Transactions targeting the same read-write account are evaluated sequentially within a PoH entry.  

### Related Topics  
- **Account Types**: The `header` field specifies account types (read-only, read-write) and their constraints.  
- **Signature Requirements**: The first `numRequiredSignatures` keys in `accountKeys` must sign the transaction.  
- **Address Table Lookup**: The `addressTableLookups` array is used to dynamically load accounts from on-chain tables, as described in Solanaâ€™s address table documentation.

Programs may process multiple transactions that load read-only accounts
within a single PoH entry, but are not permitted to credit or debit
lamports or modify account data. Transactions targeting the same
read-write account are evaluated sequentially.
