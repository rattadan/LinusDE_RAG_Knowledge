Putting the tweets into bigger context of the author's intentions:
The author appears to be primarily interested in promoting certain cryptocurrencies (particularly $MOLLY) while simultaneously expressing disdain for the broader crypto community. Their aggressive tone and focus on "parabolic pumps" suggests they are more interested in quick gains rather than the underlying technology or long-term value of crypto projects. The retweet of $MOLLY along with the reference to "parabolic pumps" indicates they might be trying to build hype around this token, possibly to benefit from price movements. Their language style is designed to provoke reactions and stand out in a crowded crypto space, rather than provide thoughtful analysis.
