## Chunk 13

**Original Text:**

As such, the security council will increase the minimum delay of the TimelockController to be longer than the time it takes to pass a governance proposal on the Cosmos Hub. This means that the security council will be much closer to becoming obsolete, while allowing the Cosmos Hub to override actions taken by the security council. ​
Pausing stage (2)
After a trial period of allowing the Cosmos Hub to govern the canonical Eureka deployments, the security council will revoke its’ rights and controls over canonical deployments, fully allowing the Cosmos Hub to take over its’ responsibilities. Token & Route Support Requirements
This document describes the steps you must complete for the Skip Go API to begin providing new routes for users to transfer a token over to various remote chains using IBC. ​
Background
New tokens often want Skip Go API to add support for transferring their token to other chains because the API powers cross-chain swaps + transfers in all the major cosmos wallets (Leap, Keplr, IBC Wallet, Metamask Snap) and cross-chain DEX aggregation for many popular defi aggregator and dapp frontends (e.g.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you've provided a passage discussing potential updates to the security council's role within the Cosmos Hub and its impact on decentralization.

To summarize:

1. The security council is increasing the minimum delay for TimelockController, which could make it less effective in enforcing rules.
2. This might lead to the security council being rendered obsolete while allowing the Cosmos Hub to assume control over governance proposals.
3. During a trial period, the security council will revoke its rights and take back responsibility for canonical deployments.

Regarding the Skip Go API:

1. It seems that this API is designed to facilitate transferring tokens across various remote chains using Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).
2. The document outlines steps for completing this process, which involves integrating with the Skip Go API.
