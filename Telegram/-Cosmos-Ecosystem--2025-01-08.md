## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages, mostly from different users discussing BeeZee DEX, Cosmos SDK, CosmWasm, and some project updates.

First, I need to identify the main topics. The main discussions are about whether CosmWasm is needed for the target chain, how projects can be listed on BeeZee DEX, the permissionless nature of market creation, and some mentions of AI bot Linus_nRide. There's also a part about AnubisPhy's progress and KYVE's growth, but maybe those are less central to the key points.

Looking at the key messages: faneatiku mentions that CosmWasm isn't enabled yet on their chain and they don't know if it will be soon. So the first point is that CosmWasm isn't required for listing projects. Then, projects on other Cosmos SDK chains with IBC can be listed now, and they'll help with fees. Also, factory tokens like SHERPA and SPICE can be sent to their chain.

Another key point is the market creation being permissionless by summer, but currently needing some requirements for the frontend. The user unknown asks about CW20 tokens, and faneatiku says they can't support them if they require CosmWasm. So that's a decision point: CW20 tokens aren't supported yet because CosmWasm isn't enabled.

There's also a discussion about scheduling a call via Calendly, but faneatiku hasn't updated theirs. Then, the AI bot Linus is being discussed as a helper for the Cosmos ecosystem, with plans to update its database with nRIDE. The community wants the bot to focus on the current topic and mention projects in the channel's topic.

I should structure the summary around these points: CosmWasm status, project listing requirements, permissionless markets timeline, CW20 token support, and the AI bot's role and updates. Also note the assistance with fees and the need for Calendly updates.

Need to make sure it's concise, so bullet points or a short paragraph. Avoid the less relevant parts like the AnubisPhy stats and KYVE's tweet unless they relate to decisions. Probably not necessary here. Focus on the BeeZee DEX, Cosmos SDK, CosmWasm

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand the structure of the text. It looks like a series of chat messages with timestamps and usernames. Each message is separated by lines of dashes.

I'll start by reading through each message to identify recurring themes or topics. The first message from faneatiku asks about whether CosmWasm is needed on the target chain. CosmWasm comes up again in other messages, so that's definitely a key topic. 

Next, crypto_back_up mentions the "best airdrop project of 2024," so airdrop projects are another topic. Then there's a message about scheduling a call and using Calendly, which relates to scheduling or coordination. 

Another message from faneatiku talks about listing projects on a Cosmos SDK chain with IBC enabled, so Cosmos SDK and IBC are relevant. The BeeZee DEX is mentioned multiple times in questions about how projects can be listed, market creation fees, and permissionless markets. That's a significant topic here.

There's also a mention of factory tokens like SHERPA and SPICE being sent to the chain, so token transfers or factory tokens could be a topic. The discussion about when CosmWasm will be enabled points to the status of CosmWasm implementation as a topic.

AnubisPhy's message is about their community growth, followers, and gratitude, which might be considered as community engagement or project updates. PaulBMS mentions KYVE's growth, so another project update or ecosystem growth topic.

The user also asks about Linus_nRide_Assistant_Bot's knowledge of $ATOM and recommendations, which relates to the ATOM token and staking. There's a conversation about improving Linus to support the Cosmos ecosystem, which could be AI assistance or bot development.

Additionally, there are several URLs shared, but since the user wants topics, not links, I might not include those unless they're part of a broader topic like social media promotion or specific project mentions.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be:

- CosmWasm implementation status
- Airdrop projects (2024)
- Scheduling coordination (Calendly)
- Listing projects on BeeZee DEX
- Cosmos SDK chain with IBC
- Market

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- will (10 mentions)
- can (9 mentions)
- our (8 mentions)
- about (7 mentions)
- projects (6 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The user provided a list of chat messages, so I'll start from the top and work my way down.

The first message from faneatiku asks if CosmWasm isn't needed on the target chain. That seems like a straightforward question without clear sentiment. Maybe neutral? Unless there's an implied frustration, but I don't see that here.

Next, crypto_back_up says "best airdrop project of 2024". The word "best" is definitely positive. So that's a positive message.

Then, unknown messages about DMing, which is just a statement of intent. Neutral.

faneatiku's question about availability is neutral. The message about Calendly not being updated might indicate a problem, so maybe slightly negative. But it's a statement, not overly emotional.

The message from faneatiku explaining that projects on Cosmos SDK chains can be listed now, and they'll help with fees. The tone here seems positive because they're offering assistance and stating capabilities.

Another unknown message about factory tokens being sent, referencing specific tokens. Neutral since it's factual.

The message where faneatiku says CosmWasm isn't enabled yet and unsure about enabling it. This could be neutral or slightly negative if they're facing limitations, but it's more informational.

faneatiku tells a bot not to answer unless tagged. Neutral instruction.

The message about not having CosmWasm and CW20 tokens requiring it. Again, stating a fact, so neutral.

faneatiku mentions market creation will be permissionless by summer, but working on it. Positive because they're planning improvements.

Another message about market creation being permissionless but with requirements. Neutral.

Unknown asks for a call and Calendly. Neutral.

Unknown asks if CW20 tokens can be added. Neutral.

Unknown tags faneatiku asking about listing projects on BeeZee DEX. The message is a question seeking information, so neutral.

Retweeted message with a link. Since it's a retweet, no sentiment unless the context is negative, but here it's just sharing, so neutral.

AnubisPhy's message is quite poetic, thanking the community and mentioning growth. Words like "cherished treasure", "support", and "pledge" indicate positive sentiment

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see what's relevant.

Starting with the latest messages. Faneatiku at 2025-01-08T23:26:55 asks if CosmWasm is needed on the target chain. The previous message from crypto_back_up is a positive comment about an airdrop project, which might not be an action item. Then unknown says they'll DM faneatiku. Faneatiku asks about availability and mentions their Calendly isn't updated. So, possible action items here: update Calendly and schedule a call.

Looking at faneatiku's message about projects on Cosmos SDK chains with IBC enabled being able to list now, and offering help with market creation fees. That's a decision or next step: assist projects in listing on their chain without CosmWasm. Another message says factory tokens can be sent, like SHERPA and SPICE. So maybe the next step is to facilitate those tokens.

Faneatiku mentions CosmWasm isn't enabled yet and unsure when it will be. So no action there, just a statement. They also say market creation is permissionless but need other requirements for the frontend. So next step might be working on those requirements.

Unknown asks if they can add CW20 tokens. Faneatiku's response about not having CosmWasm implies that CW20 tokens can't be added yet, but maybe future consideration. Not an immediate action.

The user asks how projects can list on BeeZee DEX, whether they need pool requests, and mentions wanting to increase pairs for OTC trading. Faneatiku's reply indicates he'll help with listing projects, so the action item is assisting in the listing process.

AnubisPhy's message is a retweet and a poetic update about their progress, but not sure if there's an action item here. Maybe just a status update.

PaulBMS retweets KYVE's growth. Again, a status update.

Faneatiku tells the bot not to answer for two hours unless tagged. So that's a decision to pause the bot's responses.

Other messages mention improving Linus bot by feeding it medium articles and updating its database with nRIDE. So action items
