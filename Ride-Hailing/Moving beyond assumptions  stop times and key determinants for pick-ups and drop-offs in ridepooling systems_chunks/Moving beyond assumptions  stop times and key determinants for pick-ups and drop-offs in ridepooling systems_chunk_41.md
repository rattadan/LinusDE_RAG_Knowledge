**Original Text:**

We identified a significant difference of 64% in stop times required
for boarding compared to alighting. Allocating stop times based on the direction of dwell
would substantially improve the accuracy of future ridepooling studies; a practice that has
already been proposed for conventional PT systems for several years (Dueker et al. 2004;
Sun et al. 2014), but has yet to be integrated in DRT investigations. The reviewed DRT literature typically relies on fixed and deterministic assumptions for general stop times, failing
to distinguish between boarding and alighting. Many studies assume stop times of 30 s

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**
The provided text chunk describes the exact technical details and parameters used in a simulation study to model ride-pooling strategies, specifically focusing on stop times and operational aspects of shared mobility systems.

- The difference in stop times required for boarding versus alighting (64%) is calculated using data from various studies.
- Stop times are typically assumed to be 30 seconds (D. HARMANN ET AL., Stueger, Fehn, and Bogenberger, 2022; Zwick et al., 2021; 2020) or 60 seconds (Bischoff, Maciejewski, and Nagel, 2017; Engelhardt et al., 2019; Harmann et al., 2023b; Hörl and Zwick, 2021; Kagerbauer et al., 2021; Kagho et al., 2021; Salman et al., 2023; Stiglic et al.).

**Context Connection and Building:**
This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by providing technical details on simulation studies used to model ride-pooling strategies. The text connects this information to the broader discussion of urban transport systems, sustainability, and technological aspects of shared mobility services.

- The reference to fixed and deterministic assumptions in existing literature for general stop times (Dueker et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2014) serves as a starting point for understanding the limitations and gaps in previous studies.
- The discussion on stop times ranging from 30 seconds to more than 60 seconds, along with the mention of advanced simulation tools like MATSim (mentioned in multiple references), highlights the importance of considering real-world operational factors when designing ride-pooling systems.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**
There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk. The text appears to provide general information on technical details and parameters used in simulation studies related to ride-pooling services, without any particular context that would necessitate additional constraints or conditions.
