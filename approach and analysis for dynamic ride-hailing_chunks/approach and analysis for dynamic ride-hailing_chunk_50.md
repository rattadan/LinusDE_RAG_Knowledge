I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

An improved version
to overcome this issue can be found, e.g., in De Souza et al. (2020)
and Wallar et al. (2018). They use the same idea, but stop the repositioning when the absolute supply per zone equals the absolute expected
demand. In De Souza et al. (2020), a matching problem is built to
ensure that the actual supply in each zone is at least as big as a specified
minimum supply while minimizing the travel time for repositioning. The minimum supply is calculated based on the expected demand for
each zone. To ensure feasibility in times of undersupply, they scale
the minimum supply linearly down from the expected demand until
a feasible solution for the problem can be found. We implemented a slightly different version of this global matchingbased strategy. In a first step, the supply per zone is determined. Here,
all vehicles that are either idling in this zone or have the destination
of their last scheduled job in this zone are counted.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section provides technical details on a dynamic dispatch and repositioning algorithm for ride-hailing systems.

1. The exact technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk:
   - Dynamic dispatch: A strategy to allocate vehicles to different zones based on the demand.
   - Repositioning: The process of moving vehicles from one zone to another to optimize supply and demand balance.
   - Minimum supply calculation: To determine when to stop repositioning by scaling down the minimum supply until a feasible solution is found.

2. How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:
   - The section builds upon previous work on dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems, including references like De Souza et al. (2020) and Wallar et al. (2018).
   - It provides a specific implementation of one approach for repositioning vehicles in demand-balanced zones.

3. Any specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:
   - The algorithm is designed to handle undersupply situations by scaling down the minimum supply until a feasible solution can be found.
   - The approach uses a matching problem as a basis, ensuring that the actual supply in each zone is at least as big as a specified minimum supply while minimizing travel time for repositioning.
