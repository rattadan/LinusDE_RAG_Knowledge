This suggests the author sees themselves as both a provider of trading signals and a promoter of crypto ecosystem growth.

From the consistent format of posts focusing on specific trading trends, and the integration with the AssetDash app, it appears the author wants to establish a brand identity around providing actionable market intelligence in the crypto space.
