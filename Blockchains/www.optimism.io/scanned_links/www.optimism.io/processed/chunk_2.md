### Document Overview  
This content outlines Optimism's governance model, emphasizing a non-plutocratic system with a two-house structure, on-chain voting, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding to support community-driven innovation.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Non-plutocratic governance**: A model avoiding centralized control, prioritizing community input and transparency.  
- **Two-house system**: A dual governance model (e.g., technical and economic oversight) to balance innovation and stability.  
- **On-chain voting**: Decisions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring trust through transparency and immutability.  
- **Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)**: Rewards for projects that create positive societal impact, funded retroactively after implementation.  

### Implementation Details  
- The **two-house system** separates governance responsibilities: one for technology (e.g., sequencer operations) and another for economics (e.g., resource allocation).  
- **On-chain voting** uses blockchain-based mechanisms to ensure accountability and prevent fraud.  
- **RetroPGF** incentivizes projects by rewarding contributors after their impact is verified, fostering long-term community engagement.  
- The **Optimism Foundation** oversees the Collective’s growth, aligning with Ethereum’s principles of sustainability and public good.  

### Related Topics  
- The document connects to the **Vision** section, highlighting Optimism’s goals for scalability and societal impact.  
- It references partnerships with organizations like **Base**, **OP Labs**, and **Zora Labs** to expand the Collective’s reach.  
- The **Optimism Foundation** is explicitly mentioned as a key entity driving governance and funding strategies.
