I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

1 shows the temporal distribution of requests
over the course of the day. For every hour, the percentage of the daily
requests arriving in this hour is depicted. As in Kullman et al. (2021),
the planning horizon starts and ends at 2 a.m. to have the cut in times
of low demand. We generated ùêø = 300 uniformly distributed parking
lots for the area of roughly 59 km2 , leading to an average distance of
less than 300 m between any given point and its nearest parking lot. Since the main goal of this computational study is to analyze the
quality of the proposed strategies dependent on the given setting, key
influence factors need to be varied over the course of the experiments. We identified the following factors for which different values are used
in the study:

‚Ä¢ Whenever a vehicle reaches the null state and needs a parking
lot assignment, the best parking lot is determined by choosing
the one that leads to the maximum profit (expected missed reward minus travel costs).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the specific section in question:

1. **Technical details:**
The exact technical details mentioned are:
- Uniformly distributed parking lots for an area of roughly 59 km2 with an average distance between points and nearest parking lot less than 300 m.
- Simulation parameters include a planning horizon of 2 hours starting at 2 a.m.

2. **Contextual connection and building upon surrounding context:**
The chunk connects to the surrounding context by discussing real-world ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on simulation platforms (e.g., DIMACS Center for Discrete Mathematics: Hailing challenge), demand forecasting, dynamic dispatch, rebalancing strategies, and mathematical models.

3. **Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**
- The emphasis on the planning horizon starting and ending at 2 a.m. to account for low-demand times.
- The use of uniformly distributed parking lots with an average distance less than 300 m between points and nearest parking lot.
- Identifying factors that influence parking lot assignment (e.g., best parking lot chosen by maximizing profit, expected missed reward minus travel costs).

This chunk appears to be a technical section explaining the simulation setup for the ride-hailing system analysis. It discusses the parameters used in the study, including the planning horizon and mathematical models of demand forecasting, dynamic dispatch, and rebalancing strategies.
