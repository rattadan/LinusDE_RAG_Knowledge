This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

Additionally, the escrow smart-contract is configured with two timeouts:
T1

After the first deposit is paid into the escrow account, party B has T1 time to send their deposit,
after which party A will get their deposit back. T1 is left to the discretion of the first party to
create and instantiate the contract. However, T1 is intended to be relatively short, only a few
minutes after the agreement is initially formed and the first party engages with the contract (i.e. sending tokens to the contract). -7T2

T2 is a longer timeout that triggers a default action in case either of the parties fails to submit a
message to the smart contract after both deposits have been paid. T2 is intended to cover the
time it would take to complete the pickup and is left to the discretion of the first party that creates the escrow. 3.2.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk appears to be explaining the technical details and parameters of an escrow smart contract used in a decentralized ride-hailing platform, nRide.

**Technical Details:**

1. The escrow mechanism is designed with two timeouts:
   - **T1**: A short timeout (a few minutes) that allows parties B and A to send their deposits to the contract after initial agreement is formed.
   - **T2**: A longer timeout (3.2 seconds) that triggers a default action in case either party fails to submit a message to the smart contract.

**Connectivity to Surrounding Context:**

The current text chunk builds upon the surrounding context by highlighting the escrow mechanism's connection to nRide's mission, key technologies, platform components, and goals. This provides additional insight into how the escrow mechanism fits into the broader picture of nRide's development roadmap.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this text chunk that I am aware of.
