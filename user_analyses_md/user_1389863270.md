## Overview

<think>
I need to analyze these tweets from the "Cosmos Airdrop Chat" channel. Let me go through each of the tweets one by one:

Tweet 1036539: "Many of my old trackers are stuck in precambrian era of airdrops"
- The author is referring to their "trackers" (likely tools or methods for tracking cryptocurrency airdrops)
- They're saying these trackers are outdated, using the metaphor of the "precambrian era" which implies extremely old or primitive
- This suggests a discussion about the evolution or changes in airdrop tracking methods

Tweet 1036538: "Guys which sites are still updating the airdrops?"
- The author is asking the community for recommendations on websites that are still actively updating airdrop information
- This suggests concern about finding reliable, current information about cryptocurrency airdrops
- The casual "Guys" suggests this is directed to fellow community members

Tweet 1036537: "Which means you're a dinosaur" (with edit information)
- The author is responding to someone else's message (replying to msg_id 1036525 which isn't visible here)
- They're using a playful metaphor comparing someone to a dinosaur because their trackers are outdated
- The tweet was edited almost immediately after posting (from 14:34:57 to edited at 14:35:35)
