By describing himself in the third person, the author creates a sort of personal brand identity that they're promoting to the people they're interacting with. The mention of hating "rugs or scams" is particularly relevant in the crypto/web3 space where these types of frauds are unfortunately common, suggesting the author wants to distance himself from those negative practices while establishing trust with potential community members.
