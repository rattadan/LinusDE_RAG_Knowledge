## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 69

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

In addition to the main
experiments, we also study the influence of minor factors like the
temporal and spatial request distribution, the number of parking lots,
and the necessity of quick responses. specification, the best strategy per setting (row) is shown in italic
typeface. In addition, we compare the results of the two specifications
all/non-serving vehicles to determine which strategy is best when vehicle
availability is part of the strategy. In this comparison, the absolute best
strategy per setting is given in bold typeface. The results show that the nearest strategy outperforms the matching
approaches for fleets with low utilization (ùê∑ùëÜùëÖ = 40). This is caused by
the decision-delay of the matching approaches. Due to the assignment
interval ùõøùëÄ , actions are not taken immediately. In low-utilized fleets,
the benefit of the matching is lower than the time lost waiting for
the next matching epoch. This problem further increases with longer
matching intervals.
