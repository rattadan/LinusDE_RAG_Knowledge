**Context of intentions**: The account seems to be cultivating an image as a "crypto sage" who can identify market turning points and quality projects. By claiming early BTC success and predicting altcoin movements, he positions himself as having unique insight. His emphasis on "utility season" and revenue-generating projects suggests he's trying to differentiate between speculative activity and projects with sustainable value. The tweet "I’m making it all back without doing anything" suggests he's promoting a hold/accumulation strategy rather than active trading. The reference to leaving after being right on alts indicates he may monetize his influence through exit liquidity.
