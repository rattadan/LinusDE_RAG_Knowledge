Putting some tweets in bigger context of intentions:
The tweets about high-value Punk sales and market commentary seem to establish credibility and demonstrate deep knowledge of the NFT space. The sarcastic comment about not taking "super dummy rich" crypto people seriously if they don't own a Punk serves to reinforce the author's belief in the importance of Punks within the NFT ecosystem. Their self-deprecating humor about forgetting how much they spent suggests they're an active participant rather than just an observer. The tweet about Taproot Wizards rising above mint price appears to be genuine celebration rather than promotion.
