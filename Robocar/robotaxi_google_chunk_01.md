# Robotaxi Technology (Waymo) - Chunk 1
The Waymo Driver is a fully autonomous driving technology that differs from driver assist systems by being always in control from pickup to destination. Unlike driver assist technology which requires human attention and intervention, Waymo's system allows passengers to sit in the back seat without needing to know how to drive. The technology has been tested across millions of miles on public roads and billions of miles in simulation across multiple states in the US, making it one of the most experienced autonomous driving systems in development.
