**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

Think of tributes as the incentive bidders offer to win your vote! ## Why do I need to approve multiple lockup transactions? ------------------------------------------------------

Locking up your ATOM requires multiple approvals to ensure security and transparency. These approvals include confirming your voting power and finalizing the lockup period. We are working on simplifying the process in future updates. We’ll also add more explicit guidance so you know exactly what each step involves. ## What should I do if I get a transaction error? ----------------------------------------------

If you receive a transaction error, it could be due to an issue with the network, gas fees, or a minimum lockup amount. First, check that you have enough ATOM staked and gas available for the transaction. If the error persists, please take a screenshot and share it in the Telegram channel for support. We’re here to help resolve any issues with the Hydro system. ## Where did my ATOM go after I got voting power?

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the provided text chunk**

1. **Technical details and parameters**:
   - The text chunk describes the concept of "tributes" as incentives offered to win votes.
   - It explains the process of locking up ATOM, which requires multiple approvals for security and transparency.
   - It mentions possible issues with transaction errors, caused by network problems, gas fees, or a low minimum lockup amount.
   - It details how users should handle these errors: checking their staked ATOM and gas availability, taking a screenshot, and sharing it with the support team via Telegram.

2. **Connection to the surrounding context**:
   - The concept of tributes is mentioned in the broader context of bidding for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments in the Pilot Rounds of Hydro.
   - The process of locking up ATOM to gain voting power is connected to the **Lockups and Voting Power** section, which describes Liquid Staking Module (LSM) shares, locking and unlocking ATOM, and voting power calculation.
   - The management of transaction errors and the process of troubleshooting them is an additional requirement for users participating in Hydro's mechanisms.

3. **Specific requirements, conditions, or constraints**:
   - Users need to ensure they have enough staked ATOM and gas available for lockup transactions.
   - If users encounter transaction errors, they should take a screenshot and share it in the Telegram channel for support.
   - The process of locking up ATOM and gaining voting power involves multiple approvals to ensure security and transparency.

This text chunk provides supplementary information for users participating in the Hydro system, aiming to facilitate their understanding of tributes, lockups, and the bidding process, while also offering a framework for troubleshooting potential issues.
