**Additional insights**

The tweet seems to be trying to convey a sense of superiority by downplaying KASTcard's growth compared to larger players like Visa and JP Morgan. This might be an attempt to build credibility or attract attention from investors or media outlets. However, the tone comes across as condescending and dismissive, which could potentially harm the company's reputation or relationships with its audience.
