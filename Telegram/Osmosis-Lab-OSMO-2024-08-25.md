## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. So first, I need to go through each message and identify what's important.

Starting from the bottom, profesija asks if there's any news about Osmosis in the last ten days. Khuwarzmi responds by directing them to check the pinned messages, which probably contain important updates. Then they mention that Osmosis launched order books and a new portfolio page, with a link to a Twitter post. That's a key point.

profesija says "Wow limit orders nice" after Khuwarzmi mentions that you can use other stablecoins too. Metamo0n asks if limit orders are only possible with USDC, and Khuwarzmi clarifies that for selling, you can choose USDC or USDT. Svansy notes that the "swap to other" feature has more options. Metamo0n also mentions they'll send you to the swap feature without limits.

The osmosis_statbot messages just direct to the support site. So those are probably less critical unless the user needs support, but since the focus is on key points and decisions, maybe just mention the support link once.

Putting it all together, the main points are the launch of order books and portfolio page, availability of limit orders (initially USDC, then expanded to USDT and other stablecoins), and the swap feature having more options. Also, the user is directed to check pinned tweets for updates.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, so I should combine related points. Maybe start with the new features launched, then the limit orders details, mention the swap options, and the support link. Avoid repeating the same info from the statbot messages unless necessary. Also note that profesija was away and checking for news, so the context is catching up on recent updates.

**Summary:**  
Osmosis recently launched order books and a new portfolio page (shared via a Twitter link). Users noted that limit orders initially appeared limited to USDC but can also be used with USDT and other stablecoins. The "swap to other" feature offers expanded options. For support, users are directed to the official site: [support.osmosis.zone](https://support.osmosis.zone). A user inquired about updates from the past 10 days, prompting references to pinned messages for key announcements.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand the text. Looking at the messages, they seem to be from a chat, possibly a support or community channel related to Osmosis, which I know is a decentralized exchange on the Cosmos network.

The first two messages are from osmosis_statbot, repeating the same thing about visiting the official support site. That's probably a recurring announcement or automated message. The main topics here would be "official support site" and maybe "support assistance."

Then there's Metamo0n saying "Will send you to swap feature and not limit." The mention of "swap feature" and "limit orders" comes up again in other messages. Svansy talks about "swap to other" having more options, so "swap options" might be another topic. Khuwarzmi mentions selling with USDC/USDT and using other stablecoins, which points to "stablecoin usage" and "selling options." Metamo0n also asks if limit orders are only possible with USDC, so "limit orders" is definitely a key topic here.

profesija reacts positively to limit orders, reinforcing that topic. Khuwarzmi then mentions Osmosis launching order books and a new portfolio page, which are significant updates. The link provided is likely to a Twitter (now X) post, so "new portfolio page" and "order books launch" are topics. 

Other interactions include profesija asking about news from the last ten days and mentioning pinned tweets. The user Khuwarzmi tells them to check pinned messages, so maybe "pinned messages" is a topic. However, since the user is asking for main topics related to Osmosis features, maybe "pinned messages" isn't as central unless it's about important announcements. But since the context is about recent news, perhaps "recent updates" could be a topic, but the specific updates are already covered.

Putting it all together, the main topics seem to be around the new features launched: order books and portfolio page. Then there's the swap functionality, including options and stablecoins, limit orders, and the support site. I should list each distinct topic without repetition. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The support site is mentioned twice, so that's one topic. Limit orders are discussed in a

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and figure out the sentiment. The user wants positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting from the bottom, the oldest message is profesija asking about news on Osmosis in the last ten days. Khuwarzmi responds to check pinned messages, and profesija says they know but most are pinned tweets. The üòÖ emoji here might indicate a light-hearted or slightly annoyed tone, but not too negative. Maybe neutral?

Then Khuwarzmi mentions Osmosis launched order books and a new portfolio page, with a link. profesija says "Wow limit orders nice" ‚Äì that's positive. Metamo0n asks if limit orders are only possible with USDC, and Khuwarzmi replies that other stablecoins can be used too. Svansy comments that "swap to other" has more options, which sounds positive. Metamo0n follows up saying they'll send to the swap feature without limits, which is positive. 

The two osmosis_statbot messages are just support links, so neutral. 

Putting it all together: most messages are either neutral (the bot announcements and support links) or positive (comments on features and options). There's no explicit negative language. The only possible neutral with slight annoyance is profesija's emoji, but overall the thread seems positive. So the overall sentiment is positive.
</think>

The sentiment of this text is **positive**.  

### Breakdown:  
1. **Positive**:  
   - "Wow limit orders nice" (direct praise for a feature).  
   - "Osmosis launched the order books and new portfolio page" (excitement about new updates).  
   - Comments like "other stable coins too" and "more options" highlight satisfaction with flexibility.  
   - Metamo0n's message implies approval of the swap functionality.  

2. **Neutral**:  
   - The bot messages ("If you need help...") are informational.  
   - Profesija's mention of pinned tweets with üòÖ suggests mild frustration but not overt negativity.  

3. **No Negative Sentiment**:  
   - All user discussions focus on clarifying features, sharing updates, or expressing enthusiasm.  

The overall tone reflects engagement with new features and appreciation for expanded options, leaning positive.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I'll read through the messages carefully to understand the context.

The first two messages are from osmosis_statbot, both directing users to the official support site. That seems like a recurring reminder, so maybe that's an action item for users to visit the support site if they need help. Then there's a message from Metamo0n saying "Will send you to swap feature and not limit" ‚Äì that sounds like a next step or an action someone is taking, which is directing to the swap feature instead of using limit orders. 

Svansy mentions that "swap to other" has more options. That might indicate a decision to use the swap feature for more options. Khuwarzmi says for selling, you can choose USDC/USDT, and also mentions using other stablecoins. So those could be actions related to trading options. Then Metamo0n asks if limit orders are only possible to and from USDC. Khuwarzmi earlier mentioned that Osmosis launched order books and a new portfolio page, with a link. That's probably an action item to check the link for updates. 

Profesija says they'll go one by one, which is a next step after being told to check pinned messages. They also mention that almost all are pinned tweets, so maybe an action to review pinned tweets. Khuwarzmi tells profesija to check the pinned messages, which is a direct action item. 

Putting this all together, the main action items would be visiting the support site, checking the pinned messages or tweets, reviewing the new order books and portfolio page via the link, using swap instead of limit orders, and using other stablecoins for selling. I need to make sure each of these is clearly identified and phrased as an action item, decision, or next step without adding extra info. Let me list them out.
</think>

**Action Items, Decisions, or Next Steps Extracted:**  
1. **Visit Osmosis official support site** for assistance: [https://support.osmosis.zone](https://support.osmosis.zone).  
2. **Check the pinned messages/tweets** for updates or important information.  
3. **Review the newly launched order books and portfolio page** via the linked Twitter post: [https://x.com/osmosiszone
