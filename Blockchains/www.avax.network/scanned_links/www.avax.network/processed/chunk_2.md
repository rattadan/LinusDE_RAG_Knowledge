# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_2.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://www.avax.network/*

### Document Overview  
The document explains how Avalanche validators earn staking rewards by securing the network with AVAX tokens, emphasizing the relationship between staking, rewards, and network security.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Validators**: Nodes responsible for validating transactions and blocks in the Proof-of-Stake system.  
- **Staking**: Holding AVAX tokens to secure the network, earning rewards in return.  
- **AVAX Rewards**: Tokens distributed to stakers as incentives for securing the network.  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create blocks, ensuring security and energy efficiency.  
- **Gas Token**: A network-specific token used to pay for transaction processing fees.  
- **Subnets**: Customizable blockchain networks on Avalanche, allowing developers to tailor configurations (e.g., gas tokens, validators).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Staking Process**: Users run a node, stake AVAX, and earn AVAX rewards for securing the network.  
- **Reward Calculation**: Rewards are tied to staking activity and network performance, with specifics not explicitly detailed but implied through the context of energy efficiency and scalability.  
- **Node Requirements**: Running a validator requires a node (e.g., a full node) and staking AVAX tokens.  
- **Gas Token Customization**: Subnets allow developers to configure their own gas token, enabling tailored transaction fee structures.  

### Related Topics  
- **Subnet Architecture**: The document connects to the "Subnet Architecture" section, highlighting how subnets enable customizations for developers.  
- **Developer Tools**: The "Developer tools" section is referenced, emphasizing the role of developers in building and managing subnets.  
- **Avalanche Fundamentals**: The document ties back to the "Avalanche Fundamentals" section, underscoring the importance of staking in securing the network.
