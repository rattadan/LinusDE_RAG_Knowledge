**Additional Observations**

* The tweets and messages are often long-winded and use elaborate language to express opinions.
* Many of the tweets contain emotive language, which can make them more engaging but also less persuasive in a factual sense.
* Some authors (e.g., Darky1k) seem to be more outspoken and opinionated than others (e.g., @Darky1k), leading to differing opinions on market trends and investment strategies.
