## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 50

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

An improved version
to overcome this issue can be found, e.g., in De Souza et al. (2020)
and Wallar et al. (2018). They use the same idea, but stop the repositioning when the absolute supply per zone equals the absolute expected
demand. In De Souza et al. (2020), a matching problem is built to
ensure that the actual supply in each zone is at least as big as a specified
minimum supply while minimizing the travel time for repositioning. The minimum supply is calculated based on the expected demand for
each zone. To ensure feasibility in times of undersupply, they scale
the minimum supply linearly down from the expected demand until
a feasible solution for the problem can be found. We implemented a slightly different version of this global matchingbased strategy. In a first step, the supply per zone is determined. Here,
all vehicles that are either idling in this zone or have the destination
of their last scheduled job in this zone are counted.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details:**

1. The proposed solution involves identifying and counting vehicles that are either idling in a specific zone or have the destination of their last scheduled job in that zone.
2. These identified vehicles are then used as the "minimum supply" for repositioning, ensuring that they meet both the expected demand and travel time requirements.

**Context:**

1. The current text chunk is connected to the surrounding context by discussing various studies, research papers, and approaches (algorithms) being explored to optimize shared autonomous ride-hailing systems.
2. The proposed solution is part of a broader discussion on fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing in these systems.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

1. The minimum supply is calculated based on the expected demand for each zone, ensuring feasibility in times of undersupply.
2. The proposed solution aims to optimize the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches.
3. The approach scales linearly down from the expected demand until a feasible solution can be found when there is undersupply.

The specific requirements mentioned include:

* Ensuring that vehicles meeting the minimum supply requirement meet both expected demand and travel time requirements
* Scaling linearly down from the expected demand to find a feasible solution in times of undersupply

Overall, this chunk is explaining an improved version of a dynamic optimization model for managing fleet operations in shared autonomous ride-hailing systems.
