A. Fielbaum et al. 1.2. Related work
New technologies have induced a boom in the research that deals with transport systems where cars are shared (but rides are not),
which is surveyed in Narayanan et al. (2020), Wang and Yang (2019). In that context, ridesharing systems have also been studied with
increasing intensity. The optimization problem that underlies these systems is much more complex than in the non-sharing case: when
new requests have to be assigned to the fleet, the set of feasible solutions now also includes every possible matching between requests. Methods to operate such systems include agent-based models (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2018; Martinez and Viegas, 2017; Vosooghi
et al., 2019) and algorithmic approaches.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk focuses on the following specific aspects:

1. **Technical details**: The context mentions mathematical modeling and decomposition methods for ridesharing problems with flexible pickup and delivery locations (Zhao et al., 2018). Additionally, it references Agent-based models and algorithmic approaches used to operate ride-sharing systems (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2018; Martinez and Viegas, 2017; Vosooghi et al., 2019).
2. **Contextual connections**: The chunk establishes the relevance of ridesharing systems in urban contexts, as mentioned in the key themes section. It also mentions real-world applications such as Narayanan et al.'s (2020) work on transport systems where cars are shared but rides are not.
3. **Requirements and constraints**: There is no explicit mention of specific requirements or constraints, but the context implies that researchers have identified significant challenges in ridesharing systems, including optimizing the assignment of new requests to the fleet.

This chunk appears to build upon the surrounding context by:

* Building on the discussion of mathematical modeling and decomposition methods
* Expanding the scope to include Agent-based models and algorithmic approaches
* Establishing relevance with real-world applications
* Introducing technical details related to ridesharing problems

To provide a more focused analysis, I would like to know which specific requirements or conditions are mentioned in the surrounding context. Could you please clarify what is being asked?
