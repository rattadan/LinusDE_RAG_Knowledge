**Original Text:**

Bischoff and Maciejewski (2016) suggest an improved strategy for
undersupply scenarios in which there are more open requests than

• All vehicles: Vehicles are always available to receive a new request, except when they already have an open request assigned to
them that has not yet been picked up. Repositioning jobs can be
interrupted to pick up customers. This setting provides the most
flexibility and the highest number of assignable vehicles. • All but repositioning vehicles: Here, the same vehicles are available
as before, except for the vehicles that are currently repositioning. This setting ensures that the planned fleet repositioning is fully
implemented and not affected by repositioning jobs being aborted
half-way through to serve incoming requests. 4

gained from the matching. Since longer requests have a larger
total reward, they would be preferred in this setting.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

The technical details mentioned are related to dynamic dispatch strategies for ride-hailing systems. Specifically:

* The "undersupply scenario" refers to situations where there are more open requests than available vehicles.
* The two repositioning settings:
	+ "All vehicles": All vehicles, except those currently repositioning, allow for flexible and high-capacity handling of incoming requests.
	+ "All but repositioning vehicles": Vehicles that can be repurposed as perpositioning jobs are available, while others remain in their current assignment.

**Connecting to or Building upon the Surrounding Context:**

This chunk connects to the broader topic of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems. It discusses specific strategies for handling undersupply scenarios, such as those involving long requests or vehicle repositioning. The context also introduces related concepts, like the use of reward mechanisms (e.g., longer requests preferred) and the importance of matching between request length and fleet capacity.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

The requirements mentioned are:

* Flexibility in handling undersupply scenarios
* High-capacity handling for long requests
* Ability to handle vehicle repositioning jobs without disrupting planned fleet operations

No specific conditions or constraints are explicitly stated in this chunk. However, the references provided (e.g., Bischoff & Maciejewski) suggest that there may be additional considerations and requirements, such as ensuring that repositioning vehicles can be accommodated within a given time frame.

Overall, this chunk provides insight into dynamic dispatch strategies for managing undersupply scenarios in ride-hailing systems, highlighting the importance of flexibility, capacity management, and vehicle repositioning.
