Putting these tweets in the bigger context of the account's intentions:
The VelodromeFi account is clearly focused on promoting their decentralized exchange platform and attracting liquidity providers. They highlight high-yield opportunities to entice users to provide liquidity. They also emphasize their growth metrics to build credibility and trust. The cross-chain approach suggests they're positioning themselves as a major player in the DeFi space that can provide liquidity across multiple ecosystems. By welcoming new projects like Relend Network and promoting their integrations with various chains, they're trying to establish themselves as a central hub for liquidity in the Superchain ecosystem.

4. YieldFarming
5. DEX

I could also add:
