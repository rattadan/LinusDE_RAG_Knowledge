<think>
Let me analyze these tweets/messages systematically to address all the requested elements:

1. Main topics/themes discussed:
Looking at these messages, I see:
- Sexual vulgarities/offensive content ("Do u eat dicks or ur mom's poop", "Wanna sell ur mom's pussy.k")
- Cryptocurrency trading ("anyone wanna sell pi then dm me" - referring to Pi Network cryptocurrency)
- Aggressive, provocative communication style
- Potential trolling behavior

2. Language style and tone:
- Informal texting style with abbreviations ("u" for "you")
- Offensive and provocative language
- Very brief and blunt statements
- Inappropriate and vulgar tone
- The messages about the author's mother are meant to provoke or insult
- The message about Pi Network is direct and transactional

3. Evaluation of legitimacy:
- The messages appear to be from a channel named "Cosmos Airdrop Chat", which suggests it's related to cryptocurrency airdrops
- However, the offensive content seems unrelated to legitimate cryptocurrency discussions
- The message about selling Pi cryptocurrency appears legitimate on its face, but the other messages suggest this channel may not be professional or serious
- The content seems more like trolling or inappropriate humor rather than legitimate communication
- The username "CosmosAirdrops" would typically be associated with blockchain airdrops, but the content doesn't align with professional standards for such communications

4. Which Ecosystem or project the account advertises:
- The channel name "Cosmos Airdrop Chat" suggests affiliation with the Cosmos ecosystem
- The message "anyone wanna sell pi then dm me" refers to Pi Network, which is a separate mobile cryptocurrency project
- However, given the vulgar and trolling nature of the other messages, it's questionable whether this channel truly represents any legitimate project in the Cosmos ecosystem or Pi Network
- The content doesn't appear to be official marketing or promotion for any reputable blockchain project
