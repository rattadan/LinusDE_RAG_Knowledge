**Original Text:**

Further, if we use an insertion heuristic (as explained in Section 2.4.1 and
applied in Section 3.2.1) and we insert the requests in the same order they emerged, then such relative positions will always remain
unaffected. 3.1. Results over a toy network
In order to analyze if the proposed heuristics help to solve this problem and perform different types of sensitivity analyses, we first
study a small instance (also used by Fielbaum, 2021), in which we can optimize without using the heuristics, and compare the results
with the ones obtained using them. The base graph we use is as follows: a 10 × 10 grid, in which streets can be slow (20 km/h), midspeed (30 km/h), or fast (40 km/h). Mid-speed streets are unidirectional, and the others are bidirectional. All the arcs are assumed to
have the same length (0.15 km), so walking times are the same everywhere; walking speed is 5 [km/h]. The network is depicted in
Fig. 4.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific text chunk is explaining the **results over a toy network** part of the paper, which focuses on sensitivity analyses and heuristics to solve optimization problems.

**Technical details:**

* The use of sensitivity analysis involves analyzing how different parameters or changes affect the results.
* In this case, the authors are testing whether proposed heuristics (such as insertion heuristic) help to optimize solutions in ridesharing systems by comparing results obtained without using these heuristics.
* The specific graph used is a 10 × 10 grid with slow streets, mid-speed streets, and fast streets, where walking times and speeds are equal everywhere.

**Context:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context of the paper, which discusses various strategies for rebalancing ridesharing systems, modeling mathematical frameworks, optimization heuristics, simulation and service design, flexible transport services, ride-sharing systems with meeting points, vehicle rebalancing for mobility-on-demand systems, and reinforcement learning approaches.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints:**

* The authors need a toy network to perform sensitivity analyses and test the effectiveness of proposed heuristics.
* They require a 10 × 10 grid graph to represent the ridesharing system, with slow streets, mid-speed streets, and fast streets.
* The network must have equal walking times and speeds everywhere in order for the analysis to be meaningful.

This chunk is explaining how the authors plan to use sensitivity analyses and heuristics to improve optimization problems in ridesharing systems. It sets the stage for further investigation into the effectiveness of these techniques in various scenarios.
