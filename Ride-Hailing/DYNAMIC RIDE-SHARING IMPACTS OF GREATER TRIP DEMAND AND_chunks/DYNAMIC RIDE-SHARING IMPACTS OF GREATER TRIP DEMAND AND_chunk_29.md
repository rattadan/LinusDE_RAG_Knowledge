## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 29

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Fleet vehicles idling about 60-65% was found to be
the right balance between meeting existing demand, and with low response times. About 10 more
person-trips are made per SAV per day owing to the use of DRS, but this gap unsurprisingly
narrows with increase in density. Stop aggregation allows the fleet to idle up to 8% more
highlighting better fleet utilization. Average VMT per SAV over the 24 hr day falls when the
fleet is serving multiple passengers simultaneously as expected, as more SAVs are available to
serve requests across the region by lowering eVMT. There is further reduction in average VMT
with stops since the residual is converted to traveler walking trips. The use of DRS, on average,
increases travel times by 50-100% but the 24 hr average is biased high. The increase in average

travel time is higher in the 5x and 25x demand scenarios even though a higher demand is
available for matching.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the current text chunk:**

This chunk describes specific technical details related to Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), focusing on fleet management, vehicle utilization, and travel times. Here's a breakdown of the technical details, parameters, or processes described:

1. **Fleet idle time**: The average idling time for fleet vehicles is 60-65%. This suggests that the authors are examining how much time SAVs (Shared Autonomous Vehicles) spend idling before being served.
2. **Passenger trips and demand**: 10 more person-trips are made per SAV per day due to the use of Disruption Routing Strategies (DRS). However, this gap narrows with increasing density, indicating that as traffic congestion worsens, the need for DRS decreases.
3. **Stop aggregation**: The authors suggest that stop aggregation allows fleets to idle up to 8% more, highlighting better fleet utilization. This is a specific process related to how vehicles are scheduled and managed during peak periods.

The chunk also mentions:

1. **Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messaging**: The use of DRS increases travel times by 50-100%. However, the 24-hour average travel time is biased high.
2. **Variable pricing strategies**: The increase in average VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) with stops is attributed to residual demand and lower eVMT (expected Vehicle Miles Traveled).

**Connection to surrounding context:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing technical details on fleet management, vehicle utilization, and travel times.
2. Explaining how these concepts relate to shared autonomous vehicles, such as Disruption Routing Strategies (DRS) and variable pricing strategies.

**Requirements and constraints:**

The authors require specific information extraction or analysis of the following references:

* K.M. Kockelman
* J.W. Ward
* M. Yan
* T. Stoiber
* et al.
* For extracting specific studies or trends across papers, such as analyzing VMT per SAV or travel times in different scenarios.

The text also requires context about the timeframe spanning from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field of shared autonomous vehicles.
