and go-to-market strategies.

The key to preparing for Codebase isn't having a perfect idea. Many of Codebase's most successful projects, such as theChiss protocol, werenât the foundersâ original ideas when they entered the program. The important thing is for founders to come prepared to test their assumptions and adapt their vision based on feedback from mentors and potential customers.

As Codebase begins to evaluateapplications for its third cohort, Ava Labs continues to focus on supporting founders who can build enduring businesses that solve real customer problems on Avalanche. The program's combination of financial support, technical resources, and strategic guidance provides a unique opportunity for Web3 founders ready to transform their ideas into real-world products. Success in the application process and the program itself comes down to demonstrating not just the potential of your idea, but your team's readiness to execute and adapt in the fast-paced world of Web3 development.

Codebase isn't looking for perfect ideas. Weâre looking for founders who can turn good ideas into great businesses. Our program has proven that in ten weeks, prepared founders can go from concept to testnet. The only question is: will you be one of them?

Avalanche is an ultra-fast, low-latency blockchain platform designed for builders who need high performance at scale. The networkâs architecture allows for the creation of sovereign, efficient and fully interoperable public and private layer 1 (L1) blockchains which leverage the Avalanche Consensus Mechanism to achieve high throughput and near-instant transaction finality. The ease and speed of launching a L1, and the breadth of architectural customization choices, make Avalanche the perfect environment for a composable multi-chain future.

Supported by a global community of developers and validators, Avalanche offers a fast, low-cost environment for building decentralized applications (dApps).
