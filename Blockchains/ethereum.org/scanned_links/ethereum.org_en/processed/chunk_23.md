# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_23.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://ethereum.org/en/*

### Document Overview  
The content explains how to manage Ethereum addresses, wallet usage, and transaction processes on Ethereum networks, emphasizing security, cross-chain compatibility, and transaction confirmations.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Ethereum Address**: A unique identifier for a user’s wallet, shared across all Ethereum projects.  
- **Wallet Interface**: A tool to manage balances, send transactions, and recover accounts.  
- **EVM Compatibility**: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility allows cross-chain use of the same address on supported blockchains.  
- **Transaction Confirmations**: Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be canceled, emphasizing the need for careful transaction setup.  
- **Network Consistency**: Ensuring the sender and recipient use the same network (e.g., mainnet vs. testnet) to avoid errors.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Address Copying**: Users are advised to copy the Ethereum address manually, but this risks errors.  
- **Cross-Chain Usage**: The same address can be used on EVM-compatible blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) if the wallet supports recovery phrases.  
- **Transaction Steps**:  
  1. Open the wallet app.  
  2. Send ETH to another wallet by copying the address.  
  3. Verify the recipient’s address and network alignment.  
- **Block Explorer Usage**: Users can check transaction status via block explorers using the wallet address or transaction ID.  

### Related Topics  
- **Blockchain Interoperability**: The content connects to topics like cross-chain transactions and EVM compatibility.  
- **Wallet Security**: Emphasizes the importance of recovery phrases and avoiding manual address entry for security.  
- **Transaction Management**: Links to technical details about transaction confirmations and network alignment.

your public address. Many wallet apps let you copy your address or show a QR code to scan for easier usage. Avoid typing any Ethereum address manually. This can easily lead to clerical errors and lost funds.

Different apps may vary or use different language, but they should take you through a similar process if you are trying to transfer funds.

Would you like to send ETH to another wallet?

Your address will be the same in all Ethereum projects. You do not need to register individually on any project. Once you have a wallet, you can connect to any Ethereum project without any additional information. No emails or any other personal information are needed.

You can use the same address on all EVM compatible blockchains (if you have the type of wallet with a recovery phrase). Thislist(opens in a new tab)will show you which blockchains you can use with the same address. Some blockchains, like Bitcoin, implement a completely separate set of network rules and you will need a different address with a different format. If you have a smart contract wallet you should check its product website for more info on which blockchains are supported.

Yes, you can use the same address on multiple devices. Wallets are technically only an interface to show you your balance and to make transactions, your account isn't stored inside the wallet, but on the blockchain.

You can useblock explorersto see the status of any transaction in real time. All you need to do is to search your wallet address or the ID of the transaction.

No, once a transaction is confirmed, you cannot cancel the transaction.

- Open your wallet app.
- Click on "Receive" (or similarly worded option).
- Copy your Ethereum address to clipboard.
- Provide the sender with your receiving Ethereum address.
- Open your wallet app.
- Get the receiving address and make sure you are connected to the same network as the recipient.
