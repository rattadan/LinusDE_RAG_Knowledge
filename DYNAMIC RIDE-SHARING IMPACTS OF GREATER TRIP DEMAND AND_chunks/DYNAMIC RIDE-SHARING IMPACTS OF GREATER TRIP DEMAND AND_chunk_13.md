## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 13

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

To facilitate computation, a zonebased assignment algorithm was adopted similar to Bischoff and Maciejewski (2016). POLARIS
maintains a running list of idle (zero occupants and stationary) and in-use (moving or serving a
request) vehicles by traffic analysis zones (TAZs). Requests were assigned based on the
originating zone to an SAV in that zone or in a set of neighboring zones that are constructed as a
function of maximum allowable response time. The DRS algorithm implemented here is a heuristic to facilitate better use of empty seats in
SAVs while limiting the delay experienced by each traveler in the SAV. The heuristic matched
incoming requests to available vehicles that were either idling or performing a pickup, or dropoff trip in the direction of the incoming requestâ€™s destination. Idling SAVs were automatically
matched to minimize wait time for assignment.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details behind the zone-based assignment algorithm used in the POLARIS system. Here's a focused analysis:

**Technical Details:**

* The algorithm assigns requests (requests) from different zones (TAZs) based on the originating zone.
* Requests are matched to available vehicles that are either idling or performing a pickup or dropoff trip in the direction of the incoming request's destination.
* Idling SAVs are automatically matched to minimize wait time for assignment.

**Parameters and Processes:**

* The algorithm uses traffic analysis zones (TAZs) as its input data, which is not explicitly defined in this chunk but implied through the context.
* Requests are categorized into idle, in-use, or moving trips based on their origin zone.
* Vehicles are matched to requests based on their location and direction of travel.

**Context Connection:**

This section builds upon the surrounding context by explaining how the POLARIS system uses a zone-based assignment algorithm to facilitate efficient vehicle allocation. The chunk is connected to the main topic by discussing the relevance of this algorithm in shared autonomous vehicles, specifically in optimizing ridesplitting services and reducing wait times.

The requirements and conditions mentioned include:

* A comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports on shared autonomous vehicle performance (which implies a need for data analysis and research)
* A focus on various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their impacts on urban transportation systems and consumer preferences
* Recent developments in the field from 2014 to 2020
* Key authors mentioned, which includes researchers working on autonomous vehicle optimization techniques

Overall, this chunk provides technical details on how a zone-based assignment algorithm works in the context of POLARIS.
