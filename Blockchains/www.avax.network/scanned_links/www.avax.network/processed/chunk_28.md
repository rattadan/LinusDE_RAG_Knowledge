- **QR Code Integration**: Used for attendance tracking, enabling seamless student verification.  
- **Crypto Wallets**: Unintended byproduct of the platform, enabling decentralized identity management.  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Built on blockchain technology, eliminating reliance on physical USB keys or manual processes.  
- **Expansion to South America**: Targeting rural areas to democratize access to secure, cost-effective authentication.  

### Implementation Details  
- **QR Code Attendance Tracking**: Students scan a QR code to confirm presence, eliminating the need for physical cards or USB keys.  
- **Infrastructure Use Case**: A major university in Argentina uses AutoPen’s system to track student attendance, demonstrating its scalability.  
- **Crypto Wallet Integration**: Users are automatically enrolled in a crypto wallet, enabling decentralized identity and data management.  
- **Incubator Support**: The platform received funding from Codebase, an Avalanche incubator, to scale operations and focus on technical development.  

### Related Topics  
- **Web3 Ecosystem**: AutoPen’s model aligns with broader trends in decentralized identity and authentication.  
- **Decentralized Identity**: The platform’s focus on eliminating traditional biometric processes reflects advancements in blockchain-based identity solutions.  
- **Incubator Programs**: The connection to Codebase highlights the role of incubators in supporting early-stage Web3 startups.

Around 20,000 people currently use them, but the experience is frustrating and outdated. Users have to visit an office in person, provide their biometrics, and pay $100 annually for a service that feels stuck in the early 2000s. AutoPen aims to change that by offering a more modern solution that only Web3 platforms can provide. âPeople are overpaying for a bad experience,â Cammi says. âWe can provide a smoother, more efficient alternative and charge less than what theyâre paying now.â

Unlike traditional digital signatures that rely on outdated processes, AutoPen eliminates the need for USB keys, manual processes, and complex interfaces. The platform simplifies the experience in an intuitive way with the goal of making it accessible to people with little technical knowledge. This is vital to the larger goal of expanding to rural areas across Argentina and the rest of South America.Â

Encouraged by their success, Cammi and Lavecchia applied toCodebase, an Avalanche incubator that supports promising early stage Web3 startups. They were accepted into the program, which provided them with the resources they needed to take AutoPen to the next level. âCodebase changed everything for us,â Cammi says. âIt gave us the space and support to focus on AutoPen full-time and even quit our day jobs. Without that, we wouldnât be where we are today.â

AutoPenâs infrastructure is already being used by a major university in Argentina to track attendance. Teachers issue credentials to students, who then scan a QR code to confirm their presence. This use case highlights how AutoPenâs technology can be repurposed to meet a variety of needs beyond legal signatures.Â

One of the knock-on effects of AutoPen is that users end up with a crypto wallet. This unintended consequence is key to how the company is thinking about the future. Cammi envisions a future where every person in Latin America has a crypto wallet without even realizing it.
