## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to summarize this chat text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. Alright, first I need to go through each message and figure out what's important.

Starting from the bottom, there are some tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first one thanks someone for mentioning them, and the other talks about recognizing contributors with a visual form of respect. Those seem like they're about community recognition, so maybe that's a key point.

Then there's Arhan778 asking if there will be more airdrops in the Cosmos Ecosystem. The user mentioned "decisions," but there's no direct answer here. Maybe the key point is the question itself, indicating interest in future airdrops.

Next, leonoorcosmos and AydarGA posted Twitter links. The first link is about BitCannaGlobal, the second to cosmosdrops.io, and another to SecretNetwork. Since they're links, the summary might note that they're sharing resources or updates, but without the content of the links, I can't specify details. So maybe just mention they shared links related to Cosmos.

synth_etic asked what SDK means on the Cosmos network. Then another message saying nobody knows. But SDK usually stands for Software Development Kit, so maybe the key point is the question about the term, even though there's no answer provided here.

Putting it all together: The main topics are community recognition, potential future airdrops, a question about SDK, and shared links. The decisions? Not much explicit decisions made here, just questions and shared information. The user might want the summary to highlight the questions and the recognition tweets as key points. I should structure it clearly, listing each main point in bullet form, keeping it concise. Also, note that the SDK question was unanswered. The dates are all the same day, so maybe not necessary to include timestamps unless relevant. But the user didn't specify excluding them, so focus on the content. Alright, that should cover it.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this chat text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key topics are.

Starting with the first message: synth_etic is asking about the meaning of "SDK" on the Cosmos network. So "SDK" and "Cosmos network" are probably topics here. Then another message from synth_etic saying "Nobody knows ?" with a smiley emoji. That might just be a follow-up, so maybe not a new topic.

Next, AydarGA shares two links to Twitter posts from SecretNetwork and CosmosDrops.io. Those links are specific URLs, but the main topics here might be the Twitter accounts or the content they're sharing. But since the user wants main topics, maybe "Twitter" and "SecretNetwork" and "CosmosDrops.io" as separate topics? Wait, but maybe the focus is on the platforms mentioned, like Cosmos ecosystem related Twitter accounts?

Then leonoorcosmos posts a link to a BitCannaGlobal tweet. Again, Twitter is involved here. So "Twitter" and "BitCannaGlobal" could be topics. But maybe the main point is the mention of Twitter accounts related to Cosmos?

Arhan778 asks if there will be airdrops in the Cosmos Ecosystem in the future. So "airdrop" and "Cosmos Ecosystem" are topics here. The user is specifically asking about future airdrops, so that's a key topic.

The combot messages are reposting tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first one talks about visual recognition for Cosmos community developers and "stars" with the atom emoji. So maybe "Cosmos Community" and "recognition" or "visual recognition"? The second combot message is about thanking someone for mentioning, so maybe "acknowledgment" or "thanks" but perhaps more general topics related to community interaction.

Putting this all together, the main topics I can see are:

- SDK (since that's a direct question)
- Cosmos network (the context of the SDK question)
- Airdrop (Arhan778's question)
- Cosmos Ecosystem (mentioned in Arhan778's question and the combot tweets)
- Twitter (multiple links shared)
- SecretNetwork (from AydarGA's link)
- CosmosDrops.io (another link)
- Bit

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start with the first one.

Text: synth_etic at 2022-02-01T22:22:22+00:00: Nobody knows ?üòÅ
Hmm, the user is asking if nobody knows something, and there's a smiley emoji. The question mark might indicate uncertainty, but the smiley suggests they're not upset. Maybe they're just seeking information in a friendly way. So this is probably neutral or slightly positive. But since it's a question without clear emotion, maybe neutral.

Next: synth_etic at 2022-02-01T22:09:29+00:00: Hello guys what is mean ¬´ SDK ¬ª on cosmos network ?
They're greeting everyone and asking for the meaning of SDK. It's a straightforward question, no negative words. The use of "Hello" and the emoji in the previous message might indicate a positive tone. But here, just a question, so maybe neutral. Unless "guys" and the structure imply friendliness, which could be positive. But since it's just asking for information, maybe neutral.

AydarGA at 2022-02-01T17:46:18+00:00: https://twitter.com/SecretNetwork/status/1488226433176518659
This is a URL. No text, so neutral. Links alone don't convey sentiment unless the context is known, but since it's just a link, neutral.

AydarGA at 2022-02-01T17:38:04+00:00: https://cosmosdrops.io
Same as above, a link. Neutral.

leonoorcosmos at 2022-02-01T16:23:59+00:00: https://twitter.com/BitCannaGlobal/status/1488544826509479948
Another link. Neutral.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat text. First, I'll go through each message one by one.

Starting with synth_etic's first message: "Hello guys what is mean ¬´ SDK ¬ª on cosmos network ?" They're asking for the meaning of SDK in the Cosmos context. So maybe the action item here is that someone needs to explain what SDK stands for in Cosmos. But since it's a question, the next step would be to provide an answer.

Then there's Arhan778 asking if there will be more airdrops in the Cosmos Ecosystem. The user is seeking information about future airdrops. So the next step here would be to check if there's any official information or announcements regarding upcoming airdrops in the Cosmos ecosystem.

AydarGA and leonoorcosmos posted Twitter links. The combot messages also mention tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. Those links might be pointing to announcements or information about airdrops or other activities. The action items here could be to review those tweets for any relevant information. But since the user is asking to extract from the text provided, and the text includes the links, maybe the next step is to check those links for details.

Looking at the timestamps, the most recent message is synth_etic saying "Nobody knows ?üòÅ" after their initial question. That might indicate they didn't get a response yet, so the action item is still pending an answer.

I don't see any explicit decisions made here. The users are sharing links and asking questions. So the main next steps would be to answer synth_etic's question about SDK and to check the provided links for any airdrop information related to the Cosmos ecosystem. Also, since Arhan778 is asking about future airdrops, the next step would be to look into those tweets or other sources for hints about upcoming ones.

Wait, the combot messages are retweeting or mentioning tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first combot message talks about recognizing Cosmos "stars" with a visual form of respect. The second mentions a big thanks. Maybe those are just updates and not action items. The users AydarGA and leonoorcosmos shared other tweets, which might be relevant to the discussion about airdrops. So the action items would be to check those links.

So summarizing the action items: Answer the SDK question, check the provided
