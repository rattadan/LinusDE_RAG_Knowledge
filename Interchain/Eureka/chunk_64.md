## Chunk 64

**Original Text:**

When a relayer finally comes online, it relays a timeout message to Neutron, releasing the user’s ATOM back to their address on Neutron where they first had it. For transfer-only routes: This is the only kind of failure that may happen on a route that only contains transfers. Either the user’s tokens will reach their destination chain as intended, or they will wind up with the same tokens, on the same chain where they started. In a pre-swap or swap related error, the user will end up with the same tokens they started with on their initial chain (e.g. ATOM on Neutron in this example)

**LLM Contextual Output:**

When a relayer finally comes online and is able to relay a timeout message to Neutron, it releases the user's Atomic Token (ATOM) back to its original address on Neutron, where it was first stored. This process is known as "release" or "re-release" of ATOM.

In cases where there are no transfer-only routes available, such as in scenarios involving pre-swap or swap-related errors, the relayer's release operation can be different. The user will not be able to recover their tokens, and they will remain stuck at their initial chain (i.e., with the same tokens they started with).
