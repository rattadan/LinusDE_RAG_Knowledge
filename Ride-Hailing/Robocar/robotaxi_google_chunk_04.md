# Robotaxi Technology (Waymo) - Chunk 4
Waymo's sensor system integrates multiple technologies to give the vehicle a comprehensive view of its surroundings. Lidar sensors placed around the vehicle send millions of laser pulses in all directions, measuring bounce-back time to create a 3D picture of surroundings regardless of lighting conditions. The system includes 29 cameras providing a simultaneous 360Â° view, capable of spotting traffic lights and obstacles from hundreds of meters away. Radar uses millimeter wave frequencies to detect object distance and speed, functioning effectively in adverse weather conditions.
