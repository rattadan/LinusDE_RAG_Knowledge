**Document Summary:**

**Hydro: A Comprehensive Summary**

**Background and Context**

Hydro is a decentralized platform built for the Cosmos Hub, which enables ATOM stakers to lock their ATOM to gain voting power and vote on bids for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL) deployments. Hydro's smart contracts handle the liquidity deployments, and rewards from tribute are distributed back to voters.

**Pilot Rounds and Objectives**

The Pilot Rounds aim to test critical features of Hydro, including the voting mechanism, bidding process, and liquidity deployment. The objective is to ensure that everything is working as expected before re-deploying the complete PoL available to Hydro.

**Key Components and Processes**

1. **Global and Wallet Caps**: The Hydro committee has set global caps for the maximum PoL deployable in a given round and the maximum ATOM a single wallet can lock up.
2. **PoL Cap**: The total liquidity rerouted to Hydro is expected to be close to 2.5M ATOM, but pilot rounds will start with a conservative amount of 200K native ATOM.
3. **Tribute Floor**: Round 3 introduced a minimum tribute floor, capping the maximum liquidity a bid can receive based on the tribute it distributes to voters.
4. **Custom Deployment Durations**: Projects can bid for PoL deployments lasting up to 3 months, allowing users to secure longer-term liquidity while providing flexibility in allocating voting power.
5. **Committee Oversight**: The Committee will oversee the allocation and deployment processes, intervening directly to mitigate potential risks.
6. **Tribute Refunds**: The smart contract will refund tribute to bids that receive less than 5% of the votes.
7. **Bid Submissions**: Projects submit their bid details via GitHub, and the Hydro Committee reviews and approves or rejects the bid.
8. **Voting Power**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for deployment durations of up to 3 months, granting them flexibility in participating in multi-month deployments.

**Lockups and Voting Power**

1. **Liquid Staking Module (LSM) Shares**: LSM shares represent tokenized, staked ATOM on the Cosmos Hub, which can be used to gain voting power and Hydro rewards.
2. **Locking and Unlocking ATOM**: Users can lock their staked ATOM for a specified duration to gain voting power, which can then be unlocked and converted back to staked ATOM.
3. **Voting Power Calculation**: The amount of voting power received depends on the amount of LSM shares locked and the duration of the lockup.

**APRs and Rewards**

1. **Staking APR**: The standard inflationary reward earned from staking ATOM.
2. **Voter APR**: The additional yield from tributes paid to voters by bidders seeking liquidity through Hydro.
3. **Total APR**: The yield generated by liquidity deployed into DeFi protocols, plus the voter APR.

**User and Bidder Guides**

1. **User FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions for users, including information on Protocol-Owned Liquidity, voting power, and tributes.
2. **Bidder Guide**: Outlines the process of creating and submitting bids, including requirements, bid templates, and deployment tests.

**FAQs and Deployment Process**

1. **How long do projects keep a liquidity deployment?**: Projects receive liquidity at the end of each round and keep it for the duration specified in the bid.
2. **What happens to the PoL yield generated by the liquidity?**: The yields are sent back to the Hydro Treasury for redeployment as additional capital.
3. **What are the key requirements for submitting a bid?**: Projects must use the bid template and ensure bids meet the Hydro committee's guidelines.
4. **What is the timeline for submitting and processing a bid?**: Draft the bid, schedule a review meeting, finalize the bid, and upload it to the Hydro smart contract.

Overall, Hydro aims to provide a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for managing the Cosmos Hub's liquidity while generating value for ATOM holders.

**Original Text:**

During the auction round, projects can increase the amount of tribute to attract more support. Once increased, the amount cannot be decreased. This rule prevents scenarios where a project might offer a high tribute to gain votes and then reduce it before the round ends. Before submitting a proposal, projects choose the tranche ID you want to participate in. Information about tranches can be obtained from the Hydro smart contract using the following CLI command:

neutrond q wasm contract-state smart $HYDRO_CONTRACT_ADDR '{"tranches": {}}' --node [NEUTRON_NODE_RPC]

Submit a bid in the current auction round using the following CLI command:

## Submission check
----------------

To verify that your proposal was submitted successfully, projects can query the Hydro smart contract to obtain all proposals for the given round and tranche IDs.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis of the Text Chunk**

1. **Exact Technical Details, Parameters, or Processes Described:**
   - The text chunk explains that during an auction round, projects can increase the tribute amount to attract more support, but this increase cannot be decreased.
   - It describes a process where a project selects a tranche ID to participate in, which can be obtained using a CLI command: `neutrond q wasm contract-state smart $HYDRO_CONTRACT_ADDR '{"tranches": {}}' --node [NEUTRON_NODE_RPC]`.
   - The text also shows a CLI command to submit a bid: `## Submission check`. However, this command is incomplete and only mentioned as a "Submission check".

   The technical details provided involve the interaction with the Hydro smart contract, usage of CLI commands, and the mechanism to manage tribute amounts during an auction round.

2. **How this Chunk Connects to or Builds Upon the Surrounding Context:**
   - The current text chunk builds upon the process of submitting bids (described in component 7: "**Bid Submissions**"), which is a key component in the Hydro framework.
   - The chunk is connected to the general process of managing liquidity through **Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL)** deployments, a crucial aspect of the Hydro platform.

3. **Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints Mentioned:**
   - Completeness of the CLI command for bid submission ("Submission check") is not explicitly mentioned but implied to be necessary for verification.
   - There is no mention of specific constraints or requirements for the CLI commands provided, regarding usage, input formats, or output expectations.

**Objective Analysis:**

The text chunk is explaining the process of managing tribute amounts during an auction round in the Hydro platform, specifically after a project chooses a tranche ID to participate in. This involves accessing information about tranches through CLI commands and submitting bids using a specific method, which is only partially described in the given text.
