## Chunk 80

**Original Text:**

If security or scalability concerns were to appear on the
public NKN network, nRide could always run a private NKN
network accessible only to nRide users. 24

communication between nRide users, essentially rendering it
unusable. Pub/Sub scalability: The pub/sub mechanism enables
drivers to subscribe to location-based topics and receive all
incoming requests from all riders in that location. If two
many users are subscribed to the same location at the same
time, the network could be overwhelmed and result in a bad
user experience. This scalability issue can be addressed by adjusting the
granularity of the spatial-index which assigns users to a
location.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you've provided a passage discussing potential issues with the NKN (Node-Knowledge Network) public network, specifically regarding security, scalability, and pub/sub (Publish-Subscribe) functionality.

To summarize:

1. **Security concerns**: If security or scalability issues arise on the public NKN network, nRide could implement a private network accessible only to users, rendering it unusable.
2. **Pub/Sub scalability issue**: The NKN network's pub/sub mechanism can lead to overcrowding if many subscribers are accessing the same location at the same time, resulting in poor user experiences.
3. **Solution: Granularity adjustment**: One potential solution is to adjust the spatial-index (a way of organizing and mapping locations) to more granularly assign users to specific locations.

This approach addresses scalability concerns by reducing the number of concurrent connections between drivers and their subscribers, allowing for a better user experience.
