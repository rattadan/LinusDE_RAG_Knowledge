Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a bunch of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and another user, svAbhishek. I need to go through each message and determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with the first one: "Gregory Landua returns to CEO-role in Regen Network". Returning to a CEO role is usually a positive thing, especially if it's a planned or welcomed change. So that's probably positive.

Next: "Terra Project Spotlight ‚Äî Kash". A project spotlight is likely positive as it highlights a project, so positive.

"THORChain has +2B RUNE marketcap" ‚Äì Reaching a significant market cap like $2 billion is a positive achievement. Positive.
