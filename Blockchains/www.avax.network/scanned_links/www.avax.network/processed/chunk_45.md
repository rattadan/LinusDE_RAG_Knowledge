of the program such as the importance of making decisive pivots, storytelling, understanding the unique benefits of the Avalanche ecosystem, and the support of a deep advisor network to help with all aspects of company building.

When Kparobo Abala and Agbona Igwemohjoined Codebaseas one of 5 startups in the programâs second cohort, they thought they had their startup idea figured out. But less than one month after joining the incubator they had completely pivoted to building a new productâChiss Protocolâthat was ultimately selected as one of the three winning projects during the Codebase Demo Day in December.

The decision to make a product pivot is typically among the hardest that early stage founders ever have to make. Itâs no secret that most product pivots fail, which leads many founders to delay the decision or pursue hail-mary efforts to save the original idea rather than adjusting course. But the reality is that pivots donât typically fail because the new idea isnât viable. They fail because the founders didnât take decisive action.Â

In most startup incubators, âpivotâ is a dirty word that suggests a lack of founder conviction or ability to execute on an original idea. Founders are expected to come equipped with a well-developed idea, technical roadmap, and go-to-market strategyâthe rest is pure execution. But for Michael Martin, who directs the Codebase program at Ava Labs, pivots arenât verbotenâif anything, theyâre encouraged.Â

This requires more than making founders feel comfortable with experimenting and exploring new ideas. Any founder can pivot, but making that pivot successful requires support from a network of mentors and advisors that can help crystalize and validate new ideas. For founders building on Avalanche, that often means providing founders with access to Ava Labsâ technical expertise, network, and tooling to support the development of their product.
