**Original Text:**

Almost all the
rejected requests would have departed from the center of the network, whereas their destinations are much more distributed. This
suggests that the rebalancing process is not enough to allocate a sufficient number of vehicles to pick-up new passengers in the center,
which reinforces the need for researching better rebalancing or predictive techniques (Wallar et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2017; Spieser
et al., 2016; Alonso-Mora et al., 2017). In all, Figs. 8–11 suggest that users departing from or arriving at the most demanded zones from the network expect a worse quality
of service. This is verified by Table 7, where we study how nodes’ measures change as they move away from the center of the network. To do this, we consider Times Square as the center of Manhattan, we calculate its distance to each node in the network, and we
compute the respective linear correlations between such distances and the measures shown in Figs.
