**Source:** [Autoweek - Hereâ€™s How Lyft Benefits in Purchasing This Ride-Hailing Company](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a64523988/lyft-freenow-ride-hailing-app/)
**Date Added:** 2025-04-21

## Summary
Lyft has purchased the multi-mobility app FreeNow from Mercedes-Benz Mobility and BMW Group for $197 million, marking a significant expansion into Europe. FreeNow operates in nine European countries and over 150 cities, offering services from taxis to luxury limousines. This move is part of a broader trend of industry consolidation as ride-hailing companies seek market share and prepare for the eventual arrival of robotaxis. Despite the hype around autonomous vehicles, companies like Lyft and Uber remain focused on traditional ride-hailing and app-based bookings, as many European taxi bookings are still made offline. FreeNow will continue to operate under its own brand, and both Lyft and FreeNow leadership emphasize collaboration and learning from each other. The acquisition also reflects automakers' shifting interest in mobility services, with some stepping back from direct involvement.
