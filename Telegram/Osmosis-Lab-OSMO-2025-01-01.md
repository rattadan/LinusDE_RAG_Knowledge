## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. Let me start by going through each message.

First, Ankola1979 asks about the price expectation for OSMOS this year. Then there's cloudune mentioning reaching 50k impressions. Svansy talks about sending dust drops to burn addresses and wishing for a burn function in Keplr. ParaFl0w responds to that, mentioning Osmosis deals with wallet cleanliness. 

Amaz13002 asks if there's a DApp converting small tokens to ATOM or OSMO, and others like mikebarb say they don't know. There's a discussion about transaction fees scaling with usage, protorev burns, and taker fees. JohnnyWyles87 mentions the thirdening affecting staking prominence. 

They also talk about improving Osmosis as an efficient execution location for cross-chain swaps, which ties into tokenomics discussions like buybacks and burns. There's a mention of a possible tiered fee system based on OSMO staking and volume. 

Other parts include support links, questions about USDC on Noble chain, gas adjustments in Keplr, and IBC channels for Shido. The main decisions seem to be around tokenomics strategies, improving liquidity, and technical aspects like gas fees and IBC channels.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: Osmosis's focus on efficient cross-chain swaps, tokenomics improvements through burns and buybacks, the upcoming thirdening affecting staking, potential tiered fee system, and technical support details like gas adjustments and IBC channels. Also, note the community's interest in better wallet functions and token demand.

**Summary:**  
The discussion centers on Osmosis (OSMO) tokenomics and technical operations. Key points include:  
- **Token Demand Strategies:** Proposed measures to boost $OSMO demand include protorev burns, taker fee buybacks, and potential tiered fee systems tied to staking and trading volume.  
- **Thirdening Impact:** Enhanced staking prominence expected post-2025 thirdening, alongside increased liquidity from Mars' improved deposit methods and new lst protocols.  
- **Wallet Efficiency:** Users express desire for a "burn tokens" function in Keplr and discuss managing dust tokens via manual transactions.  
- **Cross-Chain Swaps

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this chat text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the main subjects are.

Starting with Ankola1979 asking about the price expectation for OSMOS this year. That's clearly about price expectations and OSMOS, which is a token related to Osmosis. Then cloudune mentions reaching 50k impressions, which seems like a marketing or growth metric. 

Svansy talks about sending dust drops to burn addresses and wishing for a burn function in Keplr. Dust drops and token burning are topics here. ParaFl0w responds, mentioning Osmosis dealing with wallet cleanliness, which ties into token management or efficiency. 

Amaz13002 and mikebarb discuss converting small token amounts (dust) into ATOM or OSMO, referencing a DApp. So token conversion, dust, and maybe the need for a DApp or feature. The conversation includes transaction fees for each dust conversion, which relates to transaction costs. 

There's a mention of the Osmosis roadmap, tokenomics improvements, and demand for $OSMO. Also, discussions about implementing a tiered fee system based on staking and volume. So tokenomics, fee market, staking, and ecosystem growth are topics. 

Other messages include questions about IBC channels, gas limits, transaction errors, and bridges for USDT from BNB to Cosmos. Technical aspects like IBC channels, gas adjustments, transaction issues, and cross-chain bridges come up. 

Happy New Year greetings are there, but those are probably not topics. The support site links and admin commands might be less relevant. 

Putting it all together, the main topics would be: price expectations for OSMOS, tokenomics improvements, dust token conversion, token burning, IBC channels, transaction fees, cross-chain bridges, gas limit adjustments, transaction errors, wallet functionality (Keplr), staking, fee market dynamics, ecosystem growth, and tiered fee systems. 

I need to make sure these are concise and in a list without repeating. Maybe combine some related terms. Let me check again. Osmosis-related topics dominate, so terms like Osmosis tokenomics, Osmosis ecosystem, and Osmosis staking could be part of it. Also, mentions of specific tokens like ATOM and EVM

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- osmosis (13 mentions)
- support (11 mentions)
- can (8 mentions)
- osmo (6 mentions)
- chain (6 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from Osmosis, and I need to determine the overall sentiment. First, I'll go through each message one by one.

Starting with Ankola1979 asking about price expectations for OSMOS. That's a neutral question, just seeking information. Then cloudune mentions reaching 50k impressions, which sounds positive, like an achievement. Svansy talks about burning tokens and wishing for a burn function in Keplr. Burning tokens can be positive as it reduces supply, but the wish for a feature might indicate a slight negative due to current limitation. ParaFl0w responds to that, mentioning Osmosis handles it for wallet cleanliness, which is positive.

amaz13002 has several messages. First, a thank you with üòÅ, which is positive. Then asking about a dapp to convert small tokens, which is neutral. The "Hi all and happy new year" is positive. ParaFl0w also says "Happy 2025" and praises Osmosis, so definitely positive. The statbot links are neutral, just providing support info. Bonnie2380's question about everyone's day is neutral, but friendly.

JohnnyWyles87's long message discusses transaction fees, protorev burn, taker fees, staking, and future plans. It's informative and neutral, but mentions looking forward to a tiered fee system, which could be seen as positive. The user_343756695 asks about increasing $osmo demand and tokenomics, suggesting room for improvement. That's a bit negative but constructive. jasbanza says "Not yet. Needs liquidity" which is negative but factual. Lord_Nadie asks if Atone is tradeable, which is neutral. Dynamic_01node's "Happy New Year" is positive. jasbanza gives a link, neutral. KRYPTO_NIGHT asks about a bridge, neutral. kychuli and Anviau discuss transaction errors and gas limits, which are negative due to issues faced. More statbot messages are neutral. Then there's a back-and-forth about IBC channels and transaction failures. mikebarb is helpful, suggesting solutions, which is positive, but the user is experiencing issues, which is negative.

Overall, there's a mix. Positive sentiments come from greetings, achievements

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any parts that indicate something needs to be done, a decision made, or a step to follow up.

Starting with the first message from Ankola1979 asking about price expectations for OSMOS. That's a question, not an action item. Then cloudune mentions reaching 50k impressions this week. That's a goal or target, but not sure if it's an action item for someone else. Maybe just a statement.

Svansy says they're sending dust drops to burn addresses and wish for a burn function in Keplr. The wish here might indicate a feature request, so that's a possible action item for the Keplr team or Osmosis developers. Then ParaFl0w mentions Osmosis deals with wallet cleanliness, maybe implying that Osmosis is working on solutions for dust tokens, so that's a next step.

Amaz13002 asks about a DApp converting small token amounts to ATOM or OSMO. Mikebarb replies that they don't know of any for OSMO or ATOM. The question is a request for information, but the action item here might be to develop such a DApp if none exists. Then there's a discussion about transaction fees and gas limits on Keplr. Anviau asks how to change the gas limit on Keplr, and kychuli responds about checking the transaction or opening a support ticket. So action items here could be for the user to adjust gas settings or contact support.

Looking at the messages from JohnnyWyles87, he talks about transaction fees, proto-rev burn, taker fees, staking, and possible tiered fee systems. There's a mention of a forum thread about tiered fees but nothing confirmed yet. So maybe the next step is to monitor that thread or participate in discussions. He also mentions improving existing markets as a focus.

KRYPTO_NIGHT asks about a bridge for USDT from BNB to Cosmos, and jasbanza provides a link to SquidRouter. That's a resource provided, not an action item unless someone needs to follow up on it. 

Ankola1979 has an error on the Osmos app and wants to swap EVMOS. The action
