## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 17

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

Travelers driving a vehicle are routed on the network, and those riding in a
personal vehicle driven by another member of the household is artificially simulated (i.e., taking
into account travel time, but not the vehicle trajectory). The outcome of travelersâ€™ activity

schedule is also that all trips choosing to use an SAV/TNC is currently single-party trips. In
reality, travelers choosing to use these services typically do so as multiple-traveler parties. Results stemming from this assumption make the results more conservative. However, all
travelers opting to use the fleet are assumed to be willing to share (irrespective of the final
routing outcome). Therefore, these opposing objectives balance out some of the fleet impacts to a
certain extent. Stop-Based Pickups and Dropoffs (PUDOs)
PUDO locations have been implemented here as a subset of activity locations that exists in and
used by all modes of travel in POLARIS.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Analysis**

This specific section describes the technical details and processes involved in routing travelers on a network, specifically using simulated traffic scenarios to optimize schedules. Here's a breakdown of its exact technical details, parameters, or processes:

1. Simulation: The section mentions "artificially simulated" travel time and trajectory for personal vehicles, implying a simulation-based approach to modeling real-world traffic conditions.
2. Routing outcome: The simulation is aimed at determining the optimal routing schedule for travelers using Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) and Transit-Non-Transit (TNC) services.
3. Assumptions:
	* Travelers choose SAV/TNCs as their preferred transportation method.
	* All trips, including solo travelers, are assumed to be single-party trips.
	* Travelers who opt for SAV/TNCs are willing to share the journey, balancing out fleet impacts.

**Connection to surrounding context**

This chunk builds upon the context by:

1. Providing a clear understanding of the research focus: The text introduces shared autonomous vehicles and their potential impact on urban transportation systems.
2. Explaining the simulation-based approach: This allows readers to understand how researchers are modeling real-world traffic conditions using simulated scenarios.

**Requirements, conditions, or constraints**

There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk that would affect its interpretation or analysis:

* The text assumes a general understanding of transportation systems and autonomous vehicles.
* No technical specifications or limitations are provided for the simulation or routing algorithm used.
