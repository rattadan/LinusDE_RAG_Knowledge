## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages, so I need to parse through each one and pick out the important info.

First, the main topic seems to be about the deprecation of IBC support. BasementNodes mentions "They are deprecating all ibc support afsik" and "Good riddance". So that's a key point. Then a_b_c1001 asks who is deprecating and for links. The response from profesija says that existing IBC connections between Wormhole Gateway and affected chains will stay whitelisted, and Wormhole Gateway will continue operating as is. Also, anyone can set up their own frontend and IBC relaying solution. But there's a warning not to worry too much about Osmosis and Wormhole, except for Terra and unknown chains. 

Another message from profesija talks about the cycle of things working for a month or two then not for 1-2 weeks. There's some frustration from fmorency and BasementNodes about lack of follow-up and reliability. 

So the key points are: deprecation of IBC support, Wormhole Gateway's current status remains, alternatives for token transfers, specific concerns about Terra and unknown chains, and the recurring reliability issues. Decisions here might be the deprecation itself and the suggestion to use other solutions. I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without getting bogged down by the repeated support links and the less relevant comments like "Key word here is hole" which seems more like a joke. Also, the user Amareswar8 asking about updates isn't directly related to the main issue, so maybe mention that as a side note. Let me structure this clearly.

**Summary:**  
The discussion centers on the deprecation of IBC support, with **BasementNodes** stating it is being removed entirely. **Profesija** clarifies that existing IBC connections between Wormhole Gateway and affected chains will remain whitelisted, and Wormhole Gateway will continue functioning as is. They also note that users can permissionlessly deploy their own frontends or IBC relaying solutions for token transfers. Concerns are raised about reliability ("works for a month or two, then breaks for 1-2 weeks") and specific risks for Terra and lesser-known chains. Others express frustration over lack of follow-up ("they never worked

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and present them as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key points are.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a repeated link to the support site. That seems like a support resource. Then Amareswar8 is asking about updates or catalysts coming, so that's about project updates or future developments. The next one is osmosis_news sharing a link on X (Twitter), which might relate to announcements or social media updates.

Then there's another statbot message repeating the support site. Jasbanza mentions "Sol joins every day," which I think refers to Solana joining Osmosis daily, maybe about partnerships or integrations. Profesija's first message talks about IBC connections being whitelisted, Wormhole Gateway continuing operations, and mentions Osmosis, Wormhole, Terra, and unknown chains. So topics here are IBC connections, Wormhole Gateway, Terra, and chain interoperability. The second message from profesija mentions the unreliable operation of something, working for a month then not for weeks. That's about service reliability or uptime issues.

Hleb_albau's message says "Key word here is hole," which is a play on words with "Wormhole," so maybe referencing the Wormhole project's vulnerabilities or issues. Fmorency mentions that explains why "they" never followed up, pointing to communication or follow-up problems. BasementNodes comments on IBC support not working well, so criticism of IBC functionality. Then kychuli and a_b_c1001 are asking about who is deprecating IBC support and seeking links, indicating concerns about IBC deprecation and information transparency.

The last two messages from BasementNodes again mention deprecating IBC support and "Good riddance," suggesting opinions on the removal of IBC features. Putting this all together, the main topics are support resources, project updates, social media announcements, IBC connections, Wormhole Gateway, Terra, chain interoperability, service reliability, Wormhole vulnerabilities, communication issues, criticism of IBC functionality, IBC deprecation, and information transparency. I need to make sure these are concise and cover all the points without redundancy.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message in the text and determine its sentiment. The options are positive, negative, or neutral. Let's start from the top.

The first message is from osmosis_statbot providing a support link. It's just a helpful message, so that's neutral. Next, Amareswar8 is asking about updates or catalysts. That's a question seeking information, not expressing emotion, so neutral again.

Then there's an osmosis_news link. Since it's just a URL without any text, I can't determine sentiment here. Maybe neutral? The next osmosis_statbot message is the same as the first, so neutral. Jasbanza mentions "Sol joins every day." That seems positive, like regular participation. So positive there.

Now, profesija's messages. The first one talks about IBC connections continuing and not worrying too much about Osmosis and Wormhole. The key part here is "I would not worry too much," which suggests reassurance, so maybe positive. But they also mention Terra and unknown chains, which could be a slight negative. Hmm, but overall, the sentiment might lean positive because they're advising not to worry. The second profesija message says "It works for a month or two then it does not for 1-2 weeks. Repeat." This indicates inconsistency, which is negative. 

Hleb_albau's message: "Key word here is hole." That's a play on words, pointing out a flaw (hole in Wormhole Gateway). Probably negative. Fmorency says, "that explain why they never followed-up with us!" which shows frustration, so negative. BasementNodes comments "they never worked very well anyway imo" ‚Äì clearly negative. Then another BasementNodes message: "Good riddance" which is positive because it's a relief at something being gone. 

Kychuli's message: "this is the only one i saw" ‚Äì neutral, just stating observation. A_b_c1001 asks for links and thanks, so neutral. The last two BasementNodes messages: one says "Good riddance" (positive) and another states they're deprecating IBC support (neutral factual statement). 

Putting it all together, the sentiments are a mix. The user messages include negative comments about reliability and frustration, but also some positive reactions like relief. The bot messages

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I'll read through each message carefully.

Starting with the first one from osmosis_statbot, they mention visiting the support site if help is needed. That's a recurring message, so maybe it's just a standard support reminder. Not an action item but a resource.

Then Amareswar8 asks about updates or catalysts. That's a question, not an action item. 

Next, osmosis_news shares a link. The content of the link isn't here, but maybe the act of sharing it is part of their role. Not sure if that's an action item for others.

jasbanza says "Sol joins every day." Not sure what that means exactly. Maybe a note about someone named Sol joining daily, but not a clear action item.

Now, profesija's messages. The first one says existing IBC connections between Wormhole Gateway and affected chains will continue to be whitelisted. Then mentions Wormhole Gateway will operate as it does. Also, anyone can set up frontends and IBC relaying solutions. So the key points here are that they're maintaining the whitelist, continuing operations, and encouraging others to set up their own solutions. The last part about not worrying too much about Osmosis and Wormhole but Terra and unknown chains might be a decision or a note for users to focus on those.

Another message from profesija talks about the functionality working for a month or two and then not for 1-2 weeks, repeating. That's more of an observation, not an action item.

hleb_albau's message is a joke about the key word being "hole," probably referencing Wormhole. Not an action item.

fmorency says that explains why they didn't follow up. Again, a comment, not an action.

BasementNodes comments on IBC support not working well and deprecating all IBC support. The deprecation is a decision, but the user is stating their opinion, not an official decision. Wait, but the message from BasementNodes at 05:46:41 says "They are deprecating all ibc support afsik." If "afsik" means "as far as I know," then that's a statement about a decision made by someone (maybe Wormhole or Osmosis). However, I need to check if
