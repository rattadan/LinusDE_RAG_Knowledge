## Source Context
*From: https://www.dydx.xyz/*

### Document Overview  
The content discusses Ethereum's EIP-1559 upgrade, the transition to PoS (Proof of Stake) with the Beacon Chain, staking mechanisms, and the impact of burn rates on ETH's deflationary nature.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **EIP-1559**: Ethereum’s transaction fee mechanism that burns a portion of transaction fees to reduce inflation.  
- **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Ethereum 2.0’s consensus mechanism, replacing PoW.  
- **Beacon Chain**: The PoS layer of Ethereum 2.0, launched in 2022, mirroring Ethereum’s original PoW network.  
- **Staking**: Validators confirm transactions in exchange for rewards, requiring ETH to be locked.  
- **Delegation**: Users stake ETH (below 32 ETH) to join the network, earning rewards without voting rights.  
- **Slashing**: Risk of losing ETH if a validator violates PoS protocol.  
- **Burn Rate**: The amount of ETH burned per day, triggering deflationary effects.  
- **ETH2 (Ethereum 2.0)**: The next-generation blockchain with PoS, under development.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Burn Rate Threshold**: When the burn rate exceeds 1,700 ETH/day, ETH becomes deflationary.  
- **Staking Requirements**: Users must stake 32 ETH to validate transactions on Ethereum, but delegation allows smaller amounts.  
- **Delegation Services**: Third-party providers (e.g., Lido Finance) offer staking pools for ETH2, with delegators receiving rewards but lacking voting rights.  
- **PoS Transition**: Ethereum 2.0 involves five stages: validator selection, stake locking, slashing rules, governance, and finalization.  
- **Eth1 to Eth2**: Users are warned against scams claiming to "upgrade" ETH1 to Eth2, which is not technically feasible.  

### Related Topics  
- **EIP-1559**: The content connects to Ethereum’s fee mechanism, emphasizing its role in reducing inflation.  
- **Ethereum 2.0**: The document references the Beacon Chain and staking processes, linking to broader Ethereum 2.0 documentation.  
- **Staking & Delegation**: The section highlights technical details about validator roles and delegators’ risks, which may align with topics in blockchain governance or security guides.

to the EIP-1559 upgrade in 2021, Ethereum destroys or burns a portion of every transaction fee on the blockchain. Whenever the burn rate on Ethereum 2.0 exceeds 1,700 ETH per day, ETH becomes a deflationary digital asset.

Ethereum 2.0 launched on September 15, 2022, during âThe Merge,â when Ethereumâs execution layer transitioned all its data to a PoS chain called the âBeacon Chain.â Buterin introduced the Beacon Chain in December 2020 as a PoS blockchain mirroring the existing Ethereum PoW network. In the years leading up to The Merge, the Ethereum Foundation let crypto investors stake 32 ETH on the Beacon Chain to support the new blockchainâs decentralization and earn staking rewards.

Although The Merge marked the switch to a PoS consensus, Ethereum 2.0 is still under development. According to Buterin, Ethereum will undergo the following five transitions before completion:

Investors need to stake 32 ETH to validate transactions on Ethereum, but anyone can âdelegateâ below 32 ETH to join the Ethereum 2.0 network. Delegation means depositing a PoS cryptocurrency into a validatorâs staking pool to earn a crypto reward percentage. Many third-party providersââsuch as crypto exchanges, wallets, andDeFi lending sites(e.g., Lido Finance)ââoffer Ethereum 2.0 delegation services. Although ETH delegators wonât enjoy the voting privileges validators get in on-chain governance proposals, they donât have the same responsibilities for confirming transactions. Remember, delegators are at risk of slashing if their validator goes against Ethereumâs PoS protocol. In this scenario, delegators lose all their ETH if the validator they stake with misbehaves or makes an error.

The shift to PoS doesnât affect the code behind Ethereumâs native ETH cryptocurrency. The Ethereum Foundation warns against scammers telling crypto traders âhow to buy Ethereum 2.0 coinsâ or claiming users must upgrade their ETH1 to ETH2.
