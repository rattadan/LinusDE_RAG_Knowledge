Having our own Appchain on Base gives us endless possibilities to expand our service offerings with greater customization and scalability for us and our gaming partners.

Appchains have been a game-changer in helping us build faster, simpler, and more powerful products. With dedicated scalability and support, appchains will allow us to focus on our mission and onchain products.

We utilise blockchain tech to provide verifiable ownership of inventory managed by warehouses and distilleries, along with provenance and auditability. These enterprise customers prioritise performance, security and privacy.

Appchains are for mature projects who want full control over their infrastructure, are seeking scale through dedicated blockspace, and/or are considering custom gas tokens.

We are selecting early access customers off our waitlist. Once approved, you'll get access to both testnet and mainnet features for Base Appchains.

Appchains are a great alternative to launching an altL1 or L2. As an extension of the Base ecosystem, Appchains benefit from Ethereum alignment, co-marketing, liquidity and users of Base Mainnet.

Appchains aims to provide a seamless onboarding between Base. Users will be able to move funds between Base and other Appchains in seconds and will have the ability to provide the same UX as Base applications.

No. Coinbase hosts the core infrastructure of Appchains and secures associated private keys on your behalf.
