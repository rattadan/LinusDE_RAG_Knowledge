| messages | @dieterthemieter @Darky1k For one.. must be that we provide GPU access for all, seamlessly payable in crypto. Also later on autonomous agentic access to COMPUT3, for scaling on agent's demand. Ask @nedos on coming livestreams..ðŸ§  But also super curious to hear from you! Any feature + model requests/ |
