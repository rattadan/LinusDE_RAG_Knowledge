The study focuses on the development and analysis of welfare-optimal operations for these emerging mobility solutions, emphasizing external cost pricing and system efficiency. 
Key Themes: 

     

    Innovative Mobility Concepts: 
         The document explores the potential of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and dynamic transport services to address challenges in traditional transportation systems, such as traffic congestion, environmental impact, and inefficiencies in public transit.
         Shared mobility services, including shared taxis and ride-sharing platforms, are analyzed for their ability to optimize resource allocation and reduce costs.
         
     

    Simulation-Based Analysis: 
         The study employs agent-based simulation tools (e.g., MATSim) to model transportation systems and evaluate the performance of dynamic vehicle routing algorithms.
         Synthetic demand modeling and open data are used to create realistic scenarios for testing these concepts in urban environments, such as Berlin.
         
     

    Dynamic Transport Services: 
         The research highlights the importance of dynamic routing and real-time optimization in improving the efficiency of transportation services. This includes balancing supply (vehicle fleets) and demand (user requests) to minimize waiting times and maximize service coverage.
         External cost pricing is introduced as a mechanism to internalize the costs of environmental and social impacts, ensuring a more welfare-optimal allocation of resources.
         
     

    Key Findings: 
         The study demonstrates that dynamic vehicle routing algorithms can significantly improve system performance by optimizing routes in real-time, reducing empty running, and enhancing service availability.
         The size of the vehicle fleet and pricing strategies play critical roles in determining the efficiency and sustainability of shared mobility services.
         User behavior, including willingness to share rides or wait for vehicles, also influences the overall effectiveness of these systems.
         
     

    Conclusion: 
         The document underscores the potential benefits of integrating shared autonomous vehicles into urban transportation networks, provided that appropriate policies and pricing mechanisms are in place.
         It emphasizes the need for further research and validation of these concepts through large-scale simulations and real-world pilot studies.

user prices which may boost the demand for such innovative on-demand mobility services. Operators of on-demand
mobility services need guidance on how to change their today’s service in order to increase their profit, increase the
number of DRT users or reach a predefined level of service quality. In contrast, municipalities may need guidance on
how to regulate the existing DRT services in order to improve overall system welfare or follow a political agenda, e.g.
a modal shift from private cars to environmental friendlier modes. This study investigates how the design of the DRT
service area and pricing scheme may affect transport users’ travel behavior.
2. Methodology
2.1. Agent-based transport simulation framework
MATSim overview. The proposed optimization approach uses the agent-based and dynamic transport simulation
framework MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation, see www.matsim.org) [6]. In MATSim, each transport user
is modeled as an individual agent. Transport demand adapts to the transport supply (road network, SAV availability,
tolls, fares) applying an evolutionary iterative approach involving the following three steps:
1. The traffic flow is simulated. DRT vehicles and other road users interact on the same network applying a queue
model which accounts for dynamic congestion and spill-back effects.
2. Each agent evaluates his/her daily (travel) behavior taking into consideration (i) the time spent performing an
activity and (ii) travel-related costs, e.g. mode-specific fixed cost and travel time costs, tolls, fares.
3. The agents are enabled to adjust their travel behavior. They can switch to another mode of transportation, adjust
their routes or change their departure time. In this study, changes in location choice are neglected.
MATSim DRT module. The simulation of on-demand mobility services in MATSim uses an existing module for
dynamic vehicle routing problems [10, 11] and an existing module for the simulation of DRT [2]. Agents using DRT
walk to the next virtual DRT stop (there is one stop on each car network link in the service area) and request a DRT ride
when they arrive at the stop. The ride request is then assigned to a DRT vehicle which can serve it while maintaining
certain service quality constraints for the new passenger and the passengers already scheduled to use that vehicle. The
overall passenger to vehicle assignment heuristic strives to minimize the total vehicle operation time spent on serving
ride requests. If the DRT system is congested and no DRT vehicle can serve the ride request within the service quality
constraints, the request is not rejected but assigned to the vehicle which can serve it with the least additional operation
time ignoring the service quality criteria. After arriving at the destination stop, the agent walks to the destination.
2.2. DRT speed up
To speed up the simulation experiments, in this study, an approximation approach is developed which is somewhat
similar to the approach by [4]. In contrast to [4], the proposed approximation approach accounts for the specific
characteristics of the DRT module (for example the DRT pricing scheme) and only approximates the DRT mode,
whereas, all other modes are simulated without any modification. During the first n iterations, the DRT mode is only
simulated in detail every k iterations. In between these iterations, the DRT mode is simulated in a simplified way
without running the assignment of DRT vehicles and users on the network. Instead, user costs are approximated as
follows:
• The DRT trip travel time is calculated based on the beeline distance and an average beeline speed which is obtained from the detailed DRT simulation. The average beeline speed is updated every k iterations and considers
the time passengers spend inside the DRT vehicles as well as the time passengers spend waiting for a DRT
vehicle.
• The DRT trip fare is computed in the same way as in the detailed simulation. For the distance-related fare,
the DRT trip distance is calculated based on the beeline distance and an average beeline distance factor which
is obtained from the detailed DRT simulation. The average beeline distance is updated every k iterations and
considers the network layout and actual distance driven by DRT vehicles.

In this study, k is set to 10 iterations, and n is set to 0.7, that is, for the final 150 iterations, the DRT speed up is
disabled. The approximation approach may easily be improved, e.g. by computing differentiated averages by time
of day or origin-destination-relation. The DRT-speed-up program code used in this study is publicly available on
https://github.com/matsim-vsp/drt-speed-up (release v0.0.1).
3. Case study and simulation experiments
Case study: Greater Berlin area. The transport network contains all roads and public transit lines in the Greater
Berlin area. Travel demand consists of work and non-work trips by car, public transit, bicycle, ride and walk mode.
The synthetic population is calibrated against real-world traffic data, i.e. car counts, modal split [8] and trip-distances
[1]. To improve computational performance, in this study, a 10% sample is used and the DRT fleet size and road
capacities are accordingly reduced. A detailed description of the applied case study is provided in Ziemke et al. [13].
The Berlin case study which is used in this study is publicly available on https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsimberlin (development branch 5.5.x, commit 7c5c791).
Simulation setup. The DRT mode is added to the existing modes of transportation and may be used for trips starting
and ending within the service area. Agents are also allowed to walk a maximum distance of 2 km to get from outside
the service area to the DRT pick-up point, or the other way round, from the drop-off point inside the service area to
their trip destination outside the service area. A trip request starting and/or ending outside the range of 2 km walking
distance to or from the service area will not be served and the agent is forced to use the walk mode for the entire trip.
Vehicle capacities are set to a maximum of 4 passengers and the DRT service allows for pooling (ride-sharing). The
DRT fleet size is set to fixed number of 10,000 vehicles (1,000 vehicles for the 10% sample). In the first iteration,
all vehicles are randomly distributed in the inner-city Berlin area. Then, vehicles remain on the link where the last
drop-off took place. The pick-up and drop-off duration is set to 1 minute. DRT vehicles interact with each other as well
as with private cars and trucks (dynamic congestion). Travel times within public transport (PT) mode result from
walking times from and to the transit stop, waiting times and in-vehicle times based on the schedule. In this simulation
setup, buses and tramways do not interact with DRT vehicles, private cars or bicycles. The walk, bicycle and ride
mode are simulated in a simplified way, i.e. teleported from one activity to the next one. That is, transport users do
not interact with each other or users of other modes. For walk and bicycle, the travel times are computed based on
a mode-specific speed (walk: 4 km/h; bicycle: 12 km/h) and a trip distance resulting from the beeline distance and a
beeline distance factor (walk: 1.5; bicycle: 1.4). For ride, the travel time is computed based on the least cost network
route taking into consideration the congested car travel time.
Choice dimensions. All transport users are allowed to change their transport routes, departure times and modes of
transportation. For each sub-tour, i.e. trip chains starting and ending at the same activity location, the transport mode
may be changed to only car, only bicycle (chain-based modes) or a combination of public transit, DRT and walk for
each trip within the sub-tour. The ride mode is fixed, i.e. transport users are not enabled to switch from or to the ride
mode. In this study, intermodal trips are not accounted for. Each agent’s choice sets is limited to 5 travel plans. All
simulation experiments are run for a total of 500 iterations. During choice set generation (first 400 iterations), in each
iteration the share of agents who change their mode, route and departure time (innovative strategies) is set to 5% per
choice dimension. In the final 100 iterations, all agents select from their choice sets based on a multinomial logit
model. Utility parameters for the different modes are set similar to [9].
Simulation experiments. In different simulation experiments, the DRT mode is added as an additional mode of transportation as described in Sec. 3 and the DRT service area is either set to (1) the inner-city Berlin area or (2) the entire
Berlin area. The DRT fare is set to a distance-based fare of 0.35 EUR/km, and the minimum fee is set to (a) 0.00,
(b) 2.00 or (c) 3.00 EUR. All simulation experiments are carried out for two pricing schemes for the car mode: i) no
tolling and ii) with a toll of 0.20 EUR/km. The toll is only imposed on car users and does not affect to DRT vehicles
or DRT users. The simulation results are compared to the base case continued in which there is no DRT mode and no
car toll.

Using the DRT speed up module has a significant impact on the computational performance. In iterations where the
DRT mode is simulated in a simplified way, the computation time is reduced by approx. 30-60 minutes per iteration
compared to the detailed simulation (every 10th iteration), depending on the total number of simulated DRT users (see
Fig. 1a). Also, as shown in Fig. 1b, there is no significant change in the mode shares before and after disabling the
speed up approach in iteration 350. The jump in iteration 400 is explained by switching off the innovative strategies
(disabling choice set generation).

4.2. Travel time and travel distance
Tab. 1 and 2 provide the average DRT travel time and average DRT trip distance for each simulation experiment. As
expected, increasing the minimum fee makes the DRT mode less attractive for short distance trips which is indicated
by an increase in average travel time and average travel distance. Also, expanding the DRT service area from the
inner-city area to the entire Berlin area allows for longer trips and yields an increase in average travel time and
average travel distance. For users switching from car to DRT, the average beeline travel speed is observed to decrease

and the average travel time increases. In contrast, for all users switching from PT, bicycle and walk to the DRT mode,
the average beeline speed increases and the average travel time decreases.
4.3. Mode shift effects
Fig. 2 and 3 provide the absolute numbers of DRT trips as well as the modes of transportation which would have
been chosen in the case without the DRT mode and without the car toll (base case continued). Fig. 2 provides the
outcome for the simulation experiments in which the service area is set to the inner-city Berlin area. Fig. 3 provides
the outcome for the simulation experiments in which the service area is set to the entire Berlin area. For each service
area setup, simulation results are given for different pricing schemes.
Without car tolling. The total number of DRT trips strongly depends on the pricing setup as well as the service area.
For the minimum fee of 3 EUR, expanding the service area approx. increases the number of residents inside
the service area by a factor of 4, but increases the number of DRT trips by a factor of 10. For the other pricing

5

schemes, the number of DRT trips increases to a lesser extent, which is explained by the limited number of available
DRT vehicles (see in particular 3a). The DRT vehicle fleet size is set to a fixed number of 10,000 vehicles in all
simulation experiments. DRT vehicles operating at the capacity limit yields long waiting times for some DRT users
who will eventually prefer a different mode of transportation. Depending on the service area and pricing scheme, the
DRT trip share of all trips in the Berlin area ranges from 0.04% (DRT service area: inner-city Berlin area; Minimum
fare: 3.00 EUR) to 4.9% (DRT service area: entire Berlin area; Minimum fee: 0 EUR). A comparison of the modal
shift effect for the different pricing setups reveals that without a minimum charge, most DRT users come from the
bicycle and walk mode. Without a minimum charge, for both service area setups, only a share of 4% switch from
car to DRT. Charging a minimum fee has a significant effect on the total number of DRT trips as well as the modal
shift: For a higher minimum fee, the number of users switching from bicycle and walk to the DRT mode is
drastically reduced. And instead, users switching from PT to DRT is observed to be the strongest modal shift effect.
Nevertheless, even for a relatively high minimum fee, a significant share of DRT users come from the bicycle and
walk mode. The DRT service area is found to have a strong impact on the modal shift between car and DRT. In the
setup where DRT vehicles only operate inside the inner-city Berlin area, increasing the minimum fee does not increase
the share of users switching from car to DRT. In contrast, a larger DRT service area increases the modal shift from
car to DRT. The setup in which DRT vehicles operate inside the entire Berlin area, a higher minimum fee translates
into a higher share of users switching from car to DRT. Nevertheless, the share of users switching from car to DRT is
rather minor compared to the number of users switching from PT to DRT.

The effect of imposing a toll on car users. Implementing the DRT service and imposing a toll of 0.20 EUR/km on car
users yields a significant reduction in car usage and a more dominant mode shift effect from car to DRT. As shown
in Fig. 2d and 3d, more than a third of all DRT users come from the car mode. The car trip share in the Berlin area
decreases by approx. 12% (minimum DRT fee: 3 EUR), and PT, bicycle, walk and DRT trip shares increase.
1 The number of DRT trips is limited by the fleet size which is fixed to 10,000 vehicles. Additional simulation experiments which are carried out
to investigate the impact of the fleet size indicate that a fleet of 20,000 vehicles results in approx. 1 million DRT trips, and an even larger fleet size
of 100,000 vehicles motivates additional users to switch to the DRT mode, resulting in a total of approx. 1.5 million DRT trips.

5. Conclusion and Outlook
For Berlin, the simulation results have shown that a small service area and too low prices may result in an unwanted
mode shift effect from walk and bicycle to DRT. In order to design a DRT concept which yields a reduction in car trips,
the service area should not be limited to the city-center area, and rather cover a typical commuting area. In addition,
the pricing scheme should have a relatively high minimum fee in order to make the DRT mode less attractive for shortdistance travelers who may as well walk or take the bicycle without facing any high additional costs. The simulation
experiments have also shown that even for a city-wide DRT service area and a minimum fee of 3.00 EUR, without
car tolling only 11% of the DRT users are shifted from the car mode. With car tolling, the simulation experiments
yield a larger share of users switching from car to DRT. Similar to the finding in [see, e.g., 9], this highlights the
importance to combine ’pull’ measures (introducing DRT as a new mode of transportation) with ’push’ measures,
such as, implementing a road pricing scheme, increasing parking costs or banning private vehicles in certain areas. In
several simulation experiments, even for a city-wide DRT and a minimum fee, a significant share of DRT users come
from the PT mode. From the user perspective, this indicates a positive effect since users switching from PT to DRT
experience a reduced travel time and obtain a higher utility.
Future studies will address service concepts which aim at a desired mode shift effect. The simulation setup will
also be extended to account for intermodal trips, in particular the combination of PT and DRT which is expected to
have a positive effect on the modal shift from car to PT and/or DRT. Furthermore the base case will be extended by
other modes of transportation, such as car sharing and conventional taxis, which are also highly relevant for the modal
shift towards DRT.
