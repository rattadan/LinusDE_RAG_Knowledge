## Overview

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 5 keywords or tags for better postprocessing, based on the provided Twitter posts. The response needs to be concise and focused on the most distinctive patterns.

First, I need to scan through the tweets to identify recurring themes or topics. Let's see:

1. The main themes seem to be Bitcoin's performance, regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and company actions (like MicroStrategy and Jai Hind). Also, there's mention of government policies, like the US Treasury report and the BITCOIN Act.

2. Key terms that stand out: "Bitcoin's performance," "Regulatory developments," "Macro trends," "Company actions," "Government policies." These are all recurring topics in the tweets.

3. The user wants keywords that are distinctive. So, I should pick the most frequent and impactful ones. "Bitcoin's performance" is mentioned multiple times, as is "Regulatory developments." "Macro trends" and "Company actions" are also frequent. "Government policies" is another key area.

4. Need to make sure the keywords are distinct but cover the main topics. Let me check if any of these are too similar. "Bitcoin's performance" and "Macro trends" are related but distinct. "Regulatory developments" and "Government policies" are also distinct. "Company actions" is specific to financial institutions.

5. Final list: "Bitcoin's Performance," "Regulatory Developments," "Macro Trends," "Company Actions," "Government Policies." These cover the main themes and are distinct enough for postprocessing.
