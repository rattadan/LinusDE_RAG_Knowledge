## Eureka - Chunk 8

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Asset Issuers - ensuring the assets you care about being bridged over Eureka are properly set up in the protocol and in the Skip Go API for application developers to support easily. Application Developers - ensuring your end users have access to Eureka assets and bridging capabilities via the Skip Go API. ​
Chain Developers
If you’re developing a Cosmos-based blockchain, the easiest way to unlock Eureka assets and bridging capabilities is by opening up an IBC connection to the Cosmos Hub:

Requires an IBC (classic) connection to the Cosmos Hub
No chain upgrade is needed if you’re already using IBC
Users benefit from reduced cost of asset transfers between Eureka-enabled domains through batching
Chains only need to maintain a single relayer to the Cosmos Hub to reach the entire Eureka and IBC network
If you are interested in a direct Eureka connection to Ethereum or L2s/Solana coming later this year, please reach out to Jeremy or Susannah directly as additional integration work is required.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk appears to be an excerpt from a document that provides an overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol) - a protocol used for cross-chain asset transfers, which can experience timeouts or slippage.
* Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol) - another protocol that also experiences similar issues with timeouts and slippage.
* Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP) - relies on Circle's attestation service, which can be unavailable leading to funds being inaccessible.
* Hyperlane - a secure protocol secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
* Go Fast - a timed-based system that ensures users do not lose their assets if transactions fail independently.

**Context and Connection:**

The text chunk connects to the surrounding context of a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. This document likely aims to provide guidance on mitigating risks associated with these protocols, which are commonly used for transferring assets between different blockchain networks. The specific focus on IBC, Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast protocols indicates that the technical details and parameters mentioned in this chunk are likely related to these respective protocols.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

* Users need to be aware of potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
* Developers must implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.
* Chain developers require an IBC connection to the Cosmos Hub for Eureka-enabled domains.
* Integration work is required for direct connections between Eureka-enabled domains, Ethereum, or L2s/Solana.

By analyzing this specific section, we can understand that it provides technical details and parameters related to various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. It also connects to the surrounding context of a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in these protocols, aiming to provide guidance on mitigating risks associated with them.
