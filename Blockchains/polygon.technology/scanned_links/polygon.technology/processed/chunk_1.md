# Documentation Analysis - Chunk chunk_1.txt

## Source Context
*From: https://polygon.technology/*

### Document Overview  
This content outlines Polygon's ecosystem, including its Chain Development Kit (CDK), wallets (Phantom, Unstoppable Domains), blockchain projects (Miden, Agglayer), and financial metrics, while emphasizing its role as a scalable, secure Web3 platform.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Chain Development Kit (CDK)**: A tool for building Layer 1 blockchain applications on Polygon, supporting multiple layers (OP Stack, zkEVM, Miden).  
- **zkEVM (Zcash EVM)**: A Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, enabling fast, secure transactions.  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Polygon’s consensus mechanism for its blockchain networks.  
- **Unstoppable Domains**: A domain registration service for Web3 identity.  
- **Agglayer**: A liquidity aggregation platform for DeFi.  
- **Miden**: A Layer 1 blockchain project built on Polygon’s zkEVM.  
- **Phantom Wallet**: A secure, user-friendly wallet for NFTs and DeFi.  
- **Polygon PoS**: A scalable, permissionless consensus mechanism.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Live Versions**: Polygon PoSLive and Polygon zkEVMLive are operational, with Miden in development.  
- **CDK Multistack**: The CDK supports multiple blockchain layers (OP Stack, zkEVM, Miden) for flexible deployment.  
- **Miden Funding**: Raised $25M from investors to build a blockchain for edge computing.  
- **Agglayer Events**: Scheduled for ETHDenver and Cryptos Premier Conference, highlighting liquidity aggregation.  
- **Financial Metrics**: Polygon’s user base (28K+, 219.11M+ addresses, 2.44B+ transactions), and $0.015 in value.  

### Related Topics  
- **CDK Multistack**: Linked to the CDK’s live deployment and technical specifications.  
- **Miden Project**: Connected to the $25M funding and its edge blockchain focus.  
- **Agglayer Events**: Noted as a key event in the documentation, tying to the CDK and other projects.  
- **Stripe Integration**: Highlighted as a real-world use case for Polygon PoS.
