**Original Text:**

For alighting stops, the unloading of bulky baggage, the number of passengers involved
and the kind of stop location are significant variables, while for boarding stops, the delay of
passengers and luggage storage lead to an extensive increase in stop time. Therefore, we
recommend applying the provided log-logistic functions to represent a realistic distribution
of ridepooling stop times in future simulation models. Acknowledgements
