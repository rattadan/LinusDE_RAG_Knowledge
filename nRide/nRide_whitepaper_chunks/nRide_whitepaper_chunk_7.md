This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

By following this sequence, riders and drivers can efficiently communicate with each
other, agree on the details of the ride, and ensure a safe and reliable experience. 2.2.1. Request
Passengers can initiate a ride request by broadcasting a "Request" message to nearby drivers. The message
contains several pieces of information, including a unique ID for the request and the coordinates of the
pickup and destination points. These pieces of information allow drivers to quickly and easily identify the
ride request and determine whether they are able to accept it. -3Additionally, the "Request" message may include a raw "data" field that can be used to encode arbitrary information. This field may be used to include additional information about the ride request, such as the passengerâ€™s profile information or any special instructions for the driver. Request {
String id;
String source;
double startLat;
double startLon;
String startAddress;
double endLat;
double endLon;
String endAddress;
[]byte data;
}
