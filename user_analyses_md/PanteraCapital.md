The keywords should be relevant to the content, like "crypto market fundamentals," "long-term bullish," "market analysis," "Pantera Capital," and "investment strategies."

I need to make sure the response is concise and meets all the user's requirements. Also, generate 5 tags that capture the essence of the tweets. Let me check if I missed anything.
