## Chunk 11

**Original Text:**

(2014) and Daganzo (1978) is employed to approximate the components of the operating cost of the DRT system: fleet size, total vehicle hours traveled (VHT), and total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network. Given the service area of the DRT system, these components of the agency cost can be approximated as functions of the number of waiting passengers that have requested service and the maximum rate that operators can serve passengers per time (i.e., operating capacity). The total operating cost for the agency can be estimated as a linear combination of these components (Rahimi et al., 2014). In addition to the expenses to the agency for running the service, it is also necessary to account for the costs that users endure to use the service. To this end, Vickrey's (1969) congestion theory is adapted to approximate the costs that the DRT users experience for the service when the operating capacity of the system is inadequate to meet the demand.
