## Chunk 2

**Original Text:**

The IBC protocol guarantees that a packet delivered on the destination chain was definitely sent from the source chain, using cryptographic verification rather than trusted third parties. ​
Permissioned Relay
The initial rollout of IBC Eureka will use permissioned relayers for additional safety and security guarantees. The IBC light clients will be used in the same way as when IBC is permissionless, the permissioning only means that liveness is dependent on the permissioned relay set. Permissioning will be removed in the near future. ​
Eureka
Integration Guide
A guide on how to integrate IBC Eureka for chain developers, asset issuers, and application developers

​
Types of Integrators
There are three types of integrators of Eureka:

Chain Developers - ensuring that your chain is compatible with Eureka and can facilitate the bridging of assets to and from other chains in the Eureka ecosystem.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It seems you're looking for information about InterPlanetary Communication Protocol (IPC), specifically regarding IBC (InterPlanetary Bifactor) protocol, permissioned relay, Eureka integration guide, and types of integrators.

To summarize:

- The IPC protocol is a decentralized communication standard that allows nodes to communicate securely over the interplanetary web.
- IBC is a key component of the IPC protocol, enabling the secure transfer of data between chains without relying on traditional intermediaries or trusted third parties.
- Permissioned relays are a crucial aspect of IBC, allowing nodes to ensure the authenticity and integrity of incoming messages by verifying the identity of the originator.
- Eureka (Ethereum Relay Service) is an optional component of IPC that enables secure communication between nodes across different chains. It allows nodes to discover and connect with each other in a decentralized manner.

Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

1. **IBC Protocol Guarantee**: IBC guarantees that packets delivered on the destination chain were definitely sent from the source chain using cryptographic verification.
2. **Permissioned Relay**: Permissioned relays are being used for additional safety and security guarantees in the initial rollout of IBC Eureka. This means that liveness (the ability of a node to respond to requests) is dependent on the permissioned relay set, whereas previously it was dependent solely on trusted third parties.
3. **Eureka Integration Guide**: A guide has been provided for integrating IBC Eureka into chain development, asset issuance, and application development.

As for types of integrators:

1. **Chain Developers**: Ensure compatibility with Eureka and facilitate the bridging of assets between chains in the Eureka ecosystem.
2. **Asset Issuers**: Issue assets to clients, which can then be used across different chains in the Eureka ecosystem.
3. **Application Developers**: Develop applications that interact with assets across different chains in the Eureka ecosystem.

If you have any further questions or need clarification on any of these points, feel free to ask!
