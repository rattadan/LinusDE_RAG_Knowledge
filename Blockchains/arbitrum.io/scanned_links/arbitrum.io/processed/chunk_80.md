Offchain Labs should be sent to 252 Nassau Street, Floor 2, Princeton, New Jersey 08542 (Notice Address). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Offchain Labs and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Offchain Labs may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Offchain Labs or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Offchain Labs is entitled.
- Arbitration ProceduresArbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations (AAA) rules and procedures, including the AAAs Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the AAA Rules), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAAs consumer arbitration page,https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law.
