Thus, comparing research results that adopt different stop time assumptions
becomes challenging. Methodology
Delimitation of terms
Elucidating the distinct time phases within a PUDO event, we first established our definition
of stop time in the context of a stop maneuver for a ridepooling PUDO event. This explicit
description is illustrated in Figure 1. Stop time is defined as the entire duration during which
the vehicle maintains a velocity of 0 km/h. The times for braking and acceleration dynamics
are excluded since we aim to provide a stop time parameter for future simulation models
where the vehicle’s driving behaviour is already integrated. The dwell process itself is considered as part of the stop time. Therefore, the dwell time is defined as the period when the
vehicle’s door is open, encompassing all passenger activities as well as the door’s opening
and closing processes (Dueker et al. 2004; Harmann et al. 2024).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk focuses on:

1. **Technical details**: The definition of stop time in the context of a ride-pooling PUDO event, which involves determining the duration during which the vehicle maintains a velocity of 0 km/h.
2. **Contextual connection**: This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by establishing its relevance to ride-pooling services and urban transport systems, specifically highlighting the importance of stop time in defining operational aspects of these services.
3. **Specific requirements or conditions**:
	* The definition of stop time is crucial for accurately modeling and simulating ride-pooling scenarios.
	* The exclusion of braking and acceleration dynamics from stop time calculation ensures a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's behavior during the dwell process.
	* The inclusion of dwell time as part of the stop time parameter provides a more nuanced understanding of the system.

This chunk is explaining how to establish and define stop time in ride-pooling PUDO events, which is essential for accurately modeling and simulating these systems. It connects to the broader context by highlighting the importance of stop time in defining operational aspects of ride-pooling services and urban transport systems.
