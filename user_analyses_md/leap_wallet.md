The main themes are blockchain, NFTs, and decentralized finance.

Next, the language style and tone. The tweets are casual, using emojis like üê∞ and üê∏, and phrases like "Mammoth Mode" and "testnet is back." The tone is upbeat and encouraging, with a lot of enthusiasm and a call to action.

Key characteristics of communication: The user is likely using a promotional and persuasive tone, emphasizing community and participation. They might be targeting users interested in blockchain and decentralized apps.

The ecosystem or project they advertise is Leap Wallet itself, but they also mention other projects like Celestia, MetaMask, and MegaETH. So, the main ecosystem is Leap Wallet, but they collaborate with others.
