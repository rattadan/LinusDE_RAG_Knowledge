## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided chat messages.

First, I'll go through each message to identify the main topics. There's a lot here, so I need to group similar discussions. 

Starting with the top, there's a support message from osmosis_statbot. Then ndcast has some comments about macOS inefficiency and a humorous message about age. But since the user is asking about Osmosis, maybe those are just off-topic and can be skipped unless relevant. 

Looking further down, micmacmicmac asks about when the token burn stops. Kychuli responds that it's tied to arbitrage gains, not swap fees, and links to a forum discussion on overriding Prop 710. That's important for the tokenomics. 

Then there's an issue with Cosmostation wallet and a suggestion to use Keplr. Technical support stuff, but maybe not a key decision. 

Sirwenalot brings up transaction fees, suggesting they should be increased because they're too low, leading to wasted funds. He mentions a possible pre-proposal discussion with validators. Also talks about a trading competition to boost activity and burns. This seems like a proposal or decision point.

Khuwarzmi provides data on burned OSMO tokens, links to revenue details, and explains that taker fees (2-3%) and inflation contribute to APR. He also mentions sharing on the forum, so governance and revenue sources are key here.

Another user, ecazaroto, asks about APR breakdown, which Khuwarzmi addresses with the 2-3% from fees and the rest from inflation. 

Putting this together, the main topics are token burning mechanics, transaction fee adjustments, governance proposals, revenue sources affecting APR, and wallet issues. 

I need to highlight decisions like the token burn linked to arbitrage, the discussion on increasing fees, the trading competition idea, and the APR composition. Also mention the support links and resources provided. 

Make sure to exclude the off-topic messages about macOS and the age joke. Focus on Osmosis-related info. Check for any other key points I might have missed. 

Yes, the user's summary should include the burning mechanism, fee proposals, governance links, APR details, and wallet troubleshooting. Keep it concise, bullet points maybe. Avoid technical jargon but stay accurate.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, so I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand what each message is about.

First, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That seems like a support or help topic. Then ndcast has a few messages. One talks about macOS for NARA, another about being 69 years old with 420 days left, which might be a personal comment. The third ndcast message is about the inefficiency of macOS users, specifically regarding having to click to see sub-apps instead of having them separate. This seems related to user interface or user experience issues on macOS.

Next, kychuli mentions that fees from arbitrage are burned, not swapping fees. There's a link to a breakdown. Then another message from kychuli about overriding a proposal (prop 710) and links to documentation and a forum discussion. This looks like governance or token burn policies. The user micmacmicmac is asking about when the token burn will stop, which relates to tokenomics and burn schedule.

Another kychuli message shares a link to Keplr wallet, and there's a discussion about Cosmostation errors when connecting a mobile wallet. That's about wallet integration issues. Then there's a session error message when trying to swap using Osmo, which could be technical issues or transaction errors.

The osmosis_statbot again mentions the support site. Khuwarzmi's messages include welcoming someone, offering testnet OSMO, directing to a faucet, and providing links to check OSMO burned amounts and APR details. These relate to testnet tokens, faucets, and staking rewards.

Sirwenalot discusses transaction fees, suggesting they should be higher, mentions a trading competition, and burning mechanisms affecting inflation. Topics here are transaction fees, governance proposals, and token burn impact on inflation.

Another user asks about the percentage of APR from real yield versus newly minted tokens, which is about staking rewards breakdown.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be:

- Token burn mechanisms and schedules
- Transaction fees and their efficiency
- Wallet integration issues (like Cosmostation and Keplr)
- Staking rewards and APR breakdown
- Governance proposals (like overriding prop 710)
- User interface inefficiencies in macOS
- Testnet OSM

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people, and I need to determine the overall sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll go through each message one by one. Starting with the top, there's a message from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's just a neutral, informational message. Then ndcast has a few messages. The first one mentions "all that mac os for nara" which might be a typo, but not sure. The next one is about being 69 with 420 days to live, which sounds negative. The third ndcast message is a rant about Mac users' inefficiency, which is definitely negative. 

Then there's kychuli and micmacmicmac discussing token burns and fees. These seem neutral, just factual or asking questions. The next part is about Cosmostation errors and using Keplr, which shows frustration, so negative. The messages about SquidRouter and transaction fees being low are also negative. 

Looking further down, Sirwenalot is talking about transaction fees being too low and suggesting increasing them, which is a negative sentiment towards the current state. Khuwarzmi provides some stats on APR and burned tokens, which are neutral. The last few messages are about technical issues and errors, which are negative.

So the majority of the messages are either neutral (providing information or links) or negative (complaining about errors, inefficiencies, transaction issues). There are very few positive messages. The user might be testing if I can pick out the negative sentiments amidst the neutral ones. The overall sentiment here seems negative because of the multiple complaints and frustrations expressed by different users. Even though some messages are neutral, the presence of several negative ones tips the balance.
</think>

The sentiment of the text is **negative**.  

### Key reasons:  
1. **Frustration with technical issues**: Multiple users report errors (e.g., "transaction error," "session not established," "low fee error") and criticize inefficiencies in tools like Cosmostation and Mac OS.  
2. **Criticism of system design**: Complaints about transaction fees ("too low," leading to wasted funds) and user interface inefficiencies ("1 click = 1 sec" wasted time).  
3. **Concerns about tokenomics**: Questions about indefinite token burns and dissatisfaction with revenue distribution

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I need to understand what each part of the conversation is about. The text is a series of chat messages from different users, some of which might be asking questions, providing information, or suggesting actions.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a link to the support site. That's probably just a general help message, so maybe not an action item. Then ndcast has some messages about Mac OS inefficiency, which seems more like a complaint rather than an action item. The user is ranting about how Mac users have to click more, but there's no specific request or decision here.

Next, kychuli and micmacmicmac are discussing token burns related to OSMO. micmacmac asks when the token burn will end, and kychuli explains that it's tied to a proposal and provides links. So here, the action item might be that micmacmac needs to check the provided links for information. Also, kychuli mentions that the burn won't stop unless a proposal overrides it, so maybe there's a need to look into that proposal or participate in governance.

Then there's a conversation about Cosmostation wallet issues. Ibreaktwo is having trouble with a transaction error, and kychuli suggests using Keplr instead. The action item here is for Ibreaktwo to try using Keplr wallet to resolve the error.

Looking further, there's a user named user_7164487109 asking for a faucet because the website isn't working. Khuwarzmi tells them to DM their address, and divya_in mentions sending a message to David. So action items here might be that Khuwarzmi needs to direct the user to send their address, and divya_in should ask David to check DMs.

Sirwenalot has several messages discussing transaction fees and burning. They suggest increasing fees and having a trading competition. These are more like proposals or suggestions, so possible action items could be to contact validators about a pre-proposal or to consider organizing a trading competition.

Khuwarzmi provides some data on burned OSMO tokens and links to check APR details. Then ecazaroto asks about the APR breakdown. Khuwarzmi says they'll check, so that's an action item to follow up on that query.
