Putting these tweets in context:
The author appears to be positioning themselves as someone who understands Bitcoin's long-term trajectory and wants to highlight what they see as inevitable adoption trends. The tweets about falling Bitcoin supply on exchanges and the growing sector of companies following $MSTR's Bitcoin treasury strategy suggest they want to build a narrative of Bitcoin's increasing scarcity and institutional acceptance. The tweet about career risk implies they see crypto/blockchain as a revolutionary technology that professionals must embrace or risk being left behind. The minimalistic tweet with just an emoji ðŸ™Œ suggests they understand the value of engagement and emotional appeal alongside data-driven analysis.
