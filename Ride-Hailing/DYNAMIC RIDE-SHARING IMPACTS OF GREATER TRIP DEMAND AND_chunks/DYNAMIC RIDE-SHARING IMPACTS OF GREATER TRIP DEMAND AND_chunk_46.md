## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 46

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

The specific technical details mentioned in this chunk are:

* Dynamic Ride-Sharing: a simulation study (Agatz et al., 2011)
* On-demand high-capacity ride-sharing via dynamic trip-vehicle assignment: Alonso-Mora et al. (2017)
* POLARIS: Agent-based modeling framework development and implementation for integrated travel demand and network and operations simulations

**Processes and Connection to Surrounding Context:**

This chunk is building upon the surrounding context of a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports on shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems. The current text chunk specifically mentions specific studies in this field (Agatz et al., 2011; Alonso-Mora et al., 2017) that focus on simulation studies and agent-based modeling frameworks.

The connection to the surrounding context is implicit but clear: the references provided are a selection of academic papers that contribute to our understanding of shared autonomous vehicle systems, their potential applications, and the challenges associated with them. The text chunk is likely to be part of an introduction or overview section that provides a foundation for exploring these topics further.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

None mentioned in this specific section. However:

* The timeframe spanned by the references (2014-2020) suggests that the authors are working within a relatively recent period.
* The authors' involvement as "Key authors" implies a level of expertise and credibility in the field.
* The use of academic citations and DOIs indicates a focus on peer-reviewed, scholarly literature.
