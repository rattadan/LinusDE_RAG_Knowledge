## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, I need to extract the main topics from this text and present them as a comma-separated list. Let me start by going through the messages to see what's being discussed.

First, there's a lot of mention of cryptocurrencies like Cosmos (ATOM), Juno (JUNO), Dymension (DYM), Saga (SAGA), Penumbra (UM), and some others. Terms like "pump," "mcap," "alt season," and "airdrop" come up often. People are talking about buying, selling, and market strategies, like "scaling out of meme" or "MEV bots." There's a game called "Lucky 7" where users pick numbers between 1-49, which might be a lottery or casino reference.

Some messages mention influencers and their roles in promoting coins, like TommiMoontana's calls. There's a discussion about scams, bans, and mutes in the Telegram group. The user "AJ" is mentioned a lot, with people talking about his alts and trading strategies. Also, there's a reference to Cosmoverse, which is an event related to Cosmos, and some political comments like "Harris for Freedom."

Technical aspects like wallets, transactions, and using AI agents for crypto trading are discussed. Terms like "slippage," "market cap," "supply," and specific price points are part of the data. Emojis and slang like "retard," "scam," and "rekt" are present but might not be topics. The user also mentions a YouTube video link related to "Haunted House - Part I" and "OmniFLixTV," which could be a project or NFT.

Putting this all together, the main topics are cryptocurrencies in the Cosmos ecosystem, altcoins, market speculation, trading strategies, scams, AI in crypto, events like Cosmoverse, memes and jokes, technical terms, and possibly NFTs or specific projects like INFERNUM. I should list these without the user IDs, just the subjects they're discussing.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through the messages to get a sense of the overall tone. 

First, I notice that there's a lot of discussion about cryptocurrency projects like Cosmos, Juno, ATOM, Dymension, etc. The users are talking about prices, market caps, pumps, and dumps. There's some slang and emojis typical in crypto communities. 

Looking at specific messages: 

- "ndcast" says "i love crypto , it's like monetized 4chan" ‚Äì that's positive. 
- "Arcmosis" mentions a "lum network pump 35%" which is positive. 
- There's a lot of banter between users like "iconoicono" and "Jaedawson" discussing strategies and mocking each other, which might be neutral or negative depending on context. 
- "Blockchainparty1" and others talk about "Fading Aj calls are costly" and "shits not funny anymore" which sounds negative. 
- "keyleu" mentions "The only thing that has saved me from extreme poverty..." which is negative. 
- Emojis like üòÇ, üî•, and üí∏ are mixed, but often used in a playful or sarcastic way. 
- There are some insults and accusations of scams, like "Lobo scammed everyone" and "you're a scammer," indicating negative sentiment. 
- Market data from CoinhallBot shows both gains and losses, but the user comments on these might lean either way. 

The text has a mix of positive, negative, and neutral statements. However, the negative comments seem more frequent and intense, especially around scams, losses, and frustration with certain coins like Juno. Positive sentiments are present but less common. The neutral parts are the market data and some factual statements. 

I should tally the number of positive vs. negative messages. Let's see:

Positive: 
- "i love crypto"
- "lum network pump 35%"
- "Pregnant man üòÇ" (maybe neutral)
- "Nailed it @Ajcrypto456"
- "All you got to do is get AJ coins"
- "Next stop for eth 3400"

Negative:
- "shits not funny anymore"
- "Lobo scammed everyone"
- "Juno is a plague"
- "you're a scam

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message and see if there's anything that someone is supposed to do, a decision made by the group, or a plan for what's next.

Starting from the top, ndcast says "yes" but that's just an affirmation. Then iconoicono asks if all 7 numbers have to be in the middle line, which seems like a question about a game. Maybe there's a game where they need to pick numbers, but not sure if that's an action item. Moving on, ndcast mentions a Cosmos SDK casino machine, which might be a joke or a reference, but not an action.

Looking at other messages, there's a lot of crypto trading banter: people discussing picks, pumps, dumps, airdrops, and some personal stuff. For example, Jaedawson says "Guys we will check in 7 days" ‚Äì that's a next step. Also, there's a mention of joining a group in someone's bio for updates. Keyleu talks about needing a 2x or 100x to break even, which might be a decision point for their investment.

There's a ban command from keyleu and a bot banning users, so maybe the action items are related to moderation. Also, some users are discussing strategies like buying specific tokens (Kendu Inu, NEXT) and waiting for bull runs. The user millenium_earl2000 asks to choose 7 numbers between 1-49, which could be a next step for a game or poll.

I need to filter out questions and focus on directives or commitments. For instance, "Join the group in my bio" is an action item. "Check in 7 days" is a next step. Banning users, needing a 2x, buying certain tokens, participating in a poll, etc. Also, some users mention attending events like Cosmoverse, which could be a decision to go there.

I should list each action item with the user and the specific task. Maybe also note decisions like "Juno will fly" or "Buy Kendu Inu and NEXT". Also, technical actions like changing a withdraw address or unstaking. Some users are planning to do something based on others' advice, like buying
