**Original Text:**

Failing to Practise Proper Risk Management 

Ignoring risk minimisation strategies is a costly mistake. I’ve learned to always set stop-loss and take-profit levels. For instance, I place stop-loss orders slightly below MACD-verified support points. These practices reduced my losses significantly during bearish phases. Risk management is essential but often neglected. Without clear limits, even strong MACD signals can backfire. I use a 2% risk rule on every trade, maintaining consistency. This strategy has decreased my anxiety in volatile markets and safeguarded my account equity over time. Conclusion 

Mastering the MACD has been a game-changer for me in navigating the complexities of crypto trading. Its ability to simplify market trends and provide actionable signals has not only boosted my confidence but also improved the consistency of my decisions. By combining MACD with other tools and refining strategies through practice, I’ve been able to adapt to different market conditions effectively.
