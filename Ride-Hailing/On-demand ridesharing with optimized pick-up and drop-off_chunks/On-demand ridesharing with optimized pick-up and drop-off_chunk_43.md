**Original Text:**

(12) ensures is that the pick-up node of each request has to be in the same group as its actual origin, and it does not matter
which node within that group, exactly as in GTSP. The drop-off plays no role because it is costless to go by vehicle to w, and the vehicle
is then forced to return to its initial point. Hence, it is straightforward to see that each feasible solution for GTSP is a feasible solution
for our problem and vice versa, with equal costs. This result does not apply when walks are not admitted, because in that case calculating cost(τ, v) is much more similar to
(asymmetric) TSP, which does admit constant-approximation algorithms (Svensson et al., 2018). Hence, if one wants to run this model
with high-capacity vehicles, optimizing both the sequence and the PUDO points might be out of reach.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk is explaining a specific technical detail in the context of ridesharing systems, specifically regarding the rebalancing strategies used to optimize the pickup and drop-off nodes within these systems.

The technical details described are:

* The requirement that each feasible solution for Generalized Transit Systems (GTSP) is also feasible for this problem, which implies that the original problem's constraints should be satisfied.
* The fact that if walks are not admitted in GTSP, calculating cost(τ, v) becomes similar to asymmetric TSP, which has constant-approximation algorithms.

This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by:

* Providing a mathematical framework for understanding the relationship between GTSP and our problem
* Highlighting the importance of rebalancing strategies in ridesharing systems

The specific requirements mentioned are:

* The use of Generalized Transit Systems (GTSP) as a reference model
* The admission of walks to define the problem's constraints

There are no conditions, constraints, or specific requirements mentioned that would limit the applicability of this chunk.
