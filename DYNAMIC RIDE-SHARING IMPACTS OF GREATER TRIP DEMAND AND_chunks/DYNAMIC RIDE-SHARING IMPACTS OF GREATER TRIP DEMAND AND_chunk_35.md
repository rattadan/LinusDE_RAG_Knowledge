## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 35

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

The improvement from a value less than 1 to greater than 1 also
speaks to improving the efficiency of the fleet by lowering empty travel. For an adequate ratio of
trip requests to SAVs, peak-time DRS is expected to be maximum, as allowed by spatiotemporal trip collocation, acceptable delays and vehicle-capacity restrictions. If stop-based
pickup and dropoff is selectively enforced in the off-peak, the overall fleet performance
improves from better seat utilization. This may be the ideal trade-off between expecting travelers
to walk to stops throughout the day, which adds delay and deters demand, and no stop
aggregation, where VMT savings are not optimally (or even sub-optimally) high. The second
subplot in Figure 5 shows the AVO trend with 5x trip-density. Increase in density provides for
three AVO peaks where the transition between AM peak and midday peak is the only valley,
before quickly recovering to a high of 1.75.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section, "The improvement from a value less than 1 to greater than 1", describes the technical details and parameters related to optimizing the efficiency of a shared autonomous vehicle fleet.

**Technical Details/Parameters:**

- The improvement from 1 (a baseline value) to 2 (improving efficiency)
- Efficiency being measured in terms of empty travel and its relation to demand
- Specific parameters mentioned include:
    - Ratio of trip requests to Shared Active Vehicles (SAVs): 5x trip-density
    - Peak time DRS (Minimum Requirements for Service): Maximum
    - Acceptable delays: Spatiotemporal trip collocation, acceptable delays, and vehicle-capacity restrictions

**Context Connection/Building upon Surrounding Context:**

- This section is built upon the context provided about shared autonomous vehicles and their performance in various aspects.
- It builds on the discussion of how different factors affect the efficiency of a fleet, specifically peak time DRS and the optimal ratio of trip requests to SAVs.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

- The required improvement from 1 (baseline) to 2 (improved efficiency) value
- The specific parameters mentioned in this section relate to optimizing the efficiency of a shared autonomous vehicle fleet:
    - Increasing trip-density and peak-time DRS
    - Ensuring acceptable delays while maintaining optimal fleet performance
