## Eureka - Chunk 33

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

IBC transfer from a remote chain to the CW20’s origin chain then perform a swap or any other post-route action on that chain
Chain 2 is the origin chain. The token can be transferred back there, but it can't be used or swapped for anything in the same transaction. Chain 2 is the origin chain. The token can be transferred back there, but it can't be used or swapped for anything in the same transaction. In principle, you can use the Skip Go API to construct any of these action sequences across multiple transactions, but it will be more challenging for you and your end users.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is providing technical details on the potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, specifically focusing on Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol), Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), Hyperlane, and Go Fast.

Here's a breakdown of the specific technical details mentioned:

1. **Timeouts and Slippage**: The text mentions potential issues with timeouts or slippage in IBC, which can cause tokens to be sent back to the source chain. It also notes that similar issues may occur when performing swaps or other post-route actions on the destination chain.

Technical parameters or processes mentioned:

* Timeouts
* Slippage

2. **Post-Swap Failures**: The text explains that similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the destination chain if an issue arises.

Technical parameters or processes mentioned:

* Token swapping and relaying
* Destination chain issues (slippage, timeouts)

3. **Short-term Solutions**:
	* Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
	* Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

Technical parameters or processes mentioned:

* API modifications
* Relayer/client monitoring

4. **Medium-term Solutions**:
	* Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

Technical parameters or processes mentioned:

* Incentives for relayers

5. **Long-term Solutions**:
	* Implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

Technical parameters or processes mentioned:

* Error handling
* Fallback mechanisms

The current text chunk connects to and builds upon the surrounding context by providing an overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols, which is necessary for understanding how these failures can impact users and developers. The technical details and solutions discussed provide a foundation for implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

No specific requirements or conditions are mentioned that need to be met to use the Skip Go API and Client TypeScript Package. However, it is implied that developers need to have basic knowledge of blockchain protocols and APIs to implement these solutions.
