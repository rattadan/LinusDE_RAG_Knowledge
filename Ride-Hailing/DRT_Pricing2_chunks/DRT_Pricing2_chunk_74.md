## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 74

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

In our
experiments, minimizing travel times to pickup locations never leads
to worse results than minimizing the waiting times; often the results in
terms of service rate and waiting time are slightly or moderately better. Maximizing the reward gained leads to the worst service rate since
longer requests are preferred. Even when comparing the total reward
instead of the service rate, this strategy still produces slightly worse
results than the other strategies due to its greedy character. Minimizing
distances or travel times to the drop-off locations prioritizes shorter requests. This strategy results in approximately 2% more served requests
in settings where the other strategies have a service rate of less than
85%. However, the total distance traveled with customers on board
is reduced by 7%. The preference for shorter requests (and therefore
unequal treatment of customers) is also apparent when considering the
correlation between request distance and request rejection, increasing
from 0.06 to 0.41.
