- The username "CosmosEcosystem" and the channel title suggest it's an appropriate forum for Cosmos-related announcements
- The message is straightforward without obvious red flags or suspicious links
- However, I cannot fully verify the authenticity of the sender as "AstroMint core contributor" without additional context or verification

4. Which ecosystem/project the account advertises:
- The message explicitly mentions "Cosmos" and appears in the "Cosmos Ecosystem" channel
