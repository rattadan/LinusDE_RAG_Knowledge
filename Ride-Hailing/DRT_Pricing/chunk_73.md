## Chunk 73

**Original Text:**

Similar to the finding in [see, e.g., 9], this highlights the
importance to combine ’pull’ measures (introducing DRT as a new mode of transportation) with ’push’ measures,
such as, implementing a road pricing scheme, increasing parking costs or banning private vehicles in certain areas. In
several simulation experiments, even for a city-wide DRT and a minimum fee, a significant share of DRT users come
from the PT mode. From the user perspective, this indicates a positive effect since users switching from PT to DRT
experience a reduced travel time and obtain a higher utility. Future studies will address service concepts which aim at a desired mode shift effect. The simulation setup will
also be extended to account for intermodal trips, in particular the combination of PT and DRT which is expected to
have a positive effect on the modal shift from car to PT and/or DRT.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This passage mentions that there are two types of measures used together: "pull" measures (introducing Dedicated Rapid Transit as a new mode of transportation) and "push" measures (implementing a road pricing scheme, increasing parking costs, or banning private vehicles in certain areas). It highlights the importance of combining these measures to achieve a significant positive impact on the number of users switching from one mode of transportation (Public Transportation, PT) to another.
