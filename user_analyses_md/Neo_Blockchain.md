Contextualizing these tweets within the broader intentions of the author:
These messages represent standard promotional activities for a blockchain project participating in a major industry conference. By highlighting their booth location and inviting attendees to "meet the team" and "be the first to see what we're building," the author aims to generate interest, foster community connections, and position Neo as an active, innovative player in the Web3 space. The reference to NFI waypoints suggests they're implementing gamification or interactive elements to engage attendees, which is a common strategy at blockchain conferences to drive booth traffic and user engagement.
