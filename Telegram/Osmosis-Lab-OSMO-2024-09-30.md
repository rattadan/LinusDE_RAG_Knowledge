## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through the provided chat messages and identify the key points and decisions. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the main issues discussed and any resolutions or actions taken.

Looking at the earliest messages, there's a user asking about a block explorer for nBTC/Nomic. Moonz_9 mentions missing Chainscope, and Mikebarb suggests BigDipper as an alternative. That's one topic‚Äîblock explorer recommendations.

Then there's a conversation about EURe being listed on Osmosis but needing more liquidity. Davidjgoosey provides a link and mentions Noble is finalizing some parts. So the key point here is EURe's availability and the need for liquidity.

Another user, Me372..., is having issues withdrawing ETH from Osmosis. They mention an error about not having enough to cover fees. Kychuli and BasementNodes discuss using bridges like Squid or Satellite, noting high fees (up to $50) and suggesting waiting for cheaper gas. They also mention swapping alloyed ETH to .axl version. The user decides to proceed with a full send despite the fees. So the main points here are withdrawal issues, high bridge fees, and the suggestion to wait or use specific bridges.

There's a mention of a known issue with unbonding liquidity, where Kychuli says it's fixed in a preview deployment and will be on the main page soon. Tzouzepe13 asks how long to wait, and Kychuli estimates not long, maybe a week. Also, a user is warned about scammers and advised to block DMs.

Additionally, someone is asking about a faucet error on Osmosis testnet, and Khuwarzmi and others are offering help via DMs. The support site is mentioned multiple times by the bot.

So, the summary should group these topics: block explorer recommendations, EURe listing and liquidity, ETH withdrawal issues with bridge fees and solutions, unbonding errors and upcoming fixes, scam warnings, and faucet errors. Each section should be brief, highlighting the problem and any advice or decisions made.

I need to make sure not to include every message but only the key points. For example, the repeated "Thank you" and "Send me address" can be condensed. Also, note the timestamps to see the flow, but since the summary is concise, maybe not necessary. Check

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to understand what the text is about. Looking through the messages, they seem to be from a Discord or similar platform, discussing issues related to the Osmosis blockchain.

The main topics I notice are:

1. **Support Requests**: Multiple users are asking for help, like "Hello i need support" and "May I DM you for help?" Also, the statbot links to the support site. So support is a recurring theme.

2. **Transaction Fees and Errors**: There's a lot about fees, especially when withdrawing ETH. The user mentions "not enough to cover fee" and discusses gas costs on Ethereum. Squid and Satellite bridges are mentioned in this context.

3. **Bridging and Swapping ETH**: The conversation includes using bridges like SquidRouter and Satellite to move ETH between networks, swapping .axl ETH to other versions. This seems technical but important.

4. **Unbonding Issues**: One user reports an error when unbonding liquidity pairs, and others mention it's a known issue being fixed.

5. **EURe Token Listing**: Davidjgoosey talks about EURe being listed but lacking liquidity, and Noble's final steps for it.

6. **Testnet Faucet Problems**: NFTM0nk mentions an "out of gas" error on the testnet faucet.

7. **Scams and Security**: Kychuli advises blocking DMs from scammers, so security is a topic.

8. **Website Usability**: Le_Millenariste_incorruptible criticizes a site's reliability and name, indicating user interface concerns.

9. **Asset Recovery Queries**: Mahyarblue's friend can't find Coreum tokens bought months ago, suggesting asset recovery issues.

10. **Block Explorers**: Chessmany3k asks for a block explorer for nbtc nomic, and others suggest alternatives like BigDipper.

I need to ensure these topics are distinct and cover all the main points. Let me check again. The support site is mentioned multiple times, but that's part of the support requests. The EURe listing is separate from the other issues. The unbonding and faucet errors are specific technical problems. Scams and security are a separate concern. Asset recovery and block explorers are also

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from a platform related to Osmosis, which seems to be a blockchain or DeFi project. The task is to determine the overall sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The bot messages from osmosis_statbot are just directing users to the support site. They don't have any sentiment themselves. Then there's kychuli, who's helping users with issues. He mentions things like high fees, errors when withdrawing ETH, and suggests using specific tools like SquidRouter. The user Me3728... is frustrated because they can't withdraw due to fees and not having enough ETH. They use emojis like üòÇ and "Bro," which might indicate they're trying to be light-hearted but are still facing problems.

Looking at other messages, BasementNodes and others talk about transaction costs being expensive. There's a mention of scammers and advising to block DMs, which adds a negative note. Then there's a user asking about a fix for an unbonding issue, and kychuli says it's corrected on a preview deployment but not yet on the main page. That's a problem that's being worked on but not resolved, so maybe neutral or slightly negative.

Some messages are about EURe being listed but lacking liquidity, which could be neutral since it's a fact but users might be disappointed. There's a request for help with a faucet error, and a user who can't find purchased tokens, which are negative experiences. The "I miss chainscope" and questions about block explorers also indicate dissatisfaction.

Putting this all together, the majority of the messages are about technical issues, high fees, errors, and users seeking support. While some responses are helpful (positive), the overall context is users facing problems and expressing frustration. However, there's also a lot of neutral information exchanged, like links and status updates. The negative sentiments come from users encountering errors, high costs, and scammers. The positive parts are the support team trying to assist, but the main sentiment seems more negative due to the recurring issues. Wait, but maybe it's neutral because it's a mix of problems and support responses. Hmm. Need to check if the negative aspects outweigh the positive. The user's own messages show frustration with fees and errors, and others mention similar issues. The support team is active

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I need to go through each message carefully and identify any explicit or implicit actions that need to be taken, decisions made, or next steps mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first message is from osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's a standard help prompt, so maybe not an action item but a resource. Then Me3728... mentions receiving DMs, which could indicate a need to be cautious about scams. Kychuli's message about blocking DMs from scammers is a clear action item.

Looking at the conversation about withdrawing ETH, there's a lot of back and forth. Me3728 is having trouble with fees and needs help. Kychuli suggests using SquidRouter to swap to .axl ETH, which is a specific next step. Also, the mention of opening a support ticket is another action item.

There's a part where kychuli says to check the gas fees on SquidRouter and wait for cheaper times. That's a decision point for the user to either proceed now or wait. The user also mentions they have to "full send" because there's no space to test, which might not be an action item but a statement of their situation.

Another section talks about an unbonding issue. Tzouzepe13 asks what to do, and kychuli provides a preview deployment link. The user is advised to wait for the main page fix, which is a next step. Also, the suggestion to visit the support site again comes up, so that's a recurring resource.

Then there's a discussion about EURe listing on Osmosis. Davidjgoosey mentions it's already listed but lacks liquidity. The next step here might be to monitor or add liquidity, but it's not very explicit. The user ips14 asks when EUR will be on Osmosis, and the response is "very soon," which is more of a timeframe than an action.

Khuwarzmi offers to send tokens to an Osmo address, which is an action item if someone responds. The testnet faucet error reported by NFTM0nk requires someone to resolve, so that's another action item. Mahyarblue's friend's issue with Coreum on Osmosis might need a support ticket, which
