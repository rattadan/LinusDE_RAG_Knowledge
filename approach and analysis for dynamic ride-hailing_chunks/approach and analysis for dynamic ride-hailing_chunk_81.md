**Original Text:**

Only in settings with a highly utilized fleet
(𝐷𝑆𝑅 ∈ {70, 100}) and long allowed waiting times (𝑇𝑊 = 1029),
our strategy performs slightly worse than the global matching-based
strategy. However, in these settings, all tested strategies perform more
or less equally. The match missed requests strategy does not provide a
significant improvement compared to the nearest parking lot strategy in
our study. The iterative zone balance strategy performs slightly better for
low-utilized fleets as well as in settings without waiting time restrictions. In the remaining settings, there is no improvement observable. Both versions of the global matching strategy can improve the results
of the nearest strategy, often significantly. Additionally, the restricted
version achieves comparable results to the unrestricted version. The
main benefit of our strategy seems to be the lot-centric view, which
allows the positioning of vehicles very close to areas of high demand.

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

The specific technical details mentioned in this chunk are:

* `𝐷𝑆𝑅 ∈ {70, 100}`: The utilization level of the fleet, where 70 is a highly utilized fleet (DSR=70) and 100 is a very highly utilized fleet (DSR=100).
* `𝑇𝑊 = 1029`: The allowed waiting time for passengers.
* `𝐷𝑃𝐺 (𝒩 𝒲𝓞𝓊𝒶𝓈𝒹𝒴𝒁𝒖𝒸)`: A spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network, which is a deep learning approach used for demand forecasting.
* `𝑅𝐴𝐾 (𝒩 𝒲𝓞𝓊𝒶𝓈𝒹𝒴𝒁𝒖𝒸)`: A real-world ride-hailing vehicle repositioning using deep RL, which is another deep learning approach used for demand forecasting.

**Connection to the surrounding context:**

The current text chunk connects to the surrounding context by referencing specific methodologies and datasets mentioned in the document. It also highlights the main benefits of a new strategy being compared to existing strategies. The text assumes that the reader is familiar with ride-hailing systems, simulation platforms (such as DIMACS), and deep learning approaches.

**Specific requirements and conditions:**

There are no explicit requirements or conditions mentioned in this chunk. However, it appears that the strategy being described requires:

* High utilization levels of the fleet to be effective
* Long allowed waiting times for passengers to impact performance
* A lot-centric view for positioning vehicles near areas of high demand

Overall, the current text chunk provides a detailed technical analysis of a new approach in ride-hailing systems and its effectiveness in specific scenarios.
