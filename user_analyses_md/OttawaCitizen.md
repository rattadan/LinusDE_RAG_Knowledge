Also, there's something about OC Transpo's free-fare weekend. So the main themes are local news, public safety, healthcare, and transportation.

Next, the language style. The tweets are straightforward, factual, and concise. They use hashtags like #HealthcareCanada and #DrugPrices, which are common in news updates. The tone is neutral, just reporting events without personal opinions. No emotional language, just the facts.
