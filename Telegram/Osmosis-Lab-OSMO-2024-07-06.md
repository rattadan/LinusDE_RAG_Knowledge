## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I'll go through each message to identify the main topics.

Starting from the top, there's a support message from osmosis_statbot. Then BasementNodes and profesija are talking about order books and concentrated liquidity (CL) pools. E27010 is asking about apps developed by the Osmo team. Svansy and BasementNodes discuss browser console logs, geoblocking in Germany, and issues with the DEX. They mention that hard refreshing fixes some problems. There's a mention of a proposal to grant Omnity Network contract deployment rights on Osmosis. Also, discussions about staking Osmosis and borrowing assets, with a suggestion to use Stride. Other topics include liquidity issues, user experience complaints, and some off-topic messages like the IBC channel viewer and a joke about Bitcoin.

Key points to highlight: the support link, the proposal for Omnity Network, geoblocking and frontend tracking, DEX usability issues, suggestions to use console logs and hard refresh, staking and lending via Stride, and liquidity concerns. Decisions might include the team considering incentivizing error reports with tx hashes and using existing CL pools for implementation. I need to make sure to exclude off-topic stuff like the Jeopardy joke and the morning greeting. Keep it structured and concise, focusing on the main issues and proposals discussed.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify recurring or significant themes.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a support link. That's about support resources. Then BasementNodes mentions CL pools (concentrated liquidity) and implementing features. Profesija asks "wen orderbooks?" which is a common way to ask when order books will be available. So that's order books as a topic. 

Looking at other messages, there's a discussion about geoblocking and issues in specific regions like Germany, France, Greece, Italy, and Hong Kong. Users are experiencing bugs and errors, so that's another topic. Console logs and error reports are mentioned, which relates to troubleshooting. 

Sumit_199 has an issue withdrawing Canto from Osmosis, so cross-chain withdrawals and maybe Canto integration come up. GPKwee suggests using IBC fun or TFM, which are cross-chain bridges. Then there's a conversation about liquid staking and borrowing/lending on Stride and Mars, indicating interest in staking and lending protocols. 

Another user mentions the SQS (maybe a specific feature or tool within Osmosis). The Osmogovbot message talks about a proposal to grant Omnity Network contract deployment rights, so governance proposals and CosmWasm contracts are topics. 

There's also a mention of a Bitcoin-related project (Port contract, ckBTC) and some frustration about the DEX being broken, pointing to user experience issues. The user also refers to stablecoin and ATOM/OSMO liquidity, so liquidity pools and token availability are important. 

Additionally, there's a link to an IBC channel viewer, which is another tool. Some messages are about community interactions, like Max Power fans and greetings, but those might be less relevant. 

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be: support resources, concentrated liquidity (CL) pools, order books, geoblocking, user-reported bugs, console logs for troubleshooting, cross-chain withdrawals (Canto), cross-chain bridges (IBC fun, TFM), liquid staking, borrowing/lending protocols (Stride, Mars), SQS feature, governance proposals, CosmWasm contracts, Bitcoin assets (ckBTC), liquidity pools for stablecoins and AT

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different users on a platform related to Osmosis, which seems to be a decentralized exchange (DEX) in the crypto space. The task is to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll go through each message one by one. The first message is from a bot directing users to the support site. That's neutral because it's just providing information. Then there's BasementNodes talking about implementing something with CL pools. They're hopeful, so that's a bit positive, but the "idk" makes me think maybe neutral. 

Next, profesija asks "wen orderbooks?" which is a common way in crypto communities to ask when a feature will be implemented. The tone here is probably neutral to slightly negative because it's a question about something missing. Then BasementNodes says "Hence the warnings" and "Third parties" which might indicate some issues, leaning towards negative. 

E27010 is asking about apps developed by the Osmo team. The question itself is neutral, but the context of the conversation might influence it. Svansy's messages have a lot of frustration: "this dex so broken omg", "i need swappities pls", "hard refresh multiple times fixed it". These are clearly negative. 

BasementNodes mentions geoblocking in certain areas, which could be negative for users in those regions. However, they also say they don't have issues because they block tracking, which is positive for them but maybe neutral overall. There's a discussion about errors, console logs, and transaction hashes, which seems technical but indicates problems being addressed, so maybe neutral. 

The user_7164487109 asks about staking and borrowing, which is neutral. The proposal from osmogovbot is about deploying contracts, which is a positive development. Other messages include greetings and some off-topic comments like "fellow Max Power fanboys" which are neutral. 

Looking at the overall pattern: there are multiple complaints about the DEX being broken, needing refreshes, and issues with specific areas (Germany, France, HK). These are negative. However, there are also some neutral messages like support links, technical discussions, and a proposal which might indicate ongoing development (positive). 

The most negative parts come from Svansy's repeated frustrations. Basement

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people, mostly about Osmosis, which seems to be a decentralized exchange (DEX) in the crypto space. 

First, I need to go through each message and look for any explicit mentions of tasks, plans, or decisions. Let me start from the top.

The first line is from osmosis_statbot repeating a support site link. That's probably not an action item but just a standard message. 

Then there's BasementNodes and profesija. Profesija asks "wen orderbooks?" which is a question about when orderbooks will be implemented. Wen is slang for "when" in crypto communities. So maybe that's a request or a next step someone needs to address. But since it's a question, not an action item assigned, maybe not. 

E27010 asks if two apps are developed by the Osmo team. That's a question needing clarification, but unless someone answers and assigns a task, maybe not an action item. 

Svansy and BasementNodes are discussing issues with the DEX, like errors, refreshing, geoblocking. Svansy mentions hard refresh fixed it, which is a solution they found. BasementNodes suggests grabbing console logs next time, which could be an action item for Svansy to do that. Also, BasementNodes mentions incentivizing unique error reports with tx hashes. That sounds like a possible action item for the team to implement.

Then there's a user asking about withdrawing canto from Osmosis. GPKwee suggests using IBC fun or TFM. That's a recommendation but not sure if it's an action item for the team. 

Another user asks about staking Osmosis and borrowing assets. GPKwee says to use Stride, which is a link to a site. Again, a suggestion but maybe not an action item unless the team needs to integrate Stride.

There's a proposal from osmogovbot about granting Omnity Network the ability to deploy contracts. That's a decision that's been made or is being proposed. The summary mentions the deployer address and the Port contract, so maybe the action item here is the deployment of the contract, which is part of the proposal.

Svansy and BasementNodes also talk about liquidity issues, like
