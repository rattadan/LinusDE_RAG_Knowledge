I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

Regarding waiting time
minimization in settings without a waiting time constraint, however,
the restricted global matching provides a far better cost/improvement
ratio while already significantly reducing the waiting time compared
to the nearest repositioning. The additional waiting time reduction by
our strategy is then quite expensive. Please note that in our strategy
for these settings, lower repositioning costs can be traded for longer
waiting times by increasing the (artificially set) radius of the lot zones. Note as well that the reported kilometers per additional request in the
top part of Table 4 do not really arise for every additional request
but are rather distributed over all served requests. If service rate and
costs are combined into one single reward function (see, e.g., Kullman
et al., 2021), a strategy provides a benefit over the nearest repositioning
whenever the average profit per request is higher than the costs for
traveling the reported distances. When is repositioning most important?

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details and parameters of a dynamic dispatch and rebalancing strategy in ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on minimizing waiting time without a waiting time constraint.

The context provided includes various references to related topics such as simulation, modeling, demand forecasting, and deep learning approaches. However, this specific chunk primarily focuses on:

1. Technical details: The section mentions the use of a "restricted global matching" approach for dynamic dispatch, which is a methodological approach used in simulations.
2. Parameters and processes:
   - "Lower repositioning costs can be traded for longer waiting times by increasing the (artificially set) radius of the lot zones."
   - "The reported kilometers per additional request in the top part of Table 4 do not really arise for every additional request but are rather distributed over all served requests. If service rate and costs are combined into one single reward function..."
3. Contextual connection:
   - The section builds upon the surrounding context by discussing various aspects of dynamic dispatch and rebalancing strategies, including simulation, demand forecasting, and deep learning approaches.
   - It highlights that while minimizing waiting time is crucial in ride-hailing systems without a waiting time constraint, the trade-off between repositioning costs and waiting times may be more significant when combined with other factors.

The specific requirements or conditions mentioned include:

- The need to minimize waiting time
- Without a waiting time constraint
- Dynamic dispatch and rebalancing strategies
