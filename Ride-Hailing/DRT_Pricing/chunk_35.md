## Chunk 35

**Original Text:**

To improve computational performance, in this study, a 10% sample is used and the DRT fleet size and road
capacities are accordingly reduced. A detailed description of the applied case study is provided in Ziemke et al. [13]. The Berlin case study which is used in this study is publicly available on https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsimberlin (development branch 5.5.x, commit 7c5c791). Simulation setup.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the information provided, it appears that a case study has been applied to improve computational performance using a scenario described in Ziemke et al.'s study [13]. Here's a detailed description of the applied case study:

* A 10% sample size is used for simulations.
* The fleet size and road capacities are adjusted accordingly, indicating an effort to optimize resource allocation.

The Berlin case study (available on GitHub: https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsimberlin) has been modified from the original version. However, without more context or information about how this specific modification was made, it's challenging to provide a detailed description of the simulation setup used in this particular case study.

That being said, here are some possible factors that might be considered when setting up a similar simulation:

1. **Fleet size reduction**: Reducing the fleet size by 10% could lead to significant computational savings, as it would require less data processing and modeling.
2. **Road capacity adjustments**: Modifying road capacities (e.g., reducing the number of lanes or altering traffic signal timing) might also result in substantial computational reductions.
3. **Data aggregation**: Selectively aggregating data from various sources (e.g., traffic counts, road conditions) could help reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed and analyzed.

To further improve computational performance, it's essential to:

1. **Optimize data structures**: Use efficient data structures and algorithms to store and manipulate large datasets.
2. **Implement parallel processing**: Leverage multiple CPU cores or GPUs to speed up computations and model simulations.
3. **Choose suitable simulation models**: Select models that are optimized for computational efficiency and can handle complex scenarios with minimal overhead.

By addressing these factors, researchers and practitioners can create efficient and effective simulation scenarios that deliver valuable insights without excessive computational resources.
