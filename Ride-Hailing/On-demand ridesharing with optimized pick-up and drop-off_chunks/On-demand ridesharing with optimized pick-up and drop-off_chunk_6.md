**Original Text:**

However, optimizing the PUDO points together with the
assignment between users and vehicles can be quite challenging from an algorithmic point of view. Even when passengers do not walk,
the efficient operation of a ridesharing system is a complex mathematical task. The main reason is that it extends two classical NP-Hard
problems: Dynamic VRP, because it is on-demand, and Dial-A-Ride, due to its sharing aspect. From an intuitive point of view, the
complexity emerges due to a large number of feasible combinations between travelers and vehicles. Recently, some papers have
proposed techniques that permit operating such systems at the scale of thousands of users per hour (Alonso-Mora et al., 2017;
Simonetto et al., 2019; Tsao et al., 2019).
