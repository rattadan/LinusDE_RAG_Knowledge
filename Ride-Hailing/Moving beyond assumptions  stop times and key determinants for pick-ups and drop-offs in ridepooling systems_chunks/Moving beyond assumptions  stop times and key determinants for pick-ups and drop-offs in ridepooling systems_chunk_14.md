process is treated as a deterministic parameter. Further explanation or empirical evidence
is missing. In addition to the research that considers a fixed value for the stop time in all scenarios, there are simulation studies that explore the impact of varying stop times on service
performance. For instance, Lotze et al. (2023a) propose a dimensionless indicator to assess
the sustainability of ridepooling services and considered five stop time scenarios ranging
from 0 s to 80 s in 20-second increments.
