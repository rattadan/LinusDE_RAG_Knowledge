## Chunk 46

**Original Text:**

Simulation experiments. In different simulation experiments, the DRT mode is added as an additional mode of transportation as described in Sec. 3 and the DRT service area is either set to (1) the inner-city Berlin area or (2) the entire
Berlin area. The DRT fare is set to a distance-based fare of 0.35 EUR/km, and the minimum fee is set to (a) 0.00,
(b) 2.00 or (c) 3.00 EUR. All simulation experiments are carried out for two pricing schemes for the car mode: i) no
tolling and ii) with a toll of 0.20 EUR/km.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

To simulate the DRT mode as an additional transportation option in different simulation experiments, we can use the provided information to create hypothetical scenarios. Given that I don't have access to real-time data or specific models, I'll guide you through a general approach on how to structure your simulations.

### Step 1: Define Simulation Parameters

Before running any simulation, it's essential to define all parameters, including:

- **Scenario:** The mode of transportation (car, DRT, etc.).
- **Simulation Area:** The specific area or service area for the DRT service.
- **Fare Structure:** The base fare and fee structure for both car and DRT modes.
- **Toll Structure:** Whether tolling is enabled for car mode or not.
- **Price Schemes:** For each pricing scheme (no tolling vs. with a 0.20 EUR/km toll).

### Step 2: Set Up the Simulation Framework

You can use programming languages like Python, R, or even specialized transportation simulation software to set up and run your simulations.

For example, in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define parameters
car_base_fare = 0.35  # EUR/km
car_fee = 0  # EUR/km
drt_service_area = "inner city Berlin"
drt_toll_rate = 0.20  # EUR/km
no_toll_car_mode_prices = [0] * 2  # Prices for car mode without tolling
with_toll_drt_prices = [drt_base_fare + dt * drt_fee for dt, drt_fee in [(1, 0), (10, 3)]]  # Prices with and without DRT toll

# Generate random prices within a certain range for testing purposes
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
no_toll_car_mode_prices = np.random.uniform(low=0.00, high=100, size=len(car_base_fare))
with_toll_drt_prices = np.random.uniform(low=drt_base_fare + (drt_fee * 10), high=drt_base_fare + (drt_fee * 20), size=len(drt_base_fare))

# Print prices for testing
print("Prices for car mode without tolling:")
for i, price in enumerate(no_toll_car_mode_prices):
    print(f"Mode {i+1}: {price:.2f} EUR/km")

print("\nPrices for car mode with DRT tolling:")
for i, price in enumerate(with_toll_drt_prices):
    print(f"Mode {i+1}: {price:.2f} EUR/km")
```

### Step 3: Run the Simulation

For each scenario (e.g., inner city Berlin vs. entire Berlin area), run your simulation using your chosen parameters and output the results for both car mode with and without tolling.

This step would typically involve iterating over different combinations of parameters and running simulations for multiple pricing schemes. You may also need to add additional logic or conditions based on real-world scenarios, user preferences, etc.

### Step 4: Analyze Results

After running all simulated experiments, analyze the results to understand how the addition of DRT mode affects traffic flow, costs, revenue, and user behavior in each scenario compared to no tolling. This could involve visualizations (e.g., plots) or detailed financial analysis.

Remember, this is a general guide. Depending on your specific needs, you might need to adjust parameters, add more complexity, or use different simulation tools.
