## Source Context
*From: https://www.noble.xyz/*

### Document Overview  
The content outlines Noble's announcements of EURe (a Euro-backed stablecoin in the IBC ecosystem) and CCTP (a USDC access solution for the Cosmos ecosystem), along with details about native USDC and its deployment on Celestia rollups.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Euro-backed stablecoins**: EURe is the first Euro-backed stablecoin in the IBC ecosystem.  
- **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)**: A protocol enabling cross-chain communication and asset transfer.  
- **Cosmos ecosystem**: A decentralized network of blockchains with interoperability features.  
- **USDC (USD Coin)**: A stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, bridged to multiple blockchains.  
- **Native USDC**: USDC issued directly on a blockchain (e.g., Noble) without intermediaries.  
- **Celestia rollups**: A Layer 2 solution for the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling efficient transaction processing.  
- **Bridged forms of USDC**: USDC issued on different blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Cosmos) with varying features.  

### Implementation Details  
- **EURe**: A Euro-backed stablecoin with a 1:1 peg to EUR, built on IBC-enabled blockchains.  
- **CCTP (Cosmos Token Protocol)**: A bridge enabling seamless access to USDC on the Cosmos ecosystem, enhancing liquidity and UX.  
- **Native USDC on Celestia**: Noble plans to deploy native USDC on Celestia rollups, allowing users to interact with Cosmos-based assets directly.  
- **FRNZ tokens**: Distributed as a community reward for participation, highlighting Noble's commitment to community engagement.  

### Related Topics  
- **Cosmos ecosystem interoperability**: EURe and CCTP align with the Cosmos ecosystem’s goals of cross-chain asset transfer.  
- **Native USDC vs. bridged USDC**: The content contrasts native USDC (directly on Noble) with bridged forms (e.g., USDC on Ethereum).  
- **Celestia rollups**: The deployment of native USDC on Celestia rollups underscores Noble’s strategy to expand its ecosystem through Layer 2 solutions.
