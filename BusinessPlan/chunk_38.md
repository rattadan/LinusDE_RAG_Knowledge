As part of our partnership, businesses sending job requests to drivers through the OneApp platform will
need to pay in $NRIDE. This creates a seamless and frictionless transaction process, as the $NRIDE
token serves as the base currency for transaction fees on the OneApp platform. This integration benefits
both parties by placing demand on the $NRIDE token for its utility factor, while simultaneously allowing
OneApp to accrue value through a geographically agnostic form of payment.
