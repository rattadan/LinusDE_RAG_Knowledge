### Document Overview  
The content discusses the evolution of blockchain technologies, key events in cryptocurrency markets (e.g., Bitcoin halving, NFTs, DeFi), and the impact of regulatory changes on digital assets.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Blockchain Halving**: Bitcoin's supply reduction every four years, leading to price increases.  
- **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**: Decentralized digital assets on Ethereum, popularized by projects like CryptoKitties and Bored Ape Yacht Club.  
- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Smart contract-based financial services (e.g., lending, trading) on blockchain networks.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated agreements on blockchain that execute rules without intermediaries.  
- **Market Dynamics**: Price fluctuations driven by supply constraints (e.g., Bitcoin's 21 million circulating supply) and regulatory shifts (e.g., crypto bans).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Halving Events**: Bitcoin's supply halves every 210,000 blocks (e.g., 2016 halving led to $20,000+ price in 2017).  
- **NFTs**: Ethereum’s ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards enabled tokenization of unique digital assets.  
- **DeFi Protocols**: Platforms like Aave, Uniswap, and Compound use smart contracts for lending, trading, and staking.  
- **Market Volatility**: Price movements tied to supply constraints (e.g., 21 million BTC limit) and regulatory actions (e.g., China’s 2021 ban).  

### Related Topics  
- **Blockchain Architecture**: Connections to Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities and DeFi ecosystems.  
- **Market Trends**: Correlations between halving events, NFT adoption, and regulatory changes.  
- **Regulatory Impact**: How policy shifts (e.g., legal tender recognition, bans) influence crypto markets.

continued to rise in significance in the cryptocurrency community. Popular cryptocurrency collectibles callednon-fungible tokens(NFTs) emerged on Ethereum with early collections, such as CryptoKitties, MoonCats, and CryptoPunks. New fields such asdecentralized finance(DeFi) began using smart contract technology to provide users with decentralized services such as trading, lending, and borrowing. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum influenced developers to create similar smart contract-based blockchains. Ethereumâs competitor chains includeCardano,Solana, andPolkadot.Â

On July 9, 2016, Bitcoin's daily issuance dropped from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC per block in a preprogrammed halving event. Every four years, Bitcoin's supply reduces by half until there are 21 million BTC in circulation. Although 2012 was the first halving event in BTC's history, 2016's halving led to a significant rise in BTC's price in 2017, culminating in BTC almost breaking the $20,000 level in December. Although the entire crypto market fell after the 2017 bull run, more investors became aware of digital assets.Â

The cryptocurrency marketâs coverage increased after Bitcoin's next halving event on May 11, 2020. Like the post-2016 halving era, BTC entered a new bull run in 2021 and nearly touched $70,000 per coin in November. Companies, such as Tesla and MicroStrategy, started putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and countries like El Salvador recognized it as legal tender. NFTs also became famous as celebrities, influencers, and companies brought attention to collections like CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club.Â

Despite Bitcoinâs massive growth, China announced a crypto ban in 2021, leading to a decline in BTCâs price. Although Bitcoin quickly regained its value, 2022 was challenging for crypto projects and companies. First, Terraform Labs' multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency LUNA fell to zero after its experimental stablecoin UST failed when UST lost its pegged value.
