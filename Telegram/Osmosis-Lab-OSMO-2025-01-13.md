## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I need to go through the text and pick out the important parts.

Starting from the top, WhoIsAbk mentions a 10/10 service, figured out a transaction, got into a raffle, and received a Taco Bell gift card. That's positive feedback and a mention of a support process that worked well.

Then there's osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. Repeated by Khuwarzmi later, so maybe that's a standard response.

Looking at the news from osmosis_news, there's a Twitter link and a governance proposal about IBC Rate Limiting v2.1. Important for updates or decisions related to security.

The main issue seems to be user_7319137956 struggling with adding liquidity to pools 2628 and 2629 for CKBTC/USDC. They spent $40 creating two pools but can't add liquidity, making them invisible on the UI. BasementNodes and Khuwarzmi are helping. BasementNodes provided a template transaction message and suggested using daodao.zone to create a custom action. Khuwarzmi checked the pools and thought it might be due to zero liquidity. They also mentioned Celatone for viewing pool details. Yusungsang reacts to a $100M figure, maybe related to liquidity or the pools.

Technical details include using the MsgCreatePosition message, setting lower and upper ticks, tokens provided, and fees. Also, a mention of a UX issue by BasementNodes, calling the UI brutal. There's a troubleshooting part with pressing Ctrl+Shift+R for a hard reload, console issues, and token visibility problems.

Key decisions or actions: user_7319137956 needs to add liquidity to make pools visible, BasementNodes provided a transaction template, Khuwarzmi suggested checking pool liquidity, and there's a governance proposal on IBC rate limiting. Also, the support links are repeated, indicating official channels.

I should structure the summary around the user's problem and the solutions provided, mention the governance update, and note the UX criticism. Keep it concise, avoid minor comments like the Taco Bell gift card unless it's a key point. Focus on the liquidity pool issues, the technical steps suggested, and the governance proposal.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key points are.

Starting with the first message from WhoIsAbk, they mention a 10/10 service, a transaction, a raffle, and a Taco Bell gift card. So topics here might be "Customer service experience," "Transaction assistance," "Promotional raffle," and "Gift card reward."

Next, osmosis_statbot links to the support site. That's straightforward: "Official support site." Then osmosis_news shares a Twitter link, so "Social media updates" or "Twitter announcements." 

WhoIsAbk again talks about a large gap, and user_7319137956 mentions a "trikky range gap." Maybe "Liquidity gap issues" or "Range gap challenges." BasementNodes comments on the UI looking weird until more liquidity is added, so "UI/UX feedback" or "User interface problems."

Looking at kychuli's message with the JSON code, it's about creating a liquidity position. The user also provides a template link, so "Liquidity provision," "Transaction template," and "Pool configuration." They mention setting a range, so maybe "Liquidity range settings."

User_7319137956 jokes about 2050 USD, which could be "Inflation speculation" or "Future currency value." Then they ask about removing liquidity carefully, indicating "Liquidity removal concerns." 

BasementNodes talks about fixing the pool with a small amount, so "Liquidity adjustments" and "Token management." Yusungsang's message is "$100M," which might be "Funding milestone" or "Large transaction." 

Other messages from BasementNodes and Khuwarzmi discuss using daodao.zone for actions, CLI vs. other methods, and pool visibility issues. So "Blockchain transaction tools," "CLI usage," "Pool visibility problems," and "Technical troubleshooting."

There's also a mention of IBC Rate Limiting upgrade proposal from osmogovbot, so "IBC rate limiting upgrade" and "Governance proposals." 

The user_7319137956 is having trouble with the Osmosis UI, so

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by going through each message to understand the overall tone.

First, the user WhoIsAbk says "10/10 service. I figured out my transaction, got entered into a raffle, and received a $10 taco bell gift card. Would use this help line again." That's clearly positive. They're happy with the service and had a good experience.

Then there's osmosis_statbot and osmosis_news, which are neutral. They just provide links or information without any emotional language.

Another message from WhoIsAbk: "Such a large gap." Hmm, this is short. Without context, it's hard to tell, but looking at the other messages around it, maybe they're referring to a liquidity gap? But the sentiment here could be negative if they're complaining, but it's just a statement. Maybe neutral.

user_7319137956 writes "mmmm thats a trikky range gap guys üôÉ" with a wink emoji. The typo "trikky" and the emoji suggest they're being light-hearted or maybe slightly frustrated but not overly negative. Maybe neutral or slightly positive?

BasementNodes says, "yeah I think the chart / graph on the UI looks pretty weird until at least a couple thousand $ in lqiuidity is added." The word "weird" is a bit negative, but they're giving constructive feedback. So maybe slightly negative.

kychuli's message is a JSON template with instructions. It's technical and neutral. The last part mentions a template for next time, which is helpful, so maybe positive.

user_7319137956 again: "In 2050 it will be 2000 USD üòÇ" ‚Äì the laughing emoji indicates a joke, so positive.

kychuli's messages: "just make sure you set a range since the price i set is not proper i just threw tokens in" ‚Äì self-deprecating humor, so neutral or slightly positive. Then "i will leave my peanuts in there for good its less than a penny to get it proper" ‚Äì "peanuts" and "less than a penny" suggest a casual, maybe positive tone.

user_7319137956: "What a fantastic community! Thank you all for you're help

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this chat. The user mentioned that the pools 2628 and 2629 exist on-chain but they can't add liquidity through the Osmosis UI. They also spent $40 upfront and want to use the pools.

Looking at the messages, Khuwarzmi says the pools might not be visible because of zero liquidity. Then, BasementNodes and others discuss using daodao.zone to create a custom action with the MsgCreatePosition message. There's a template provided by kychuli with specific pool details, and BasementNodes suggests using a small amount of tokens to create the position. 

Also, Khuwarzmi asks BasementNodes to add liquidity to pool 2628 to make it visible. There's a mention of a support site link from the statbot. The user_7319137956 is concerned about removing liquidity carefully and the community helps them.

So the action items would be: the user needs to add liquidity via daodao using the template, Osmosis team should check pool visibility when liquidity is zero, and maybe the support site should be promoted. Also, BasementNodes fixed pool 2628 by adding liquidity. Decisions include using the provided template and adding some liquidity to make pools visible. Next steps are for the user to try the template and for the team to address UX issues mentioned by BasementNodes.
