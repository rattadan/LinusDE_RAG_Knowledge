## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text provided includes several tweets and announcements from the Cosmos Ecosystem and related projects.

First, I need to identify the main updates. The Sputnik Navigation System update allows getting the price of $LIKE in 24 tokens, including Cosmos, Solana, and Mina. They mention a Telegram bot and the implementation of IBC for LikeCoin. That's a key point.

Then there are various tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. One talks about the Band Oracle integration, which is significant for their ecosystem. Another mentions Starname needing votes, so that's a call to action for the community. Sputnik and SifChain partnering to allow tips with $ROWAN is another collaboration highlight.

The pSTAKE conversation on the new forum is about community engagement. SifChain and Cosmostation's partnership relates to IBC wallet. The OmniFlix Network's event with Jack and Garrette discussing NFTs in Cosmos, especially Regen Network, is another key event. They also mention a delay in IBC and a reason, but the user might not need that detail unless it's crucial.

I should structure the summary by project updates and key announcements. Highlight the Sputnik update with LikeCoin price checks, Band Oracle integration, Starname's vote request, Sputnik-SifChain partnership, pSTAKE forum, SifChain-Cosmostation, and the OmniFlix NFT event. Mention the IBC implementation for LikeCoin as a future point. Keep it concise, bullet points might work but the user wants a summary without markdown. So list each main point clearly, ensuring decisions and updates are emphasized. Avoid less critical info like the reason for IBC delay unless specified. Check for any other important tokens or actions, but it seems these are the main ones. Also, note the relevant hashtags and links where necessary, but maybe just the main ones. Make sure to include the key collaborations and community actions like voting and joining forums. Alright, that should cover the essential updates and decisions from the text.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the main topics extracted from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to read through all the messages to identify recurring themes or specific terms.

Looking at the first message from "unknown", it mentions the Sputnik Navigation System update, allowing the price of $LIKE to be checked against 23 tokens from Cosmos, Solana, and Mina Protocol. There's also a link to a Telegram bot and LikeCoin community. So topics here are Sputnik update, $LIKE price, Cosmos Ecosystem, Solana Ecosystem, Mina Protocol, Telegram bot, LikeCoin.

Next, the combot messages from Cosmos Ecosystem's Twitter account. They talk about IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), which is a key protocol in Cosmos. There's a mention of Starname needing votes, Band Oracle integration, and discussions about IBC. So topics here are IBC, Starname, Band Protocol, Cosmos Ecosystem.

Another combot message mentions Sputnik and SifChain collaboration, sending tips with $ROWAN. So SifChain and $ROWAN are added. Then another combot about pSTAKE on the community forum, so pSTAKE. Then SifChain and Cosmostation partnership, IBCwallet. Then OmniFlixNetwork and Jack Zampolin's conversation about NFTs, Garrette from Atomic Form, Season 2 of Conversations with Jack, Sommelier Finance, and the live event. So topics here include OmniFlix Network, Conversations with Jack, NFTs, Atomic Form, SifChain, Cosmostation, pSTAKE, Sommelier Finance, live event, Telegram community.

The user might be looking for a concise list without duplicates. I need to ensure that each topic is mentioned once. Also, check if some terms are variations of the same thing, like Cosmos Ecosystem and Cosmos. But since the text uses both, maybe keep them as is unless they're clearly the same. Also, hashtags like #IBC and #NFTs are already in the text, so include those. 

Wait, the user might want the main topics, so perhaps include the specific tokens like $LIKE, $ROWAN. Also, projects like Sputnik, SifChain, LikeCoin, OmniFlix Network, Band Protocol, pSTAKE, Cosmostation, Sommelier Finance. Technologies

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- https (46 mentions)
- com (39 mentions)
- twitter (38 mentions)
- cosmosecosystem (29 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided a bunch of text messages from different sources, mostly related to the Cosmos Ecosystem and some other projects like LikeCoin, Sputnik, and SifChain. The task is to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I need to go through each message individually and assess their sentiment. Then, I'll aggregate the findings to get the overall sentiment. Let's start with the first message from "unknown" at 2021-07-23T22:17:54. It mentions the Sputnik Navigation System being updated successfully, allowing users to get the actual price for $LIKE with one click. It also lists partnerships with Cosmos Ecosystem, Solana, and Mina Protocol. The tone here seems excited and informative, highlighting a successful update and new features. Words like "successfully updated," "actual price," and "best helper" are positive. So this one is positive.

Next, the combot messages from Cosmos Ecosystem. There are several tweets. The first one on July 23rd at 16:04:34 talks about a daily outpost. That's neutral because it's just a regular update. Then, the one at 16:04:00 mentions Starname needing votes. Encouraging votes is usually positive as it's promoting engagement. The Band Oracle integration at 16:03:26 is positive since integrations are seen as progress. The cool discussion at 16:02:53 uses exclamation marks and "cool," which is positive. The IBC explanation at 16:02:00 might be neutral or positive; it's informative but doesn't have strong negative words. The Sputnik and SifChain partnership at 16:00:39 uses "friends" and mentions new features, so positive. The pSTAKE forum announcement at 15:36:15 encourages joining a conversation, which is positive. The SifChain and Cosmostation partnership at 15:31:28 is also positive. The online event at 15:16:44 uses "right now" and "time to ask," which is positive. 

Then there's svAbhishek's message at 15:02:5

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. First, I need to understand what the text contains. It looks like a series of chat messages and tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem, mentioning various projects and updates.

Starting with the first message from "unknown" about the Sputnik update. They mention that the Sputnik Navigation System is updated and now users can get the actual price for $LIKE in one click, including pairs with tokens from Cosmos, Solana, and Mina. The links provided are for the Telegram bot and the LikeCoin community. So action items here might be to check out the SputnikPriceBot and join the LikeCoin Telegram group.

Next, the combot tweets. The first one is about Starname needing votes. So the action item here is to vote for Starname. Another tweet mentions the Band Oracle integration, which is more of an update than an action item. Then there's a tweet about watching a discussion on Cosmos and Cosmos Voice, so maybe the action is to watch that discussion. The IBC explanation tweet probably doesn't have an action item unless there's a link to learn more, but the user might need to check the link. The Sputnik and SifChain partnership could be an action item to send tips with $ROWAN, but the text says "after implementation of #IBC to LikeCoin," so maybe that's a future step. The pSTAKE forum launch would require joining the conversation there. The SifChain and Cosmostation partnership might be about using the IBC wallet. The OmniFlix live event mentions tuning in at a specific time, so that's an action item. The last message from svAbhishek is a reminder about the live talk on NFTs, so again, watching that.

I need to go through each message and identify any verbs that imply action: "join," "watch," "vote," "learn," "send," "tune in," "interact," "follow," "spread the word." Then, check if these actions are directed at the user. For example, "Join the Community of LikeCoin in Telegram" is a direct instruction. The tweets about Band Oracle being integrated are more informational, so no action needed. The pSTAKE one says to join the conversation, so that's an action item. The live event at 3pm UTC
