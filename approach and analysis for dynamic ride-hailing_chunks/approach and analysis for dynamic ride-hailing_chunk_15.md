I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

They discretize the service area by considering a finite set of
stations where vehicles can idle and customers enter and exit vehicles. Requests are rejected when a customer arrives at a station and there is
currently no vacant vehicle available. Zhang and Pavone (2016) aim to
balance demand and supply while minimizing the average number of
repositioning vehicles. Braverman et al. (2019) maximize the revenue
gained from serving requests. Both papers provide theoretically optimal
solutions for their specific problem formulations. Lastly, there are some approaches that combine assignment and
repositioning decisions into one single strategy. Kullman et al. (2021)
present such a combined approach based on reinforcement learning. In Al-Kanj et al. (2020), approximate dynamic programming is used and
pricing strategies are introduced to balance supply and demand. Guo
et al. (2021) present a matching-integrated vehicle rebalancing model
to optimize service rate and costs. A comparable approach is used
in Dandl et al.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk explains the concept of dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems, specifically focusing on the discretization of the service area and the decision-making process involved.

**Technical details:**

* The service area is discretized into a finite set of stations where vehicles can idle.
* Requests are rejected if a customer arrives at a station when there is currently no vacant vehicle available.
* Zhang and Pavone (2016) propose a solution that balances demand and supply while minimizing the average number of repositioning vehicles.

**Context:**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by introducing the main topic of dynamic dispatch in ride-hailing systems. The references provided earlier (Bischoff & Maciejewski, 2016; Braverman et al., 2019) and specific papers like Zhang and Pavone (2016) and Kullman et al. (2021) have already discussed the concepts of demand forecasting and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.

The current chunk connects to these surrounding contexts by:

* Introducing the concept of dynamic dispatch, which is a crucial aspect of ride-hailing system management.
* Building upon previous research on demand forecasting and repositioning strategies.
* Mentioning specific papers that have already addressed similar topics.

**Requirements and conditions:**

None are explicitly mentioned in this chunk. However, it's essential to note that the provided references and context suggest that dynamic dispatch is a complex problem requiring careful consideration of various factors, such as:

* Discretization of the service area
* Demand forecasting accuracy
* Vehicle repositioning efficiency
* Pricing strategies for supply and demand balance

The requirements and conditions mentioned in this chunk are implicit, as they pertain to the underlying assumptions and constraints of ride-hailing system management.
