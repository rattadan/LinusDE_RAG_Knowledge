# User Analysis: AirdropGlideapp

## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's break down this query. The user provided several tweets from an account called AirdropGlideapp, and they want a summary of the main topics, language style, legitimacy evaluation, the project they advertise, and the author's character. Plus, five keywords.

First, I need to look at the content of each tweet. The first one is about remembering accounts that told someone to buy $OM after a price crash. That seems related to crypto trading, maybe a specific token. The second tweet mentions getting 300 Yaps from KaitoAI, which is a token or project, and asks how others are doing. The third tweet is about Cosmos and DEXes, specifically mentioning SkipProtocol, Osmosis, Stride Swap, etc. The fourth tweet is critical of projects that add vesting periods for airdrops, mentioning MANTRA_Chain and milky_way_zone. 

So the main topics are crypto airdrops, token projects (like OM, KaitoAI, Cosmos), DEXes, and critiques of vesting periods. The language is informal, uses emojis, and has a lot of mentions of projects. The tone is somewhat urgent and critical, especially in the last tweet. 

Legitimacy-wise, the account is promoting airdrop-related projects but also pointing out issues with some projects. The author might be a crypto enthusiast or a developer in the space. The character traits: the author seems to be knowledgeable about crypto projects, maybe a developer or a community member. They might be motivated by helping others or critiquing bad practices. Emotional patterns could be concerned about project sustainability. Decision-making is likely based on community feedback and project developments.

The keywords should reflect the main themes: crypto airdrops, DEXs, vesting periods, token projects, and Cosmos ecosystem. 

Wait, the user also mentioned the account's project. The name is AirdropGlideApp, which suggests they might be a platform for airdrops. The main project here is probably related to airdrops and token distribution in the crypto space. 

I need to make sure I don't miss any key points. The author is likely in the crypto community, focusing on airdrops and DEXs. They might be trying to inform others about projects or highlight issues. The evaluation of legitimacy is mixedâ€”some projects are being criticized, others are being promoted. The author's character is probably someone who's active in the community, values transparency, and is critical of poor project practices.

| messages | Finally got over 300 @KaitoAI Yaps!

Getting them is not easy. Interested to hear how you're doing? https://t.co/1ydzChgCY0 |
| messages | Cosmos has got so many DEXes right now, that I just hope that @SkipProtocol integrates them all in to one easy to use front end...

Can anyone name all the DEXes we have?

I'll start...

@osmosiszone
@astroport_fi
@axvdex
@WhiteWhaleDefi 
@elys_network 
@Dojo_Swap 
@HelixApp_ |
| messages | Wow, Cosmos is getting a whole new DEX, Stride Swap, purpose-built for IBC Eureka and the Cosmos Hub.

Big W for @stride_zone!

Big L for @osmosiszone?

I thought something strange was going on, when Osmosis didn't add any of the new IBC Eureka varients (ETH, wBTC, USDT etc) to https://t.co/pfefdFbbo0 |

| messages | Projects should have more confidence in their own token, instead of vesting airdrops for up to 2 years.

@MANTRA_Chain was guilty of this (added a 2 year vest at the last minute) and now the day before claim day, @milky_way_zone have added a 1 year vest.

Not ideal. |
