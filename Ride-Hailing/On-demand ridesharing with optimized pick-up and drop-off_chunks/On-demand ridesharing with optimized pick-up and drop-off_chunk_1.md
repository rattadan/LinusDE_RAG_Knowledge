Pick-up and drop-off points
Ridepooling

On-demand systems in which passengers with similar routes can share a vehicle are expected to
become a relevant part of future mobility, thanks to their flexibility and their potential impact on
reducing congestion. Nevertheless, due to the long detours required by a door-to-door scheme,
they induce extra costs to the users in terms of delay.
