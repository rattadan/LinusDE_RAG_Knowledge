## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 46

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

These two cases
should be kept in mind when comparing repositioning strategies against
the nearest strategy as the only benchmark, especially for completely
machine learning-based approaches, which usually start their training
progress with the random strategy. In the remainder of this section, we present additional approaches
that reposition the whole (non-serving) fleet in regular intervals of ùõøùëÖ . Since these approaches create a plan for the whole fleet, they are not
used whenever a vehicle enters the null state. Here, unless otherwise
stated, the vehicle is provisionally sent to its nearest parking lot until
the next repositioning epoch occurs. Match missed requests. The match missed requests strategy is a
slightly modified version of the one proposed by Alonso-Mora et al. (2017) for a ride-sharing application. In their study, it is possible that
after an assignment epoch, there are still unmatched open requests
and unassigned available vehicles.
