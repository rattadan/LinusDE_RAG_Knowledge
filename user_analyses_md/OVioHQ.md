Putting these tweets in bigger context of the author's intentions:
These tweets collectively show an organization (Outlier Ventures) that is trying to position itself as a thoughtful, substantive player in the Web3 investment space. They're consciously distancing themselves from hype-driven approaches to blockchain and AI. Their intention appears to be:
- To establish credibility as serious investors looking at long-term potential

- To educate their audience about what they see as the most important aspects of decentralized AI (trust, coordination, infrastructure)
- To showcase their focus on building real companies and not following transient trends
- To network with others interested in these technologies through event promotion

The repeated emphasis on "not hype, not trends, not noise" suggests they're trying to differentiate themselves in a space that they perceive as being saturated with short-term thinking and shallow approaches to Web3 and AI.
