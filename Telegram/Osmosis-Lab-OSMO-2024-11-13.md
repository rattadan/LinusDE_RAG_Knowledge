## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of chat messages, so I need to parse through the timestamps and authors to find the main issues.

First, looking at the messages from Chessmany3k and mikebarb, there's a recurring problem with the Wormhole bridge causing delays in fund transfers. They mention that transfers are taking days, and there's a concern about large amounts being stuck. The key point here is the delay issue with Wormhole, especially when using Osmosis app for deposits/withdrawals. They also suggest that a warning should be posted in the Osmosis app to inform users about these risks.

Then, there's a discussion about a failed upgrade on Noble chain that caused downtime, which is related to the Wormhole delays. Mikebarb mentions that validators are waiting on relayers to manually upgrade. This seems important because it's the root cause of the problem.

Other users like crystalball0 and profesija are dealing with liquidity issues on Osmosis and trying to find CEXs that support specific token versions. They mention MEXC and Fin as alternatives, but this might not be as critical as the main bridge problem.

There's also a proposal by JohnnyWyles to increase the ckBTC limit, but it's from a forum link and might not be a decision yet. The status update from osmogovbot includes this proposal, but it's not a resolved decision.

The Osmosis team's response is mentioned, with devs working on a fix and advising to check the support site. However, users are frustrated with the lack of updates and status pages from Wormhole.

Putting this together, the main points are the Wormhole bridge delays affecting Osmosis users, the need for warnings about these delays, the failed Noble chain upgrade causing the issue, and the lack of communication from Wormhole. The decisions would be the suggestion to add warnings and the ongoing fix by Osmosis devs. Other topics like liquidity and CEX support are secondary but should be noted briefly.

I need to ensure the summary is structured, highlighting the key issues, causes, user concerns, and the actions taken or suggested. Avoid including less relevant messages like the charts praise or unrelated questions. Keep it concise, maybe in bullet points or a short paragraph, focusing on the critical elements.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand what the text is about. Let me skim through the messages.

Looking at the usernames and the timestamps, it seems like a conversation on a platform like Discord or Slack, possibly related to cryptocurrency and blockchain. The names mention Osmosis, Wormhole, Cosmos chains, and various tokens like USDT, USDC, BTC, and CRO. There's talk about transfers taking days, network issues, warnings needed on apps, and some discussions about liquidity and exchanges.

So the main topics here are likely around blockchain transactions, specifically using Wormhole for cross-chain transfers, delays in transaction confirmations, issues with Osmosis app and its integration with Wormhole, network problems on Cosmos chains, and maybe the need for better user warnings or disclosures. Also, there's a mention of a failed upgrade and validators, which points to network downtime or maintenance. Some users are discussing liquidity problems on exchanges like MEXC and swapping tokens. Additionally, there's a part about Chainscope explorer being back online and price feed errors.

I should group these into topics. Let's see:

1. Wormhole network delays and transaction confirmations.
2. Osmosis app directing users to Wormhole for deposits/withdrawals without adequate warnings.
3. Lack of disclosure and need for user alerts about transfer delays.
4. Cosmos chain network issues and relayer problems.
5. Cross-chain transfers (IBC) failing or taking too long.
6. Discussions about liquidity on exchanges like MEXC and swapping tokens.
7. Failed upgrade and validator-related network halts.
8. Chainscope explorer status and support.
9. Price feed errors and display issues on Osmosis.
10. Security concerns and fund risks during delays.

Wait, some of these might overlap. For example, Wormhole delays and IBC transfer issues are related. Also, the mention of US regulators stepping into crypto might be a separate topic. Let me check again.

The user Chessmany3k mentions US regulators getting involved in crypto regulation. That's a regulatory topic. Then there's a proposal about Alloyed BTC's static limit increase. That's a governance topic. The part about sending funds to Sui network and the ticket system with Wormhole support is about transaction delays and support processes. Also, some users are asking about which CEX

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, so I need to analyze the sentiment of this text. Let me start by reading through all the messages to get a sense of what's going on. 

The user is Chessmany3k, and they're talking about issues with the Wormhole network when using Osmosis app for transferring funds. They mention that transfers are taking days, and there's a lack of disclosure about this. Other users like mikebarb and Svansy are also discussing delays and problems with transactions, relayers, and syncing issues. There's a mention of a failed upgrade and waiting for consensus. Some users are frustrated, like Svansy saying they lost two months' rent on an exploit, which is pretty negative.

On the other hand, there are some positive comments. SoulRa1ser praises the new Advanced Charts on Osmosis, saying they're next level and amazing. profesija and kychuli also compliment the explorer, calling it the best and supporting the team. These are positive sentiments. 

But the majority of the text is about problems: delays in transfers, network issues, lack of status updates, warnings about using Wormhole, and concerns about funds being stuck. Even though some users are hopeful that things will be resolved soon, the overall tone seems more negative because of the repeated complaints and the mention of financial loss. 

I should check if there are any neutral parts. The messages from the bots like osmosis_statbot providing support links are neutral. Also, some technical discussions about liquidity and checking transaction hashes might be neutral. But the user comments are mostly either negative or positive. 

Putting it all together, there are several negative comments about the service issues, some positive feedback on features, and a few neutral statements. The negative sentiments seem to outweigh the positive ones, especially with the urgency of the problems affecting transactions and funds. So the overall sentiment is probably negative.
</think>

The sentiment of the provided text is **negative**. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Negative Themes Dominant**: 
   - Multiple users (Chessmany3k, mikebarb, Svansy) express frustration over prolonged transaction delays via Wormhole, lack of transparency, and unresolved issues with fund transfers. 
   - Concerns about financial risks (e.g., "lost 2 month rents on that exploit") and urgent calls for warnings/app updates highlight dissatisfaction.
   - Technical problems (syncing issues, failed upgrades, "waiting for consensus") are recurring

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, and next steps from this chat text. The user provided a long list of messages from different users, and I need to go through each one to identify any tasks or decisions that need to be made.

Starting from the top, Chessmany3k at 23:34:31 says they've said their peace and hope it's resolved soon. That doesn't seem like an action item, just a closing thought. Then at 23:32:06, they mention US regulators waiting to regulate crypto because of lack of disclosure. Maybe that's a point about regulatory concerns but not an action item here. 

At 23:31:17, Chessmany3k says users should be made aware that transfers can take days. That sounds like a suggestion, so maybe an action item to inform users. Then mikebarb at 23:31:13 talks about a delay not being common and wishing for a status page. So another possible action item: create a status page. 

Chessmany3k at 23:30:36 mentions a large transfer could be problematic, and at 23:29:46 suggests putting a warning on the Osmosis app. So that's a clear action item: add a warning. 

mikebarb's message at 23:29:04 says they responded and will notify devs of the transaction. So action item: notify devs about the tx. 

Chessmany3k at 23:28:32 says they received an update from the ticket, but it's not clear what the action is. Maybe the devs are working on a fix, so that's a decision. 

Earlier, Chessmany3k at 22:49:08 mentions Wormhole has issues with Cosmos chains. Then there's a discussion about checking the bridge status and sending tx hashes. So actions like checking bridge status, sending tx hashes for updates. 

crystalball0 at 22:26:26 has a liquidity issue on Osmosis, so maybe next step is to find another CEX with better liquidity. 

Yusungsang at 16:44:24 says it's a Wormhole problem, not Osmosis, so users should contact Wormhole support.
