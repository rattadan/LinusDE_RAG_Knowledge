I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

(2019), where a matching problem for the assignment is solved while considering fleet unbalances introduced by the
assignment. most studies limit assignments to vehicles that are not currently serving a
request (non-serving), other studies allow the assignment of all vehicles. Here, the current customer is first dropped off before the new customer
is picked up. Two studies compare the quality of both versions with
each other. The articles also use different objective functions. Most
often, combinations of service rate (SR), customer waiting time (WT),
and profit or costs have to be optimized. The table reveals that a
maximum waiting time restriction is only applied in the listed studies
when delaying the response is allowed. Additionally, delayed responses
are considered more often, most likely due to the increased complexity
of corresponding solution approaches. Finally, we observe that only in
the studies of Kullman et al. (2021) and Maciejewski et al.
