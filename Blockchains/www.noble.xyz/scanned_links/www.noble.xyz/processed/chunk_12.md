### Implementation Details  
- **Seed Round**: Raised $3.3M via Polychain Capital, Borderless Capital, and Circle Ventures, with the goal of launching the mainnet.  
- **CCTP Integration**: USDC (native stablecoin) is issued via CCTP and can be spent on platforms like Coinbase.  
- **Deposit Process**: Users can deposit USDC directly to Coinbase in 2 seconds, highlighting fast transaction speeds.  
- **IBC Interoperability**: Enables cross-chain asset transfers (e.g., moving funds between CEXs and DEXs).  
- **Stablecoin Liquidity**: Noble aims to address Cosmos' liquidity gaps by providing a native stablecoin.  

### Related Topics
