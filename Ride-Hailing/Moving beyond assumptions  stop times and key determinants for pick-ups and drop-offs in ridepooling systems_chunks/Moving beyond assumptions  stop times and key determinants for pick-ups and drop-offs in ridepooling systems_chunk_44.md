**Original Text:**

That finding is consistent with Rashidi, Ataeian,
and Ranjitkar (2023) who discovered that bus dwell times are longer at sheltered stops compared to unsheltered ones, attributed to the enhanced comfort provided. Concerning the
impact of passengersâ€™ age on stop time, our results align with those of Rashidi, Ataeian, and
Ranjitkar (2023) and Tirachini (2013), who determined that elderly travelers need more time
for the boarding and alighting process in PT systems. One of the primary factors contributing to extended ridepooling stop times is the
(un)loading of bulky baggage, a challenge also observed in PT bus dwells (Daamen, Lee, and
Wiggenraad 2008). Additionally, we discovered that passenger delays significantly impact
boarding stop times. Ridepooling simulations typically assume that passengers are punctual at the assigned PUDO locations, so this issue is often overlooked in studies.
