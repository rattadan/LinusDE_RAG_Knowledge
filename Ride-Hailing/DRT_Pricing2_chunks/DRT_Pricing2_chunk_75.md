## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 75

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

To summarize, while the service rate can be slightly
increased by preferring shorter requests, considering the distances to
the pickup locations seems to be the most appropriate way to calculate
the costs. What is the influence of integrating the first-come-first-serve
method into the matching approach? If there are more open requests
than available vehicles in a matching epoch, preference can be given
to the requests waiting the longest. This ensures that no customer will
receive an answer before all the other customers that called earlier. Fig. 2 shows an example of the notification time of the customers in a
setting without a maximum waiting time, once without (left) and once
with (right) first-come-first-serve integration. The matching interval is
ùõøùëÄ = 60 s, and all requests can be matched within the first matching
epoch, except in the last third of the planning horizon. There, however,
the demand exceeds the supply and some requests have to be postponed
to subsequent matching epochs.
