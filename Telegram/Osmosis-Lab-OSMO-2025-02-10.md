## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. First, I'll go through each message and identify the important information.

Starting from the top, osmosis_statbot mentions the support site. Not sure if that's critical, but maybe note it as a resource. AtlasStaking1 joined the Osmosis validators, promoting their partnership with delegators. That's a key point about their involvement.

Then there's a conversation between user_6658531403 and ParaFl0w discussing Dogecoin's use case. The user says Doge is an L1 network, and others question its utility. But the main decision here is probably the proposal to use USDC for DOGE liquidity on Osmosis. Yusungsang's message confirms the proposal passed. The proposal details are in the long message from Yusungsang. They're using margin bolts to provide liquidity in a specific price range, buying $100k DOGE and depositing $50k in margin bolts. The goal is to attract traders, increase fees, and exposure. Also mentions previous issues with BTC liquidity.

Then there's a discussion about other validators (Khuwarzmi and profesija) regarding adding liquidity and proposal 900. The user_6352038770 comments on Cosmos having too many pools and fragmented liquidity, advocating for real apps. Then solja0075 and griffin_web3 talk about APR issues in liquidity pools, possibly a bug. Eurmay asks about Mantra's price discrepancy but later finds the answer.

So the main points are:
1. Proposal 900 passed to use $150k USDC for DOGE liquidity on Osmosis using margin bolts.
2. Validator AtlasStaking1 joined Osmosis.
3. Community discussions on Dogecoin's use case and Osmosis's role.
4. Issues with APR not showing in some pools, suspected frontend bugs.
5. Concerns about liquidity fragmentation in Cosmos and the need for real applications.

I need to structure this concisely, highlighting decisions and key points without the back-and-forth. Maybe start with the proposal approval, then the validator addition, followed by community feedback and technical issues. Avoid including every message but group related ones. Check if all the important details from Yusungsang's message are covered: the use of

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided chat messages and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or subjects.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's about visiting the support site. That's straightforward‚Äîsupport site promotion. Then AtlasStaking1 mentions joining the Osmosis validators and delegators as partners. So validator announcement and delegator relations. JohnnyWyles87's message is just a response, maybe not a topic. Jasbanza tags a user and says "dm," so direct message request or private communication.

Osmosis_news shares a Twitter link, so social media updates. The next few messages from user_6658531403 talk about sniping bots, cosmos sniping, and the need for them. Then there's a mention of mobile-apps, dApps, trading bots, and AI bots‚Äîso job offer or collaboration request. The user also discusses DOGE as a cryptocurrency, its use case, and comparing it to Litecoin. That's Dogecoin (DOGE) discussion, use cases, and maybe crypto comparisons.

ParaFl0w asks about the use case of Doge and the number of L1 networks. So L1 networks and crypto use cases. Yusungsang talks about a proposal passing related to using USDC in the community pool for DOGE liquidity on Osmosis DEX. That's proposal 900, USDC funding, DOGE liquidity. The proposal details include using margin bolts, so maybe DeFi strategies or margin financing.

Other messages mention issues with APR not showing in liquidity pools, frontend bugs, filtering APRs. So liquidity pool APR issues, technical bugs. Eurmay asks about Mantra's price discrepancy on Osmosis, leading to discussions on RWA (Real World Assets) and token representation. That's token price discrepancies and RWA tokenization.

Another user talks about Cosmos having too many pools and chains with fragmented liquidity, advocating for real user apps. So fragmented liquidity, IBC/Dex challenges. There's also a mention of a merge with Thorchain and Kujira's IBC enablement, insolvency issues. So Thorchain-Kujira merge, insolvency concerns.

Putting this all together, the main topics seem to be:

- Osmosis validators (AtlasStaking1

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- osmosis (15 mentions)
- doge (10 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. First, I need to go through each message and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The user provided a list of chat messages from different users on a platform related to Osmosis, which seems to be a blockchain or cryptocurrency project.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a bot providing a support link. Bots usually just relay info without sentiment, so that's neutral.

Next, AtlasStaking1 says they're proud to join Osmosis validators and want personal contact with delegators. Words like "proud" and "partners" indicate a positive sentiment.

JohnnyWyles87's message is "As you wish ;)" which is a bit ambiguous. The semicolon could imply sarcasm, but without context, it's safer to mark as neutral.

jasbanza tags someone and says "dm" which is just a request for direct message. Neutral.

osmosis_news shares a Twitter link. Since it's a news link without explicit opinion, neutral.

user_6658531403 asks about sniping on Cosmos. Sniping might relate to trading, but the question itself doesn't show sentiment. Neutral.

Same user then says "We need sniping bots." Again, a request or statement without clear positive or negative words. Neutral.

Another user offers help with various apps and bots. The offer to assist is positive.

user_6658531403 has a series of messages. "You will have a coin" and "Everything is gonna be a coin..." seem neutral statements. Then "Not saying that is a good thing" and "Most coins have no use" are negative. "Fast payment" is positive. The part about being designed with no idea case but like Litecoin is negative because "no idea case" sounds critical.

ParaFl0w asks about use case, which is neutral. User_6658531403 responds "It's a crypto" ‚Äì neutral. Then ParaFl0w asks about L1 networks, neutral.

Sinzfeldt mentions no controversial feedback and asks to get it on chain. The "please" emoji might indicate eagerness, but the message itself is neutral.

Yusungsang's message: "It passed!" with details about a proposal. The exclamation could be positive, but the content is factual. However,

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I'll read through the entire conversation to understand the context. 

Looking at the messages, there's a lot of discussion about Osmosis validators, proposals, liquidity pools, and some questions about Dogecoin and APRs. The user wants me to identify any specific actions that need to be taken, decisions made, or next steps mentioned.

Starting from the top, the first message from osmosis_statbot is a link to support, which might not be an action item but just information. Then AtlasStaking1 announces joining the active set of validators and provides a link. That's more of an announcement than an action item.

JohnnyWyles87's message is just a response, not an action. Jasbanza tags BasementNodes with "dm," which might mean direct message, so maybe someone needs to contact them. That could be an action item. 

Osmosis_news shares a Twitter link, probably just for information. User_6658531403 has several messages discussing crypto, Doge, liquidity sniping, and mentions needing sniping bots. The line "We need sniping bots" might be an action item. Also, when they say "You will have a coin," but that's vague.

Then there's a message from user_7164487109 offering help with mobile apps, dApps, bots, etc. Maybe that's a decision to collaborate or a next step if the team accepts the offer.

Looking at Yusungsang's message, they mention a passed proposal using USDC to secure DOGE liquidity on Osmosis. The proposal details include buying DOGE with USDC, depositing in Margin Bolt, and links to the proposal and trade page. This seems like a key decision or next step. The proposal link and method details would be important here.

Khuwarzmi and profesija discuss proposal 900, which has passed. Khuwarzmi provides a link to the proposal, and Yusungsang's message explains the proposal's content. So, the action items here might be related to implementing the proposal, like executing the Margin Bolt deposits or monitoring the liquidity.

Other messages from user_6352038770 talk about issues with liquidity and APR not showing up in some pools. Sol
