will dramatically extend their sales cycle and increase the odds that their startup will lose momentum before their product ever reaches the market.Â

Founders should prepare for the Codebase program by developing specific customer profiles for their idea and they should be able to demonstrate that they have connectionsâor at least a way to make themâto potential users in their target market. Although Codebase provides significant executive storytelling coaching throughout the 10 week program, founders should also come prepared with a compelling story about their idea that will help them get investors and customers to sign on the dotted line once their product is built.Â

Team dynamics play an equally crucial role in preparing for the Codebase program. Martin advises that founders should trust their team because they are going to be spending a lot of time together. Strong interpersonal relationships and complementary skill sets within the founding team help mitigate potential conflicts that could derail even the most promising projects. Before applying, teams should honestly assess their working relationships and ensure they have the right mix of skills to execute their vision.

One of the hallmarks ofa successful Codebase teamis the ability to quickly make decisions and execute on them. The Codebase program encourages exploration and founders regularly pivot to new ideas during the program. Founders will constantly receive feedback on their ideas from Ava Labsâ network of operators, investors, and other mentors, and they are expected to use this feedback to rapidly iterate on their product.Â

âItâs important for founders to have a scalable idea, access to customers, and a go-to-market strategy, but more than anything success in this program is about being decisive," Martin says.
