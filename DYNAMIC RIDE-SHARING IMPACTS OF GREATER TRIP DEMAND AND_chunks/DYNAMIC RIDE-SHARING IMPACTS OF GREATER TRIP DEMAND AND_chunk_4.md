## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 4

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

en-route further reduce operator costs (per passenger-mile served) by increasing average vehicle
occupancy or “AVO”. TNC services are helping lower personal vehicle registrations per capita
across the U.S., especially in rural states that are typically auto-centric (Ward et al., 2019), and
more dramatic reductions are expected (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015; Quarles et al., 2019; Kim
et al., 2020). Fully-automated or “autonomous” vehicles (AVs) are expected to lower TNC travel
costs (Chen et al., 2016; Loeb and Kockelman, 2019; Becker et al., 2020). Consequently,
operating costs are expected to be comparable to the bundled cost of owning and operating a
personal vehicle (Walker and Johnson, 2016) and should deliver larger mode splits toward
shared-fleet vehicles. Huang et al.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Analysis of the text chunk:

1. Technical details: The technical parameters described in this chunk include:
   - Congestion pricing with self-driving cars (no specific details mentioned)
   - Parking needs for shared fleets
   - Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
2. Context connection and building upon surrounding context:
   This chunk connects to the surrounding context by referencing a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports on shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.
   It also builds upon this context by introducing specific studies mentioned (e.g., Ward et al., 2019; Quarles et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020) that support the expected reductions in TNC travel costs and operating costs.
3. Requirements and conditions:
   The only requirement or condition mentioned is the need for a user license from Elsevier, but this is not directly related to the content of the chunk.

Analysis:

This section appears to be providing technical information on shared autonomous vehicles' potential impacts, specifically regarding congestion pricing, parking needs, and optimization techniques. It references specific studies that support these claims and highlights the expected benefits of shared autonomous vehicle fleets in reducing TNC travel costs and operating costs.

The text also includes a call for more information or clarification from the reader, which may indicate a need to provide additional context or support data for certain aspects of the topic. Overall, this chunk seems to be setting up the surrounding discussion on shared autonomous vehicles and their potential benefits.
