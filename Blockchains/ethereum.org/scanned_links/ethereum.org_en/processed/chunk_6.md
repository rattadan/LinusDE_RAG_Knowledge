### Document Overview  
The content provides an overview of stablecoins on the Ethereum ecosystem, their types, usage, and related features like lending, interest earnings, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Stablecoins**: Pegged assets (e.g., Dai, USDC) that maintain value close to a fiat currency.  
- **Market Capitalization**: Total value of a token based on its supply and price.  
- **Lending Pools**: Platforms enabling users to borrow stablecoins as collateral, with interest earned.  
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: Platforms for trading tokens, including stablecoins.  
- **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**: Expected interest rate for stablecoins, influenced by supply/demand dynamics.  
- **Collateral**: Tokens used as security for loans in lending pools.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Stablecoin Types**: Dai (pegged to USD), USDC (fiat-backed), TUSD, USDT (popular trading pairs).  
- **Lending Mechanisms**: Users can deposit stablecoins into lending pools to earn interest (e.g., $COMP token).  
- **DEX Usage**: Stablecoins are traded on DEXs, with geographic restrictions and direct purchases via wallets.  
- **Interest Earnings**: DApps allow real-time interest earning on stablecoins via lending pools.  

### Related Topics  
- **Ethereum DApps**: Stablecoins are often used in dapps for everyday transactions.  
- **Compound Protocol**: Integrates with lending pools to offer interest earnings.  
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Stablecoins are central to DeFi ecosystems, including lending, borrowing, and trading.

There are hundreds of stablecoins available. Here are some to help you get started. If you're new to Ethereum, we recommend doing some research first.

These are probably the best-known examples of stablecoins right now and the coins we've found useful when using dapps.

Dai is probably the most famous decentralized stablecoin. Its value is roughly a dollar and its accepted widely across dapps.

USDC is probably the most famous fiat-backed stablecoin. Its value is roughly a dollar and its backed by Circle and Coinbase.

Market capitalisation isthe total number of tokens that exist multiplied by the value per token. This list is dynamic and the projects listed here are not necessarily endorsed by the ethereum.org team.

You can pick up most stablecoins on decentralized exchanges. So you can swap any tokens you might have for a stablecoin you want.

A lot of exchanges and wallets let you buy stablecoins directly. Geographical restrictions will apply.

You can earn stablecoins by working on projects within the Ethereum ecosystem.

You can borrow some stablecoins by using crypto as collateral, which you have to pay back.

Check out Ethereums dapps stablecoins are often more useful for everyday transactions.

Stablecoins often have an above-average interest rate because theres a lot of demand for borrowing them. There are dapps that let you earn interest on your stablecoins in real time by depositing them into a lending pool. Just like in the banking world, you're supplying tokens for borrowers but you can withdraw your tokens and your interest at any time.

Put your stablecoin savings to good use and earn some interest. Like everything in crypto, the predicted Annual Percentage Yields (APY) can change day-to-day dependent on real-time supply/demand.

Markets for lots of stablecoins, including Dai, USDC, TUSD, USDT, and more.

Lend stablecoins and earn interest and $COMP, Compound's own token.
