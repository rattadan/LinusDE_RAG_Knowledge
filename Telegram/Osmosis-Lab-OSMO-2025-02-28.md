## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary request. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text provided is a series of chat messages from different users on a platform, possibly related to Osmosis blockchain.

First, I need to identify which messages are important. The bot messages from osmosis_statbot are just directing to support, so maybe not crucial. The main updates seem to come from jim_batan: announcing a return to 5% commission on Osmosis chain starting March 1st. That's a key point because it affects stakers' rewards. Then there's a user issue with transferring ATONE from Osmosis to Keplr mentioned by kokoro_star, which indicates a current problem. 

Other messages like user_7164487109 wanting to DM an admin and griffin_web3 stating that admins don't DM are interactions about communication policies. Yusungsang's "Coins that won't fail" and Sinzfeldt's "Price fatigue" might be opinions or comments but not actionable decisions. The message from user_5642624394 asking about OSMO and kychuli's response about buying OSMO on exchanges are informational but not major decisions. 

The support ticket mention by kychuli and the user needing help transferring NGM coins to Osmosis are also issues that require support. ARCHIEARI001's question about a project listing is another query. 

So the key points are the commission change to 5%, the ATONE transfer issue, the DM policy clarification, and the various support queries. The decisions here are the commission adjustment effective March 1st. The rest are user issues or informational messages. I should structure the summary to highlight the commission change as the main decision, then note the technical issue and the support-related interactions. Keep it concise, so maybe bullet points or a short paragraph. Avoid including too many details like the specific links unless necessary, but the user wants key points, so the date and effect of the commission change are important. Also, mention the ATONE problem and the DM policy clarification. Other messages can be grouped as support requests or general inquiries.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as comma-separated. First, I need to go through each message and figure out what the key topics are.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot, it's a recurring support message directing users to the support site. That seems like a support resource topic. Then, the next message by jim_batan talks about commission levels dropping to 5% on the Osmosis chain, which relates to staking rewards. So that's staking and commission rates.

Then there's user_7164487109 trying to contact admins via DM, but griffin_web3 says admins don't DM. That's about communication policies. Another message from the same user thanking an admin and asking about DMs, which reinforces the communication topic.

Next, griffin_web3 mentions a ticket, and kokoro_star reports an issue transferring Atone from Osmosis to Keplr. That's a technical issue or transaction problem. Then another support message from osmosis_statbot again, which we can already note as a recurring topic.

Sinzfeldt mentions "Price fatigue," which is a market sentiment topic. Yusungsang talks about "Coins that won't fail," which might relate to investment security or confidence. user_5642624394 asks about opinions on OSMO, which is about coin evaluation. kychuli provides info on buying OSMO through exchanges, so that's purchasing information. ARCHIEARI001 asks if a project is listed, which is about project listings or partnerships. Lastly, user_5128177978 needs help transferring NGM coins from E-money to Osmosis, which is another transaction or cross-chain transfer issue.

Putting it all together, the main topics are support resources, staking rewards/commission rates, communication policies (no DMs), technical issues with transfers, market sentiment (price fatigue), investment security, coin evaluation (OSMO), purchasing information, project listings, and cross-chain transfers. I should make sure each is concise and separated properly.

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. First, I'll go through each message one by one and see what's relevant.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot. It's a standard support message directing users to the support site. Not sure if that's an action item unless someone needs to visit the site, but maybe it's just a recurring message. I'll note it as a possible action if someone needs help, but maybe not necessary unless there's a specific request.

Next, jim_batan's message about the commission level returning to 5% on March 1st. That seems like a decision or next step. Stakeholders should be informed about this change, so expecting the final change on March 1st is a key point. Also, promoting staking with their link and mentioning #restake. So action items here would be the commission change effective March 1st and encouraging staking via the provided link.

Then there's user_7164487109 and griffin_web3 discussing DMs. The admin states they don't DM, so the user needs to be aware not to expect DMs. Maybe the action here is that users shouldn't attempt to DM admins, but it's more of a policy statement. Not sure if that's an action item or just information.

kokoro_star reports an issue transferring atone from Osmosis to Keplr. The action here would be to address this technical problem. Maybe the team needs to look into it, so next steps could involve troubleshooting or escalating the issue.

Sinzfeldt mentions "Price fatigue" and Yusungsang talks about "Coins that won't fail." These seem like general comments without specific actions. The user's message asking about OSMO might prompt a discussion, but unless there's a decision made, not sure if it's actionable.

kychuli's message about buying OSMO on DEX or exchanges like Binance. That's more of an informational response. ARCHIEARI001 asks if the project is listed, which might require checking, but unless there's a decision or next step from that, maybe not.

The user_5128177978 asking how to transfer NGM coins from E-money to Osmosis. kychuli responds by asking to open a support ticket
