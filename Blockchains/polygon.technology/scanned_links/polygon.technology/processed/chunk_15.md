## Source Context
*From: https://polygon.technology/*

### Document Overview  
This content highlights Polygon's 2024 Web3 initiatives, including community grants, AI-driven projects, interoperability efforts, and collaborative events like Aggregation Day at ETHDenver, aimed at advancing Web3 scalability and unity.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Web3 Interoperability**: Focus on connecting blockchain networks (e.g., via Polygon PoS) and fostering unified industry standards.  
- **ZK Proving (Plonky3)**: Polygon’s open-source ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proving system, emphasizing efficiency and scalability.  
- **AI Integration**: Mention of AI as a key driver in the Community Grants Program.  
- **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Polygon’s consensus mechanism for its blockchain network.  
- **Aggregation Day**: Collaborative events promoting interoperability, developer collaboration, and cross-chain innovation.  
- **EthDenver Events**: Aggregated talks and panels featuring leading Web3 projects (e.g., Avail, Starkware, ZKsync).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Community Grants Program Season 2**: Allocates 35M POL (Polygon's native token) to support projects, with AI as a core focus.  
- **Plonky3**: Polygon’s ZK proving framework, claimed to be the fastest ZK system (via benchmarks).  
- **Aggregation Day**: A collaborative event at ETHDenver, featuring technical sessions, talks, and panels from key projects.  
- **Interoperability**: Emphasis on cross-chain protocols (e.g., Polygon PoS) and the role of Aggregation Day in fostering developer collaboration.  
- **Technical Specifications**: Mention of specific grant amounts, project names (e.g., Avail, Starkware), and collaboration frameworks (e.g., cross-pollination of ideas).  

### Related Topics  
- **Aggregation Day**: Connected to ETHDenver events, which are part of Polygon’s broader strategy for developer collaboration.  
- **Web3 Scalability**: The document ties interoperability and scalability to the need for unified industry standards.  
- **ZK Proving**: Linked to the Plonky3 framework and its role in enabling privacy and efficiency in blockchain transactions.  
- **Community Grants**: Part of Polygon’s efforts to build a unified Web3 ecosystem by attracting new users and builders.

Aggregation is all about collaboration, and collaboration starts with conversation.Â

Across three days of Agglayer-related events, core developers and thought leaders across the cryptoverse will probe the challenges and opportunities of interoperability and building a unified Web3.

A brief rundown of aggregated events during ETHDenver, with links to RSVP:

Across three days, these aggregated events bring industry leaders together in a collaborative, positive-sum environment. Itâs a recognition that the movement toward a unified industry is bigger than any single project. Speakers will include technical sessions, talks, and collaborative panels from leading projects that will include: Avail, Axiom, Aztec, Berachain, Brevis, Google, HylÃ©, L2Beat, Larange, Lita Foundation, Miden, Nil Foundation, NovaNet, Offchain Labs, OP Labs, Polygon Labs, RiscZero, The Rollup, Starkware, Succinct, Taiko, Thirdweb, and ZKsync.

All community members are welcome. Cross-pollination is crucial to unity, and a more collaborative industry will bring in new users, builders, and founders.

Building on the experience of AggDay at ETH CC last year, AggDay brings together developers, researchers, and protocol teams for practical and meaningful discussions
