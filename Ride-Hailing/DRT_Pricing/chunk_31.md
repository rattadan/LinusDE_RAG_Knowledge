In this study, k is set to 10 iterations, and n is set to 0.7, that is, for the final 150 iterations, the DRT speed up is
disabled. The approximation approach may easily be improved, e.g. by computing differentiated averages by time
of day or origin-destination-relation.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're referring to a study on traffic routing and dynamic routing theory (DRT). Here's a summary of the information provided:

* The study involves two different approaches: an approximation approach using a single averaged value over time, and another approach that uses differentiated averages by day, origin-destination relation, or other methods.
* In the approximated approach, k (the speed multiplier) is set to 10 iterations, while n (a proportion of total traffic volume) is set to 0.7 for the final 150 iterations.
* This means that during those last 150 iterations, the DRT is disabled, indicating that this approach might not accurately model real-world traffic dynamics.

Improving the approximation approach by using differentiated averages could potentially provide a more accurate representation of traffic flow and routing strategies.
