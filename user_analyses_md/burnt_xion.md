Here's a possible bigger context:

PythNetwork is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Polkadot blockchain. It allows users to create their own decentralized applications (dApps) and interact with other assets on the network. PythNetwork has been gaining popularity in recent months, and its mainnet launch marks an important milestone for the project.
