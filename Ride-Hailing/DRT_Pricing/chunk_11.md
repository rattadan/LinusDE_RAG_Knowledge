**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're discussing the estimated costs of autonomous vehicle services for conventional and shared autonomous vehicles.

You've listed estimates for several scenarios:

1. **Existing services**: Most with existing services on conventional vehicles; transit only a few services (DRT) - This suggests that the current operational costs are relatively low, likely due to economies of scale.
2. **Broad conventional driver-controlled vehicles**: Only a few services experiment with autonomous vehicles - This implies that most drivers are still in control and experimenting with limited autonomy.

Regarding shared autonomous vehicle market introduction:

1. **Lower-bound estimates for cost reduction**: Reduced operating cost is expected to be lower than 0.30 EUR per passenger-km (from 3 to 12).
