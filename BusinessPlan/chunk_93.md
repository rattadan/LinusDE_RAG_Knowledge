Environmental Risks

Description

Mitigation

Blockchain energy consumption.The computing resources
used by blockchains as part of their operation consume
energy in the form of electricity used by nodes running the
underlying software. How this energy is produced (from coal,
to nuclear, to renewable sources) can have different impacts
on the environment. nRide is built on the NKN and Juno blockchains which use
consensus algorithms that are efficient in how they use
computing resources. The NKN and Juno communities are
aware and engaged in the fight for environmental
preservation, and this was an important factor in choosing
them in nRideâ€™s tech stack.
