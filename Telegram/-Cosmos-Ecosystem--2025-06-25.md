## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this summary. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key points and decisions. The user wants a concise summary focusing on those.

Starting with the top message from wlkatja: they announced a new partnership with Venice to deliver onchain AI agents across 100+ blockchains. There's a blog link and some social media shares. That's a major point.

Then imanshabani1994 says "God bless you all" with emojis. Not a key decision, just a positive comment. Probably skip that.

Doncho_MIOFF mentions pushing for Coinbase to list Terra Classic (LUNC). Full article linked. So that's a campaign or initiative they're highlighting.

Asa332 and lunaticlunalover69 have links, but no text. Maybe not important unless context is needed. But since the user wants key points, maybe omit these unless they relate to something else.

LuncEtoroCommunity23 shares a link to a space, but without text, probably not key.

bhatiashaab has two messages: one asking for a LUNC new owner proposal and mentions voting with Nicolas_Boulay. Another says "Okay boss, hope antier solution help us." The first part about a proposal for LUNC owner is a decision point. The second might relate to some solution, but not clear. Maybe note the support for Nicolas_Boulay.

SuperEra announces a campaign worth $40k FLIX, with details in FlixTalk #175. Time and link to the space. So that's a key point about the campaign and an upcoming event.

Igorsoares62 comments that the Vegas plan won't lead to repeg or large burn, supports initiative but cautious. So he's skeptical about the effectiveness of the Vegas plan. Important to note the discussion around repeg and burns.

unknown has a message about a guest for FlixTalk #175, POSTHUMAN DVS, with a space link and reminder. Also, another message about Cosmos Voice #10 event on June 28 discussing Layer Labs, WAVS, AVS infra with Reece Williams and Greg. These are event announcements, so include the campaigns and events.

rcjulin_ForkDAO's "Good morning cosmos" is just a greeting, skip.

cryptobytes906 mentions Josh's feedback on SDK50 proposal

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text and list them as a comma-separated string. First, I need to understand the structure of the text. It looks like a series of chat messages or social media posts, each with a username, timestamp, and content. My job is to go through each of these messages and identify the key topics mentioned.

Starting with the first message from wlkatja, they mention a new partnership with Venice involving censorship-resistant, verifiable AI agents on over 100 blockchains. The main topics here are "New Partnership with Venice" and "Censorship-resistant, verifiable AI agents onchain across 100+ blockchains." There's also a link to an article and some social media shares, but those might be supporting details rather than topics.

Next, imanshabani1994 just says "God bless you all ü´°‚ù§Ô∏èüçª." That seems more like a greeting or expression of goodwill, so maybe not a topic here. 

Doncho_MIOFF talks about Coinbase listing Terra Classic (LUNC). The topic here is "Call for Coinbase to list Terra Classic (LUNC)." The link provided is probably a reference to the full message but not a topic itself.

Asa332 and lunaticlunalover69 share links to Twitter/X posts. Since the content is just a link without additional text, maybe those are not topics unless the links are about specific subjects. But without context from the links, I can't extract topics from them. So perhaps ignore those.

LuncEtoroCommunity23 shares a link to a Twitter Space, which might be an event. However, without knowing the content of the space, it's hard to say. The user might expect me to note the mention of the event, but maybe not. The previous message from SuperEra mentions a campaign worth $FLIX and joining a space. The topics there could be "FlixTalk #175 campaign worth $40,000 FLIX" and "Twitter/X Space announcement for FlixTalk #175." Similarly, the unknown user mentions a guest on FlixTalk #175 with POSTHUMAN DVS, so that's part of the same campaign event.

Then there's Igorsoares62 discussing the Vegas plan not leading to repeg or large burns. The topics

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people, and I need to figure out the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll start by reading through each message individually to understand the context. The first message from wlkatja is about a new partnership with Venice, using emojis like üî• and üëæ, which seem positive. Words like "pleasure," "joining forces," and "censorship-resistant" are positive indicators. So that's definitely positive.

Next, imanshabani1994 says "God bless you all ü´°‚ù§Ô∏èüçª". The emojis here are respectful and positive, so that's a positive sentiment too.

Doncho_MIOFF is advocating for Coinbase to list Terra Classic (LUNC). The message itself is a call to action but doesn't have clear positive or negative words. It's more of a suggestion, so maybe neutral unless there's an underlying positive push. But since it's a proposal without explicit sentiment, I'll lean neutral.

Asa332 and the following few messages (lunaticlunalover69, LuncEtoroCommunity23) just share links without any text. Without content, it's hard to gauge sentiment. They might be neutral, just sharing information.

Bhatiashaab's messages: "Soon please make a proposal for lunc new owner" and "Okay boss Hope antier solution help us". The first is a request, which could be neutral or slightly positive if hopeful. The second expresses hope, so maybe positive. But the wording is a bit ambiguous. I'll check if "antier" is a typo for "Antier"? If it's a company or project name, then hoping their solution helps would be positive.

SuperEra announces a campaign with $FLIX, using **bold** and emojis like üëÄ, üóì, ‚è∞, and a link. The exclamation "Full details dropping" sounds excited, so positive.

Igorsoares62 talks about the Vegas plan not leading to repeg or large burn. He supports the initiative but wants to keep feet on the ground. The first part is negative ("will not lead"), but then he says he supports it. So mixed, but overall neutral because he's cautious but not entirely negative.

The next few unknown messages are promoting FlixTalk #175 with

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. Let me go through each message one by one.

Starting with the first message from wlkatja about the new partnership with Venice. They mention joining forces to deliver censorship-resistant AI agents onchain across 100 blockchains. The links provided are for reading and sharing. So the action items here might be to read the article and share the posts. 

Next, imanshabani1994 says "God bless you all" which seems like a positive sentiment but no action item. 

Doncho_MIOFF talks about Coinbase listing Terra Classic (LUNC) and links to a Twitter post. The action here is to read the full post, but maybe also consider advocating for the listing? Not sure if that's an explicit action.

Asa332 and others share links to Twitter posts. Those might be to spread the word or engage with the content, but not clear action items. 

SuperEra announces a campaign with $FLIX and a FlixTalk session. The next steps here are to join the space today in 30 minutes and spread the word. 

Igorsoares62 discusses the Vegas plan not leading to repeg and suggests keeping feet on the ground. Maybe the action is to focus on realistic solutions without guarantees. 

The unknown user mentions a guest for FlixTalk #175 and a space link. Action items here are to attend the FlixTalk session in 7 hours and spread the word. 

Another unknown user talks about Cosmos Voice #10 on June 28. The action is to participate in the video meeting on Telegram, set a reminder, and discuss topics like Layer Labs, WAVS, and AVS infra. 

rcjulin_ForkDAO's message is a greeting, no action. 

cryptobytes906 mentions Josh's feedback on the SDK50 proposal and contributions from Strath. So maybe next steps involve finalizing the SDK50 proposal with Strath's input. 

ISkitzTV asks if the SDK upgrade proposal will be posted on forums. The action here is to post the proposal on the forums. 

Nicolas_Boulay has several messages. He mentions the SDK50.13 upgrade proposal going live soon, fixing 47 bugs. So action item is to release the SDK50.13 proposal. Also
