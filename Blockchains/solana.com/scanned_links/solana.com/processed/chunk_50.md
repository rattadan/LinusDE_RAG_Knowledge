## Source Context
*From: https://solana.com/*

### Document Overview  
This content explains the structure of Solana transactions, focusing on message fields, instruction execution, atomicity, and transaction fees.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Message field**: Contains metadata like `header`, `accountKeys`, `recentBlockhash`, and `instructions`.  
- **Instructions**: Execute in order, referencing `accountKeys` and `programIds` for program invocation.  
- **Atomic transactions**: All instructions must succeed or fail entirely, ensuring consistency.  
- **Signatures**: Arrays of transaction signatures for account signers.  
- **Transaction size limit**: 1232 bytes, limiting the amount of data a transaction can include.  
- **Program invocation**: Instructions require program addresses, read/write account indices, and optional data.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Message structure**: `header` specifies read/write permissions and signer privileges.  
- **Instructions array**: Each instruction includes `accountKeys` (program and account indices) and `programIds` (for program execution).  
- **Signatures**: Generated by signing the transaction message with private keys for signers.  
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are "atomic" (all instructions succeed or fail) and execute sequentially.  
- **Transaction size limit**: Maximum 1232 bytes for transaction data (excluding header).  

### Related Topics  
- **Solana Account Model**: Described in the context of transaction execution and account addresses.  
- **Transaction Fees**: Covered in the section on transaction fees, emphasizing atomicity and size limits.  
- **Program Invocation**: Linked to the broader Solana ecosystem, where instructions interact with programs via `programIds`.

but includes the
same information.

When you fetch a transaction using its signature after sending it to the
network, you'll receive a response with the following structure.

Themessagefield contains the following fields:

header: Specifies read/write and signer privileges for addresses in theaccountKeysarray

accountKeys: Array of all account addresses used in the transaction's
instructions

recentBlockhash: Blockhash used to timestamp the transaction

instructions: Array of instructions to execute. EachaccountandprogramIdIndexin an instruction references theaccountKeysarray by
index.

signatures: Array including signatures for all accounts required as signers
by the instructions on the transaction. A signature is created by signing the
transaction message using the corresponding private key for an account.

Solana Account Model

Transaction Fees

- If a transaction includes multiple instructions, the instructions execute in
the order added to the transaction.
- Transactions are "atomic" - all instructions must process successfully, or the
entire transaction fails and no changes occur.
- Solana transactions include instructions that invoke programs on the network.
- Transactions areatomic- if any instruction fails, the entire transaction
fails and no changes occur.
- Instructions on a transaction execute in sequential order.
- The transaction size limit is1232bytes.
- Each instruction requires three pieces of information:The address of the program to invokeThe accounts the instruction reads from or writes toAny extra data required by the instruction (e.g., function arguments)
- The address of the program to invoke
- The accounts the instruction reads from or writes to
- Any extra data required by the instruction (e.g.
