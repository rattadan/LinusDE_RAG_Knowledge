### Document Overview  
This content explains technical analysis of cryptocurrency price charts, focusing on candlestick patterns, trade signals, and tools for visualizing price data on centralized and decentralized exchanges.  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Candlestick Charts**: Visual representation of price data with open, high, low, and close prices, highlighting trends and volatility.  
- **Color Codes**: Red/green candles indicate price trends (e.g., red =下跌, green =上涨).  
- **Wicks**: Lines showing the full price range of a candle, excluding the open and close.  
- **Price Ranges**: Traders identify key price levels (e.g., $21,500–$22,000) to enter/exit trades.  
- **CEXs vs. DEXs**: Centralized exchanges (e.g., dydx) provide real-time charts, while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offer alternative data visualization.  
- **Chart Tools**: Features like time settings, multiple angles, and historical data analysis to support trading decisions.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Example Candlestick**:  
  - Open: $21,500, Close: $22,000, High: $22,100, Low: $21,050.  
  - Red candle (price decline) implies the closing price is $21,500, with wicks showing the full range.  
- **Tools**:  
  - **dydx.xyz**: Offers real-time charts for all cryptocurrencies, with customizable time settings and chart types.  
  - **Third-party platforms**: Websites like CoinMarketCap or TradingView provide live crypto charts.  
- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Traders use chart patterns (e.g., bullish/bearish trends) and statistical metrics (e.g., volume, price action) to identify entry/exit points.  

### Related Topics  
- **Fundamental vs. Technical Analysis**: Contrast between evaluating crypto projects (fundamental) and using chart patterns (technical).  
- **Chart Tools**: Mention of dydx’s features (e.g., multiple time settings, chart types) aligns with broader documentation on trading platforms.  
- **Third-Party Platforms**: Connections to other documentation sections discussing cryptocurrency data visualization and tools.

technical analysis dedicated to studying chart data. Unlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis relies on chart patterns, statistics, and trendlines to predict future prices and set up trades. While a fundamental crypto analyst researches a coinâs history, network activity, and circulating supply, technical analysts use charting tools to pinpoint the best prices to enter and exit a trade. Traders using technical analysis need detailed chart data to develop their trading thesis and choose the prices theyâre most comfortable with when buying or selling an asset.

Seeing a candlestick crypto chart for the first time is overwhelming. However, every trader needs to recognize the following features to understand what theyâre looking at:

To understand candlestick charts, hereâs an example. Suppose a trader looks at a candlestick on a daily Bitcoin chart with the following features:

Here, BTC opened at $21,500 and closed at $22,000 within a 24-hour window. Although BTCâs price traded as low as $21,050 and as high as $22,100, the trading activityâs bulk happened between $21,500 and $22,000.

Now, letâs suppose the above candlestick was red rather than green. In this scenario, $22,000 would be the tradeâs opening price, and $21,500 would be closing. In other words, Bitcoin fell in price by $500 by the end of 24 hours. The wicks still represent BTCâs trading range in this session but not its opening or closing price.

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide real-time price charts for all cryptocurrencies on their platforms. For example, traders ondYdXcan choose any available crypto asset to view past and present price patterns. The company also has dozens of tools and different time settings to help traders visualize price data from multiple angles.

Besides crypto exchanges, a wealth of third-party websites offer live cryptocurrency charts.
