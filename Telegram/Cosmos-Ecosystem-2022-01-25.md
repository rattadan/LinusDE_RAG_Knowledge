## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions from the provided text. First, I need to parse through the text to identify the important elements.

Looking at the text, there are several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account. The first one on January 25th at 19:12 is just an emoji, which might not be significant. Then, at 17:45, they retweeted something about $RAW, comparing it to Osmo and mentioning that more information is coming soon. Another tweet at 17:06 is a positive reaction to a list, and at 17:04, they retweeted a thread about people missing opportunities on BTC and ENS.

The other entries are from user_7164487109, who seems to be posting job offers in Turkish. They mention part-time online work, daily salary of 500TL, and contact requests. The same message repeats at different times: 16:32, 15:22, 14:12. The user might be trying to get a job or recruit others, asking for contact and specifying that only interested people should reach out.

Now, the key points here are the Cosmos Ecosystem tweets about $RAW and their retweets, which indicate announcements or updates. The user's repeated job offers are another key element. The decisions might involve the Cosmos team preparing to release more info on $RAW, and the user actively seeking part-time workers or collaborators online.

I need to make sure the summary captures both the Cosmos-related content and the job postings. Since the user's messages are repetitive, I can consolidate them into one point mentioning the time range and the details. Avoid including the emojis and permalinks unless necessary, but focus on the content. Also, note the RTs and mentions as part of the key points. The summary should be brief but include all main ideas without getting bogged down in the repetitive nature of the job ads.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided several tweets and messages, and I need to determine the sentiment of each. Let me start by understanding each piece of text.

First, there's a tweet from Cosmos Ecosystem with just an eye emoji üëÄ. Emojis can be tricky. The eye might indicate observation or curiosity. Since it's standalone, without context, it's probably neutral. They're just pointing attention to something, not showing clear positive or negative emotion.

Next, another Cosmos tweet is a retweet about $RAW information coming soon, similar to Osmo. The words "Very similar" and "considerable" might be neutral, but the context of announcing new info could be positive, especially if the community is excited. However, since it's a factual retweet, maybe neutral. The user might be sharing news without expressing emotion.

Then there's a user's message in Turkish. They mention wanting part-time online work, earning 500TL daily, and ask others not to disturb. The emojis are a bit mixed: üùá and üòì. The text seems to be a job inquiry. The sentiment here is probably neutral as well, just stating a request without strong positive or negative words.

Another Cosmos tweet says "Very good listüòé‚öõÔ∏è" with a link. The emojis here are positive (üòé) and a atom symbol (‚öõÔ∏è), which might be neutral but the "Very good" is clearly positive. So this one is positive.

The next tweet is a retweet about people saying it's too late for BTC at 69k and ENS launched. The original tweet is from Cosmos themselves. The sentiment here could be positive if they're highlighting success stories, but the content mentions others' achievements. It might be neutral, just sharing information without clear emotion.

The user's subsequent messages are similar: part-time online work, daily salary of 500TL, wanting to earn money. All in Turkish, using different emojis but the message is consistent. Again, these are job requests, so neutral. The emojis might not add strong sentiment here.

Putting it all together, the Cosmos tweets are mostly neutral except for the one with "Very good list" which is positive. The user's messages are neutral requests. I need to check if there's any sarcasm or hidden context, but without more info, sticking to the obvious. So final sentiments would be a mix of positive and

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to extract action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The text includes several tweets and some user messages. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first one is a retweet mentioning that more information on $RAW is coming soon, similar to Osmo. The user might be looking for upcoming announcements or releases related to $RAW. So maybe that's a next step for the Cosmos team to release more details.

Another tweet says "Very good listüòé‚öõÔ∏è" with a link. That seems like a positive acknowledgment of a list someone shared. Not sure if there's an action item here unless the list itself is a decision or next step. But since it's just a retweet, maybe not.

Then there's a retweet about people missing opportunities because they think it's too late. The original tweet talks about how people wait too long and miss out. The Cosmos Ecosystem retweeted it. Not sure if that's an action item or just sharing a perspective.

Now, looking at the user_7164487109 messages. They're in Turkish. The first one mentions part-time online hiring, wanting to work part-time on the network, earn money, and asks others not to disturb. Then another message says hello, their company is hiring part-time online, offering 500TL daily salary, just need to spend some time online daily. Another one says "Online work, daily salary: 500TL, I want to earn money." And another similar one.

So these user messages are job postings or job offers. The user is trying to hire people for part-time online work, offering a daily wage. The action items here would be the company's need to hire part-time workers, the decision to offer 500TL daily, and the next step is for interested people to contact them.

Putting it all together, the Cosmos tweets don't have clear action items except maybe the $RAW announcement. The user's messages have the job offer details. So the main points are:

1. Cosmos Ecosystem plans to release more info on $RAW, similar to Osmo.
2. The user's company is hiring part-time online workers, offering 500TL daily, and wants applicants to contact them.

I should make sure not to miss any other possible decisions or steps. The
