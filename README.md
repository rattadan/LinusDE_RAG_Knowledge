# nRide: Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Ride-Hailing Protocol

## Overview
nRide is a community-owned, decentralized ride-hailing protocol designed to create a more open, equitable, and transparent ecosystem for drivers and riders. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, nRide eliminates intermediaries, reduces fees, and empowers users to interact directly.

- **Whitepaper:** See `nRide_Whitepaper/`

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Platform:** No central authority; all transactions are managed by smart contracts.
- **Open Source:** Protocol and libraries are open for community contribution and inspection.
- **Driver Registry:** Decentralized and verifiable database of drivers, ensuring trust and transparency.
- **Escrow Mechanism:** NRIDE token-powered escrow protects both riders and drivers from late cancellations and no-shows.
- **DAO Governance:** Token holders participate in decision-making and protocol evolution.

## Technology
- **Smart Contracts:** Implemented in CosmWasm and deployed on the JUNO blockchain.
- **Mobile App:** Flutter-based, available in private beta for Android and iOS.
- **Token:** $NRIDE (CW20 standard) — utility and governance token.

## Project Status
- First whitepaper written in early 2022
- Codebase under active development
- Private beta app live on app stores
- Smart contracts deployed on-chain and governed by the DAO

## Roadmap
- **Short-term:** Expand user base, refine escrow/registry, improve UX
- **Medium-term:** Open-source codebase, launch public beta, form partnerships
- **Long-term:** Become the leading global peer-to-peer ride-hailing platform

## Get Involved
- **Developers:** Contribute to open-source libraries and protocol
- **Drivers/Riders:** Join the platform and help shape the future of ride-hailing
- **Community:** Participate in hackathons, summits, and DAO governance
