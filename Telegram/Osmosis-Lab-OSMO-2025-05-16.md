## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to summarize this text. First, I need to go through each message and pick out the key points.

Starting with the first one, osmosis_statbot mentions visiting the official support site if help is needed. That's important because it's directing users to a support resource. Then jasbanza says you can check TV now and also dexscreener. I think "TV" here might be a typo or shorthand. Maybe they meant TradingView? Dexscreener is a known tool for tracking DEX data, so that's a key point about where to check charts.

Forthex's message is "figma balls." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Figma is a design tool, and "balls" could be slang or a typo. Maybe they meant "Figma's UI" or something else? Not sure, but since it's not clear, I might note it as a possible unrelated comment.

BrunoRDias asks where to check charts for Osmosis chain, mentioning they're new. They also reference Dextools, which is a platform similar to Dexscreener. So the key here is the user's request for chart resources on Osmosis and the mention of Dextools.

SergeyKh61 shares a link from The Block about a GameFi project called Bombie. The key point is the article link discussing a new concept in GameFi. Osmosis_news shares a Twitter link, which is likely about Osmosis-related updates or announcements. The user might need to check Twitter for the latest news.

Then there's kychuli saying BTC deposits can take 4-6 hours. Star_Man_Bright is asking about a BTC deposit delay, showing it's been 90 minutes and not showing up despite 10 confirmations. The key points here are the deposit delay and the number of confirmations.

Putting this all together, the main topics are support resources, chart tracking tools (Dexscreener, Dextools), the Bombie article, Osmosis Twitter updates, and BTC deposit processing time. The decisions or actions would be directing users to support, suggesting platforms for charts, and noting the deposit time.

I should make sure the summary is concise, so maybe group the chart tools together, mention the deposit issue with the time frame, and note the shared links. Also, the Figma comment might be irrelevant

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the main topics from this text. So, first, I need to look through each message and see what they're talking about.

The first message is from osmosis_statbot, telling people to visit the support site if they need help. That seems like support or customer service related. Then jasbanza mentions checking on TV and dexscreener. TV might be a typo for "now" or maybe a platform? Dexscreener is a tool for checking cryptocurrency data, so maybe topics here are about checking crypto stats or platforms.

Forthex says "figma balls." Figma is a design tool, and "balls" could be slang or a typo. Maybe they're talking about a Figma project or something related to design. BrunoRDias asks about charts from Osmosis chain and mentions dextools. Osmosis is a blockchain, and dextools is another crypto analytics platform. So here, the topic is checking blockchain charts or analytics tools.

SergeyKh61 shares a link to The Block article about Bombie and GameFi. GameFi is gaming and finance, so that's a topic. The link might be about a new concept in that space. osmosis_news shares a Twitter link, which could be related to Osmosis updates or news.

kychuli and Star_Man_Bright are discussing BTC deposits taking time, confirmations on the explorer, and portfolio issues. So topics here are cryptocurrency transaction delays, Bitcoin confirmations, and wallet/portfolio tracking problems.

Putting it all together, the main topics would be support resources, crypto analytics platforms (like Dexscreener, Dextools), Figma design, GameFi developments (specifically Bombie), Osmosis blockchain charts, and BTC transaction delays with confirmations. Let me check if there's anything else. The Twitter link from osmosis_news might be about Osmosis updates, so maybe Osmosis news as a separate topic. The mention of TV by jasbanza could be a typo for "now" or maybe a TV-related platform, but since they also mention dexscreener, it's more about checking crypto data. So the list should include each distinct subject mentioned across the messages.

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. So, the user provided a bunch of chat messages and wants each analyzed for sentiment. Let me start by looking at each one individually.

First message: osmosis_statbot directing users to the support site. That's straightforward. It's a helpful message, so probably neutral. No positive or negative words here, just a link.

Next, jasbanza says you can check on TV or dexscreener. Again, seems like helpful info. Neutral, maybe positive since they're offering assistance. But the words themselves are neutral.

Forthex writes "figma balls." Hmm, "balls" in slang can be negative, but "figma" might be a typo or a term I don't know. Maybe they meant "Figma" the design tool? If it's a swear, like "balls," then negative. But without context, it's tricky. Could be frustration, so maybe negative.

BrunoRDias asks where to check charts for Osmosis chain and mentions being new. The sentiment here is neutral, just a question. But the fact that they're new might not affect sentiment unless they show frustration, which they don't.

Another BrunoRDias message: "Ty for answering" ‚Äì that's positive, gratitude expressed. The rest is a question about charts, so neutral. Overall, this one is positive because of the thanks.

SergeyKh61 shares a link to an article. The sentiment here is neutral unless the article's content is known, but the message itself is just a link. So neutral.

osmosis_news shares a Twitter link. Again, neutral as it's a news link without commentary.

kychuli says deposits can take longer, 4-6 hours. The user might be worried, but the message is informative. The mention of time being longer could be slightly negative, but it's a factual statement, so maybe neutral.

Star_Man_Bright asks about BTC deposit time, shows 10 confirmations. They're concerned but the message is a question seeking info. No explicit negative words, but the situation might be frustrating. However, the text itself is neutral.

So, most messages are neutral except BrunoRDias's second one (positive) and Forthex's which might be negative. Need to be careful with "figma balls" ‚Äì maybe a typo for "Figma" plus "balls" as in testicles? Or

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. First, I need to read through each message carefully and see if there's anything that someone needs to do, a decision that was made, or a next step that's mentioned.

Starting with the first message from osmosis_statbot at 14:03:01. It says, "If you need help, visit our official support site, https://support.osmosis.zone". That seems like an action item for users to visit the support site if they need help. So maybe that's one action item.

Next, jasbanza at 13:53:16 mentions, "You can check on TV now apparently but also dexscreener". The user is suggesting checking on TradingView (TV) and dexscreener for charts. This might be a next step for someone looking to view charts on Osmosis chain. So maybe BrunoRDias's question about where to check charts leads to this response, which is a next step.

Forthex at 13:52:16 says, "figma balls." That's a bit unclear. "Figma" could refer to the design tool, and "balls" might be slang or a typo. Maybe they're referring to a Figma file related to Osmosis? But without more context, it's hard to tell. I might need to note this as an unclear item or possibly ignore it if it's not actionable.

BrunoRDias at 13:35:08: "Like dextools I mean". So they're clarifying that they meant dextools, which is a tool for checking crypto charts. Then their previous message at 13:34:56 was asking where they can check charts from Osmosis chain. The response from jasbanza suggests using dexscreener and TradingView. So the action item here is BrunoRDias needs to use those platforms to check the charts.

SergeyKh61 at 13:30:48 shares a link to an article. Not sure if there's an action item here unless someone needs to read it, but it's just a shared link. Maybe the user is informing others about the article, but unless there's a specific instruction, this might not be an action item.
