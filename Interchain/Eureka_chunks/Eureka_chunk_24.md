## Eureka - Chunk 24

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

Support Requirements
Swap Venue Requirements
This document covers what Skip Go API requires of DEXes to support them as potential swapping venues within the API’s cross-chain DEX aggregation functionality. At the end, the document provides instructions for helping the Skip team add your DEX to the API as a swapping venue

​
Background
DEXes often want Skip Go API to add support for their DEX as a swapping venue because the API powers cross-chain swaps + transfers in all the major cosmos wallets (Leap, Keplr, IBC Wallet, Metamask Snap) and cross-chain DEX aggregation to many popular defi aggregator and dapp frontends (e.g. Stargaze). As a result, being added to the Skip Go API instantly offers distribution across the interchain for your DEX
The Skip Go API’s swapping system is currently built in CosmWasm and can support swapping assets on Cosmos SDK modules (ex: Osmosis Poolmanager) and other CosmWasm contracts (ex: Astroport DEX) that can be queried and executed by Skip Go API’s CosmWasm contracts.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is providing a technical overview of the requirements for adding a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) to the Skip Go API, specifically in terms of swap venue support.

**Technical Details:**

1. The document requires DEXes to have robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in place to handle potential delays or failures during cross-chain asset transfers.
2. The Swap Venue Requirements section mentions that the DEX must be able to handle various Cosmos SDK modules (e.g., Osmosis Poolmanager, Astroport DEX) as queryable CosmWasm contracts.
3. The document also highlights the importance of implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

**Context Connection and Building upon Surrounding Context:**

1. This section is connected to the surrounding context by mentioning that DEXes want Skip Go API to add support for their DEX as a swapping venue, which implies that the API's cross-chain DEX aggregation functionality is crucial for providing seamless trading experiences.
2. The document references the existing Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), Axelar GMP, Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP), and Hyperlane protocols, indicating that the Skip Go API requires robust interchain communication capabilities to support various asset transfers.

**Specific Requirements and Conditions:**

1. Users must be prepared for potential delays or failures during cross-chain asset transfers, which suggests that the DEXes need to be aware of the risks associated with these transactions.
2. The document recommends providing user education on potential failure points, risk management best practices, and developer best practices for building robust error handling mechanisms.

**Additional Insights:**

1. The section provides additional insights into medium-term and long-term solutions to improve cross-chain asset transfer success rates, including implementing packet tracking and live relayer/client status in the API.
2. Recommendations are provided to support users, developers, and risk management efforts by emphasizing the importance of robust error handling, fallback mechanisms, and developer best practices.

The current text chunk is providing a detailed technical overview of the requirements for adding DEXes to the Skip Go API, with specific focus on swap venue support, interchain communication protocols, user education, and recommended solutions.
