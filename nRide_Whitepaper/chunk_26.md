2.2.8. TerminationAck
When a ride request is terminated by either the passenger or the driver, the other party can respond with a
"TerminationAck" message that includes a secret phrase. This phrase allows the counterparty to unlock
their part of the escrow account and receive their deposit, as well as any applicable cancellation fees. By responding with a TerminationAck message that includes a secret phrase, the user helps to ensure that
the refund process is secure and that the other party can redeem their deposit from the escrow account. Overall, this process helps to create a more transparent and reliable ride sharing experience for both passengers and drivers, by providing a mechanism for canceling ride requests and receiving refunds if necessary.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It looks like you're discussing two different data structures or classes in your ride-sharing platform:

1. `Termination` object with properties:
   - `id`: Unique identifier for the termination request.
   - `source`: The source of the termination request (e.g., passenger or driver).
   - `confirmationID`: A unique confirmation ID associated with the original ride request.
   - `reason`: The reason for terminating the ride, either "Completed" or "Cancelled".
   - `secret`: An additional secret phrase to unlock the escrow account and receive a refund.

2. `TerminationAck` object:
   - This is an acknowledgement message sent by one party to another when a termination request is received.
   - It contains a secret phrase that helps both parties resolve the issue, ensuring transparency and reliability in the ride-sharing experience.
   - When acknowledged, this message allows the counterparty (either the passenger or driver) to unlock their escrow account and receive their deposit, as well as any cancellation fees.

In essence, both objects play crucial roles in maintaining trust, security, and fairness within the platform. The `TerminationAck` message provides a way for parties to communicate securely and transparently about terminating ride requests, while the `Termination` object handles the actual transactional aspect of the process.
