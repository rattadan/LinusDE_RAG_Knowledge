Query Messages
Exposes a “Swap Exact In Simulation” method where a user can put the inputs that would be used in the “Swap Exact In” execution method, and gets a response from the query that specifies the asset they would receive if executing the method (see Osmosis for a module example, or Astroport for a contract example). Exposes a “Swap Exact Out Simulation” method where a user can input the asset desired and a given pool / path, and the query returns the asset required to swap in to receive the output asset desired (see Osmosis for a module example, or Astroport for a contract example). ​
Getting Skip to add support for your DEX
If your DEX and the chain its deployed on meets all of the functionality requirements described above, please fill out this support request form and submit it to support@skip.build or TG:@bpiv400. The form will help us scope how much work is required on our side to add support, guide our implementation, and inform our decision for how quickly to prioritize it in our roadmap (e.g. based on swapping volume + liquidity, and clarity of the technical information)

CW20 Tokens & Their Limitations
Information about performing CW20 swaps

This page covers the basics of CW20s and the limitations around performing cross-chain actions with CW20 tokens — compared to tokenfactory and “native” Cosmos assets (aka Bank Module assets).

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I'll be happy to help you with your queries. However, I want to clarify that this conversation will be about providing information on adding support for a decentralized exchange (DEX) called Skip, specifically regarding their DEX functionality and limitations.

To answer your questions, I'll do my best to provide detailed responses while adhering to the guidelines you provided.

Since we are not discussing the technical implementation of Skip's DEX but rather its features and limitations, I will focus on providing information and answering your questions directly.

Please go ahead and ask your questions about the "Swap Exact In Simulation" and "Swap Exact Out Simulation" methods, or about the CW20 Tokens & Their Limitations. I'll do my best to provide accurate and helpful responses.
