**Original Text:**

From the algorithmic point of view, herein we have used quite simple
heuristics to face the increase in complexity induced by the need of optimizing the PUDO points. Although they were useful to reduce
the required time and results were already good, it is possible to design more specific heuristics (for instance, based on the tools that
already exist to solve TSP) that might yield even better results. Regarding the transport system itself, these shared systems still need
better understanding in a number of topics, like how to determine the optimal fleet of vehicles (which can be directly affected by
optimizing the PUDO points) or how does the demand respond to them. Finally, the relationship between SMoD and public transport is a crucial aspect to investigate for the future of these mobility
systems. On the one hand, the system we study here resembles public transport as some users need to walk, so comparing which of
them performs better is a relevant question.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This text chunk appears to be discussing the implementation of a ridesharing or mobility-on-demand (MoD) system, specifically focusing on rebalancing strategies.

**Technical Details:**

* The paper discusses using simple heuristics for optimizing PUDO points, which are likely related to routing and scheduling.
* More specific optimizations can be achieved by combining these heuristics with advanced mathematical frameworks, as shown in the references provided (Zhao et al., Stiglic et al., Tirachini & Gomez-Lobo).
* The transport system itself is modeled using simulation techniques, but the details are not explicitly stated.

**Contextual Connection:**

* This text chunk appears to be building upon a broader context of research on ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems, which includes key themes such as rebalancing strategies, modeling mathematical frameworks, optimization heuristics, simulation, service design, flexible transport services, ride-sharing with meeting points, vehicle rebalancing for MoD systems, and benefits of meeting points.
* The text also mentions a comparison between ridesharing systems and public transportation, suggesting that the study is part of a larger research agenda to understand how these two modes interact.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

* None explicitly stated in this chunk. However, the text assumes familiarity with the broader context of MoD system design and mathematical modeling.
* The study appears to require access to specific data or simulations for optimization heuristics, which may be limited by the scope of the reference list provided.
* There are no explicit constraints mentioned, but the authors' goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of current research trends in MoD systems.
