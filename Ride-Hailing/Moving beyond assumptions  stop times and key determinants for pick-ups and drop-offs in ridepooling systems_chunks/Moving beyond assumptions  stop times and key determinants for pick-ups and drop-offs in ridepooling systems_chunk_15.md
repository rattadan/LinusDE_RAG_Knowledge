**Original Text:**

The time scale included the vehicle’s behaviour
during deceleration and acceleration as well as the dwelling process of the passengers. As a
result, they found that the stop time significantly affects the service’s overall efficiency. Bilali
et al. (2019) conducted different simulation scenarios to quantify the influence of various
service quality factors, examining scenarios with 0, 30, and 60 s boarding times. Zwick and
Axhausen (2020b) also considered three distinct stop times in their ridepooling simulation
study: a shorter (15 s) and a longer duration (60 s) in addition to the base case of 30 s. After
simulating the different scenarios to analyze service efficiency, they found that a shorter
stop time resulted in an increased number of rides (8.0%) and higher mileage. In contrast,
a longer stop time reduced the number of transported passengers (−9.8%), leading to less
mileage than the base case. Lu et al. (2023) investigated a DRT service for schools in a rural area of Germany.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk is explaining how ride-pooling services can be simulated and analyzed using advanced tools, including simulation studies.

**Technical Details:**

1. Simulation studies: The chunk mentions that simulation tools like MATSim are used to model ride-pooling strategies and their operational aspects.
2. MATSim: This is a transportation modeling software that allows for the simulation of various transportation modes, including ride-hailing services.

**Context Connection:**

The current text chunk builds upon the surrounding context by discussing specific research papers and studies related to ride-pooling services, urban transport systems, and sustainability. The references provided in the document list various papers that investigate the operational aspects, sustainability impacts, and simulation studies of ride-pooling services.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no explicit requirements or conditions mentioned in this text chunk. However, it is likely that researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals interested in understanding and improving shared mobility solutions in urban contexts will be interested in the simulations conducted by Bilali et al. (2019), Zwick and Axhausen (2020b), Lu et al. (2023), and other references listed in the document.

In terms of practical constraints, the simulation studies mentioned in this chunk may require:

* Access to advanced transportation modeling software like MATSim
* Data on ride-hailing service operations, passenger travel times, and road traffic congestion
* Availability of real-time data on urban demographics, socioeconomic factors, and environmental conditions

These constraints would need to be addressed before conducting simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of different ride-pooling services in urban contexts.
