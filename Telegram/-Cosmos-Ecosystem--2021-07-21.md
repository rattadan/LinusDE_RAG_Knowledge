## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary focusing on key points and decisions. The text provided has multiple messages from different sources, mainly about Sputnik Network integrating with various cryptocurrencies and some announcements from the Cosmos Ecosystem.

First, I need to identify the main announcements. The Sputnik Network has connected with SifChain, allowing tips in $ROWAN. Then, they mention PersistenceOne integration for $XPRT, and Osmosis for $OSMO. Each integration allows users to tip on Twitter and use Telegram bots with no fees. Also, there's a mention of top-up via sputnik.exchange and tech support.

Other tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem include collaborations like e-Money and Polygon, Persistence & AscendEx's event with rewards, Kava needing votes, Akash Network's job search, Kava SWAP Testnet, IBC going live for Sifchain, and various network upgrades or events.

I should group the Sputnik integrations together, noting each token and the platforms (Twitter, Telegram). Then list the other Cosmos Ecosystem updates separately. Highlight key features like no fees, direct tipping, and the need to top up balances. Also, mention the important events like the IBC launch and Kava's testnet.

Need to make sure it's concise, so bullet points might be best. Avoid repeating the same structure for each token. Maybe start with Sputnik's expansions, then other ecosystem news. Check for any deadlines or specific actions required, like voting or participating in events. Also, note the links provided for support and top-ups.

Wait, there's a mention of multiple tokens: $ROWAN, $XPRT, $OSMO, $AKT, $DVPN. Each connection allows tipping on Twitter and Telegram with those tokens. The user should know they need to have the token in their balance, and how to top up.

Other points: No fees for transactions, tech support via Telegram, community focus. Then in the Cosmos Ecosystem, there's events like Kava SWAP Testnet with prize pools, job openings at Akash, network upgrades, and calls for votes.

I need to structure this so the key points are clear. Maybe separate into sections: Sputnik Network Integrations and Cosmos Ecosystem Updates. Under each, list the main actions and decisions. Use bold for important terms. Keep it brief but informative.

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to understand what the text is about. Looking through the messages, they all seem to be related to the Cosmos Ecosystem, with various projects and announcements.

Starting with the first message from "unknown" on 2021-07-21T21:58:43+00:00. It mentions SifChain and Sputnik Network connecting, allowing tips with $ROWAN on Twitter and Telegram. So the main topics here are SifChain, Sputnik Network, $ROWAN, Twitter tips, Telegram bot, and decentralization.

Then there are several tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. The first one talks about e-Money and Polygon partnering. So e-Money, Polygon. Another tweet mentions Persistence & AscendEx event with USDT rewards. PersistenceOne, AscendEx, 40K USDT rewards. Then Kava needing votes, so Kava. Another tweet about Akash Network hiring a Product Marketing Lead, so Akash Network. 

Another message states that $XPRT is implemented into Sputnik, so Sputnik Network again, $XPRT. Then Kava SWAP Testnet with a prize pool, so Kava_Swap. Then IBC going live next week for Sifchain, which is another topic. 

The next part from "unknown" on 2021-07-21T10:56:33+00:00 mentions PersistenceOne and Sputnik connected, allowing tips with $XPRT. So PersistenceOne, Sputnik Network, $XPRT. 

Other tweets include Regen Network's software upgrade, so Regen Network. Sifchain preparing for new trading pairs like ERC-20, $ETH, $ROWAN, etc., so Sifchain, trading pairs. Then Terra Money (now @terra_money), so Terra Money. Osmosis needing votes, so Osmosis. Akash needing votes, so Akashnet. 

Another message about Sputnik Network connecting with Osmosis for $OSMO tips, so Sputnik Network, Osmosis, $OSMO. Also, mentions of ETHCC event for Cosmos. 

I need to list all these topics without repetition. Let me

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis. The user provided a bunch of text messages from different users, mostly about Sputnik Network and various Cosmos Ecosystem projects. The task is to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll look at each message individually. The first one from "unknown" is announcing that SifChain and Sputnik are connected, allowing tips with $ROWAN. It uses emojis like üì°üõ∞ and words like "connected", "send tips", "no fees", "tech support", "from community for community". These all sound positive, promoting new features and community benefits. The exclamation marks add to the enthusiasm.

Then there are several tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. They mention partnerships like e-Money and Polygon, events with rewards (Persistence & AscendEx), calls to vote for Kava, job openings at Akash Network, and updates about Sputnik integrating more tokens like $XPRT, $OSMO, etc. These tweets seem to be sharing news and updates, which are neutral in tone but might lean positive because they highlight growth and collaboration. However, some might be neutral since they're factual announcements without overt positive language.

Another "unknown" message talks about PersistenceOne and Sputnik connecting, allowing tips with $XPRT. Again, similar structure to the first message: emojis, instructions, benefits like no fees. Positive again here.

Another "unknown" message about Osmosis and Sputnik integration for $OSMO. Same pattern: emojis, new features, benefits. Definitely positive.

The other tweets mention network upgrades, trading pairs, educational content, and voting. These are informative but not clearly positive or negative. For example, "Kava needs your vote" is a call to action without emotional language. "Getting ready for ERC-20..." is a statement of progress, which could be seen as positive, but maybe neutral since it's just an update.

Putting it all together, the majority of the messages, especially the ones from "unknown", are promoting new features and benefits of Sputnik Network with enthusiastic language. The Cosmos Ecosystem tweets are more neutral, sharing news and events. However, the repeated positive announcements from Sputnik might tip the overall sentiment towards positive. The user might be trying to spread the word about Sputnik's integrations, which are framed as community-driven and beneficial. The neutral parts are the factual

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to extract the action items, decisions, or next steps from this text. The user provided a bunch of chat messages, mostly from "combot" and "unknown" sources. The main content seems to be about Sputnik Network integrating with various cryptocurrencies like $ROWAN, $XPRT, $OSMO, etc., allowing users to send tips on Twitter and Telegram.

First, I need to identify each message's key points. For example, the first message from unknown at 2021-07-21T21:58:43+00:00 talks about SifChain and Sputnik Network connecting. The action items here might be that users can now send tips with $ROWAN on Twitter by mentioning @username and the amount, and they need to top-up via sputnik.exchange. Also, Telegram integration with commands like /help.

Then there are several combot messages. Each of them seems to be tweets from Cosmos Ecosystem. For instance, the tweet about e-Money and Polygon being friends. Not sure if that's an action item or just an announcement. Similarly, Persistence & AscendEx event with rewards, Kava needing votes, Akash Network hiring a Product Marketing Lead, etc. These might be next steps for the community members to participate in events, vote, check job openings, etc.

Another unknown message at 2021-07-21T02:04:11+00:00 mentions Osmosis and Sputnik Network connecting, so similar action items as the first one but with $OSMO.

I need to go through each message and pick out what requires action. Action items usually involve doing something like sending tips, visiting a site, using a command. Decisions might be partnerships or integrations that have been made. Next steps could be events upcoming, voting, job applications.

Wait, the user wants any action items, decisions, or next steps. So decisions here might be the integrations that have already been done (e.g., SifChain connected), which are decisions made. Action items and next steps are things the community should do, like vote, participate in events, use the new features, top-up balances, spread the information.

Also, some messages mention visiting sputnik.exchange to top-up, using Telegram bots with /help, spreading information for
