**LLM Contextual Output:**

The provided text chunk is:

"Moving beyond assumptions: stop times and key determinants for pickups and drop-offs in ridepooling systems"

Here's a focused analysis of what this specific section is explaining, its connections to the surrounding context, and any specific requirements or constraints mentioned:

**Exact technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk:**

* The concept of stop times (the time spent at each pickup and drop-off point) and their impact on ridepooling systems.
* Key determinants for pickups and drop-offs in ridepooling systems, which are likely to be related to factors such as traffic congestion, parking availability, and transportation modes.

**How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:**

* The text builds upon the previous section by introducing new technical terms (stop times) and concepts (key determinants), expanding the scope of research in ridepooling systems.
* It also references specific studies and papers that have been cited in the surrounding context, indicating a shared focus on understanding operational aspects of ridepooling.

**Any specific requirements or conditions mentioned:**

* The text mentions that the study focuses on "pickup and drop-off times" as key determinants for ridepooling systems, suggesting that this aspect will be explored in more detail.
* It also notes that the research aims to "move beyond assumptions," implying that there may be gaps in current knowledge or approaches that need to be addressed.

In terms of requirements or constraints, the text suggests that:

* The study aims to provide new insights into operational aspects of ridepooling systems, which could inform the design and implementation of more efficient and effective shared mobility solutions.
* The research focuses on a specific aspect of ridepooling (pick-ups and drop-offs), suggesting that the study may be building upon existing research in other areas of the field.
