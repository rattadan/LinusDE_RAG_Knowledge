The ride-hailing problem can be considered part of the domain of
dynamic vehicle routing problems. In this domain, it can be seen as a
special case of the dynamic dial-a-ride problem. The main difference is

in the same way as the demand is distributed. A solution is obtained
by solving a corresponding matching problem. De Souza et al. (2020)
and Wallar et al. (2018) use a similar idea but prevent further vehicles
from repositioning when the expected demand is already met. In this
way, they can reduce repositioning costs. In Jiao et al. (2021), reinforcement learning is applied for repositioning, maximizing the income
per hour. Braverman et al. (2019), as well as (Zhang and Pavone, 2016),
investigate the repositioning problem from a queueing-theoretical perspective.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is providing detailed technical analysis of dynamic dispatch and real-time management in ride-hailing systems.

1. The exact technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk are:

* Dynamic dispatch: This refers to the process of assigning routes for vehicles to pick up passengers in real-time based on demand.
* Real-time management: This involves managing and optimizing the dynamic dispatch process to minimize costs, reduce wait times, and improve passenger experience.
* Spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network (GMCNN): This is a type of deep learning model used for demand forecasting. It applies graph convolutional neural networks to spatial data to predict demand.
* Reinforcement learning: This is an algorithm used to optimize the dynamic dispatch process by maximizing revenue per hour.

2. How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:

This section provides technical details and background information on the dynamic dispatch and real-time management of ride-hailing systems, building upon the previous sections that discussed simulation and modeling, dynamic dispatch and repositioning, and rebalancing strategies. By providing a detailed explanation of these concepts, this section aims to inform and explain the solution being presented in Section 7.

3. Any specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:

* The demand is distributed throughout the ride-hailing system.
* A solution is obtained by solving a corresponding matching problem.
* De Souza et al. (2020) and Wallar et al. (2018) use a similar idea to prevent further vehicles from repositioning when the expected demand is already met.
