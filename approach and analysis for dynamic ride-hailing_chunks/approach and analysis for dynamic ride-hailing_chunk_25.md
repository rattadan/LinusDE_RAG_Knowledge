**Original Text:**

To enable the use of any of these as well as combinations of
these, we formulate the reward function as follows:

‚Ä¢ Setup: The vehicle is vacant and on its way to pick up a customer. ‚Ä¢ Processing: The vehicle travels with a customer on board from the
pickup to the drop-off location. ‚Ä¢ Repositioning: The vehicle is vacant and on its way to a designated
parking lot for idling. ‚Ä¢ Idling: The vehicle is vacant and stationary in a parking lot,
waiting for a new job. ‚Ä¢ Null: The vehicle just dropped off a customer at the drop-off
location and is waiting for either a new job or a parking lot
assignment for idling. ùëÖùëÜùëÖ calculates the reward related to the number of served requests. Here, only integer numbers are possible, indicating the number of feasible assignments of vehicles to pending requests, since these requests
will be served. ùëÖùëä ùëá computes the reward related to the waiting time
of the customers.

**Technical Details and Parameters**

1. **Reward Function Components:**
   - The reward function consists of two components:
     1. `R_S`: Number of served requests, which is an integer representing the number of feasible assignments of vehicles to pending requests.
     2. `R_W`: Waiting time of customers, which is a non-negative real-valued quantity indicating the waiting time for each customer.

**Context and Connections**

This chunk provides specific details about how the reward function is formulated and what it represents in the context of ride-hailing systems. The reward function is designed to measure two aspects:

1. **Served Requests (R_S):**
   - This component evaluates the efficiency of assigning vehicles to pending requests, indicating that each request can be served effectively with one feasible assignment.
2. **Waiting Time of Customers (R_W):**
   - This component measures the time customers spend waiting for a new job or assignment, which is an important aspect of ride-hailing systems.

The reward function's design suggests that optimizing `R_S` and minimizing `R_W` are crucial goals in designing efficient ride-hailing systems. By maximizing `R_S`, ride-hailing companies can reduce their costs associated with vehicle utilization and waiting times for customers.

**Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints**

None explicitly mentioned in this chunk. However, considering the context of ride-hailing systems, it is essential to ensure that the reward function's components align with industry requirements and constraints:

1. **Integer feasibility:** The `R_S` component implies integer values for feasible assignments.
2. **Non-negative waiting time:** The `R_W` component ensures that the waiting time of customers is non-negative.

These constraints are fundamental to designing effective ride-hailing systems and optimizing their performance.
