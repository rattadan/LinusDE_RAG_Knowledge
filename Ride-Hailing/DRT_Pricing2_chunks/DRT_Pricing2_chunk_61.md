## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 61

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

We use the previously introduced
calculations in two different situations:

The aim of this computational study is to analyze and compare
the quality of the presented strategies and design decisions depending
on varying problem characteristics. First, we describe in Section 6.1
the instances and configurations used in the study. Then, we perform
the analysis of the assignment strategies in Section 6.2 and of the
repositioning strategies in Section 6.3. 6.1. Instances and configuration
For the instance generation and the execution of the implemented
strategies, we use the pyhailing framework (Kullman, 2021) with custom
modifications to allow different problem settings. The general setting
is close to the one used in Kullman et al. (2021). The considered
service area is the district of Manhattan in New York City. Therefore,
we use Manhattan distances instead of Euclidean distances.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

The current text chunk focuses on:

**Technical Details and Parameters:**

* Pyhailing framework (Kullman, 2021) with custom modifications for different problem settings.
* Manhattan distances used as the service area instead of Euclidean distances.

These are the specific technical details and parameters mentioned in this chunk. 

**Connections to or Building upon the Surrounding Context:**

This chunk builds upon the context provided by the previous reference text, which discussed various aspects of ride-hailing systems such as dynamic trip-vehicle assignment, spatio-temporal demand forecasting, optimization-based strategies, empty-car routing, and multi-taxi dispatch algorithms. The current study appears to be an extension or continuation of these existing efforts.

Specifically, this chunk connects by referencing key terms from the surrounding context, including:

* Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment
* Spatio-temporal demand forecasting
* Optimization-based strategies
* Empty-car routing
* Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms

These references suggest that the current study is an ongoing effort to build upon and improve existing research in these areas.

**Specific Requirements, Conditions, or Constraints:**

There are no specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk. The context implies a general purpose study with the goal of comparing and analyzing different strategies for optimizing ride-hailing systems under varying problem characteristics.
