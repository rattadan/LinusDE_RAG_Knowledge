## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to summarize this text concisely, focusing on key points and decisions. The user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people, mostly about Osmosis and some tokens like FET, RIO, NINJA, USDC, USDT. 

First, I should go through each message and pick out the important information. The latest messages are at the bottom, but the user might want the summary in chronological order. Wait, the timestamps start from 2025-01-21T06:52:31 up to 21:29:02. So the most recent messages are at the top. But the summary should probably be in order of the key points, not necessarily time.

Looking at the messages, the main topics seem to be:

1. Limit orders on Osmosis: There's a bug related to token exponents (6 vs 18), so limit orders for FET (which has 18 exponents) can't be set below $1. The team doesn't plan to fix this soon. Also, RIO and NINJA can't have limit orders because their liquidity pools don't meet the requirements. Davidjgoosey provided a link to docs.

2. Swap fees confusion: Sirwenalot is asking why the frontend shows 0.1% fees on a 0.2% pool, and mikebarb explains it's due to spread factors acting as swap fees, with 2% charge and 1% going to stakers.

3. Babylon partnership: Users mention that Osmosis partnering with Babylon (layer2 for Bitcoin) is a big deal. There's a Twitter Space by Sunny from Babylon. Also, market psychology and token rankings are discussed, with $osmo moving up on CMC.

4. Other messages: Invitations to events, some casual comments, and a link shared by Khuwarzmi.

Decisions here would be about the technical issues with limit orders and the explanation of swap fees. The Babylon partnership seems important for future developments. Also, the token's ranking movement is noted.

I need to structure the summary to highlight these points clearly. Maybe start with the limit order issue, then swap fees, then Babylon partnership, and the token's performance. Omit the less relevant messages like event invitations or casual chats unless they're part of a decision. The key

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract the main topics from the provided text as a comma-separated list. First, I need to go through each message and identify the key themes or topics discussed.

Starting with the earliest messages. The first few messages from Khuwarzmi, user_1746142216, and jaleel0web3 are about someone named BD from Web3 Global Media inviting a team representative to an event and Twitter spaces. Then there's a mention of a link related to OsmosisInsights, which might be about a specific pool or update. The user_1746142216 also asks about the next "thirdening," which seems like a term related to Osmosis or cryptocurrency events.

Moving on to the messages from user_343756695, they discuss market psychology, OSMO's rank on CMC, and future expectations for $osmo. There's a mention of Babylon partnership and Sunny's statements about rankings. Mrtiahou talks about Osmosis becoming a layer2 of Bitcoin with Babylon, which is a significant technical topic.

Then there's a series of messages from davidjgoosey explaining limit orders on Osmosis. He mentions that limit orders are only possible with USDC or USDT due to exponent differences (6 vs 18), which causes issues with tokens like FET, RIO, and NINJA. The team's response about pool requirements for limit orders is another point. Also, there's a mention of a Twitter Space event with Sunny speaking.

Other messages include discussions about swap fees in concentrated liquidity pools, with mikebarb explaining spread factors and fees. There's also some casual conversation from WhoIsAbk and BasementNodes, but those might not be key topics.

So, compiling all these, the main topics would be:

- Limit orders on Osmosis (specifically for FET, RIO, NINJA)
- Token exponents (6 vs 18)
- Liquidity pool requirements for order books
- USDC and USDT as required tokens for limit orders
- Osmosis and Babylon partnership (layer2 integration)
- Market psychology and asset performance
- OSMO's ranking on CMC
- Sunny's statements about OSMO's future ranking
- Swap fees in concentrated liquidity pools
- Spread factors

*Frequently mentioned terms:*
- limit (10 mentions)
- orders (7 mentions)

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this text. So, the user provided a bunch of chat messages from different people discussing things related to Osmosis, a blockchain or DeFi platform maybe. They're talking about limit orders on tokens like FET, RIO, NINJA, and some technical issues with exponents. There's also mentions of Babylon partnership, Sunny speaking on Twitter Spaces, and some market psychology.

First, I need to break down each message and see if they're positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start from the top. 

The first message by davidjgoosey says "Of course!!" which sounds positive. Then he's explaining a bug with limit orders and exponents. The tone here is a bit negative because it's a bug, but he mentions it's minor and unfortunate, so maybe neutral? The user might be frustrated but the response is informative.

Next, SQUATCHTOSHI thanks the team for a detailed response. That's positive. Then davidjgoosey again explains why limit orders aren't available for RIO and Ninja. Neutral because it's just information, not expressing emotion. 

Another message from davidjgoosey talks about the technical differences causing issues with FET limit orders. He says it's a "weird quirk" that's unlikely to be fixed soon. That's a bit negative, but more like a factual statement with a slight negative connotation. 

SQUATCHTOSHI asks about limit orders on NINJA, which is a neutral question. Then davidjgoosey asks about enabling limit orders on $RIO, which is neutral. 

WhoIsAbk says "I already bought it so back off" ‚Äì not sure the context, but this sounds a bit negative or defensive. Maybe negative. 

keylessentry claims to be selling OSMO for BTC, which could be neutral or negative depending on intent. Maybe neutral since it's just a statement. 

davidjgoosey mentions Sunny speaking on Twitter Space, which is positive. 

User_343756695 talks about market psychology being bullish, which is positive. 

junjierr says being realistic but optimistic is important, which is positive. 

WhoIsAbk again says Osmo and Sunny made the bull, which is positive with emojis. 

mikebarb explains spread factors and fees, which seems

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided chat messages. So first, I need to read through all the text carefully and identify parts where someone is being asked to do something, a decision is made, or a next step is mentioned.

Starting from the top, the latest message is from davidjgoosey at 2025-01-21T21:29:02+00:00. He mentions that limit orders shouldn't have been enabled for FET due to exponent differences. Then there's a response from SQUATCHTOSHI thanking the team, and another message from davidjgoosey explaining about RIO and NINJA not meeting the requirements for limit orders. 

Earlier, davidjgoosey had asked @jeremyparish and @JohnnyWyles87 a question about enabling limit orders on $RIO. That seems like an action item directed at those two. Then there's a mention of a Twitter Space by Sunny, which might be a next step for others to join. 

Looking further down, there's a user asking about the next thirdening and the osmo's rank. But those might not be action items. Then Sirwenalot is confused about swap fees, and mikebarb explains it's due to spread factors and taker fees. The statbot points to a support site. 

Other messages are general comments or discussions without specific actions. So the main action items I see are:

1. davidjgoosey asking jeremyparish and JohnnyWyles87 about enabling limit orders on RIO.
2. The team needs to address the FET limit order issue caused by exponent differences.
3. The team should consider deploying the necessary liquidity pools for RIO and NINJA if they meet the requirements.
4. mikebarb checking something (maybe related to the swap fees question).
5. Inviting someone from the team to Web3 Global Media's event and Twitter spaces.

Wait, the user_343756695 and others mention Babylon partnership and rankings, but those are more informational. The key actionable items are the ones where someone is supposed to do something. Also, the message from jaleel0web3 inviting someone to their event is a next step that the team should respond to.
