## Chunk 53

**Original Text:**

Travel time and travel distance
Tab. 1 and 2 provide the average DRT travel time and average DRT trip distance for each simulation experiment. As
expected, increasing the minimum fee makes the DRT mode less attractive for short distance trips which is indicated
by an increase in average travel time and average travel distance. Also, expanding the DRT service area from the
inner-city area to the entire Berlin area allows for longer trips and yields an increase in average travel time and
average travel distance. For users switching from car to DRT, the average beeline travel speed is observed to decrease

**LLM Contextual Output:**

Based on the information provided in Table 1, it appears that as the minimum fee for using the DRT (Deutsche Reichstagsstrecken) service increases, the average travel time and distance also tend to increase.

In general, increasing the minimum fee makes the use of the DRT mode less attractive for short-distance trips. This is reflected in an increase in the average travel time and a corresponding increase in the average travel distance.
