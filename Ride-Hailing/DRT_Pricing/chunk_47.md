## Chunk 47

**Original Text:**

The DRT fare is set to a distance-based fare of 0.35 EUR/km, and the minimum fee is set to (a) 0.00,
(b) 2.00 or (c) 3.00 EUR. All simulation experiments are carried out for two pricing schemes for the car mode: i) no
tolling and ii) with a toll of 0.20 EUR/km. The toll is only imposed on car users and does not affect to DRT vehicles
or DRT users. The simulation results are compared to the base case continued in which there is no DRT mode and no
car toll. Ihab Kaddoura et al.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

To address this question, let's break down the information provided:

1. **DRT fare structure**: The fare is set to a distance-based fare of 0.35 EUR/km.
2. **Minimum fee options**:
   - (a) 0.00 EUR
   - (b) 2.00 EUR
   - (c) 3.00 EUR

These options imply different minimum fees for users, with the values representing increments in the fare structure.

Given that the question asks us to compare simulation results to a base case where there is no DRT mode and no car toll, we can infer that the base case likely involves using regular public transportation or other modes of transportation (not including DRT) without any additional fees. The absence of an explicit minimum fee in the base case suggests it's set to 0.00 EUR.

Now, comparing this to the options provided for the tolling scheme:

- Option (a): **0.00 EUR** is the same as the base case.
- Option (b) **2.00 EUR**: This would be equivalent to adding an additional 2 EUR to each fare structure unit in the base case.
- Option (c) **3.00 EUR**: This would add an additional 3 EUR to each fare structure unit in the base case.

Without specific details on how the DRT system is implemented or where it operates, we can't directly calculate exact changes from the base case for each option provided. However, given that tolling only affects car users and not DRT vehicles or their fares:

- If the DRT fare (0.35 EUR/km) plus a minimum fee of 2.00 EUR would result in a total of $0.47 per km for an additional fare structure unit compared to the base case (base case = 0.35 EUR), then:
  - Adding 2.00 EUR to this ($0.35 + $2.00 = $2.35) would make it $3.60 per km.
  - Adding another 1.50 EUR ($3.60 + $1.50 = $5.10) would bring the total fare structure unit change from base case to 4 units.

So, under these conditions and without additional information about how the DRT system operates (e.g., where it is located, its ridership, operating hours), we can conclude that the tolling scheme would increase fares by a significant amount compared to the base case for car users.
