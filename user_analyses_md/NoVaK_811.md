- Seems to value innovation and real-world applicability over short-term gains

Contextualizing the tweets:
The author is consistently promoting Kadena across these tweets, but not just with basic hype. Instead, they focus on specific aspects of Kadena that differentiate it in the blockchain space - its Proof-of-Work consensus, its approach to scalability, its enterprise-grade design, and its security features with Pact. They're positioning Kadena as a blockchain for those who understand the technology and see its potential as foundational infrastructure rather than speculative asset. The repetition of "Once you understand the tech" and comments on architecture vs. speculation suggest they're trying to appeal to more technically sophisticated crypto investors.

The account name "NoVaK_811" appears to be a play on "NoVAK" with the Kadena token symbol $KDA incorporated into the handle (NoVaK.811), suggesting a deliberate identification with the Kadena project.
