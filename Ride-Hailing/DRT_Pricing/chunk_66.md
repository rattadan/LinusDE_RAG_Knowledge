The effect of imposing a toll on car users. Implementing the DRT service and imposing a toll of 0.20 EUR/km on car
users yields a significant reduction in car usage and a more dominant mode shift effect from car to DRT. As shown

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears that you're analyzing the impact of introducing a toll on car users in different areas of Berlin, Germany, using data from the District Rapid Transit (DRT) system.

From the information provided, we can observe the following trends:

* In the Inner-city Berlin area, there is a significant reduction in DRT trips when no toll is imposed. The number of DRT trips decreases by 255,030.
* When a 0.00 EUR minimum fee is applied and no car toll is included, there are still relatively high numbers of DRT trips (502,040).
* With the introduction of a 0.20 EUR/km toll for car users, the number of DRT trips increases, but it's not as significant as in the previous scenario.
* The trend continues when a 2.00 EUR minimum fee is applied and no car toll is included, with a decrease of 28,680 DRT trips.

This suggests that imposing a toll on car users has a positive effect on reducing their usage and promoting the use of public transportation (DRT).

The key findings can be summarized as follows:

* Imposing a toll increases the number of DRT trips in areas without a previous choice for another mode.
* The increase in DRT trips is more significant when the toll rate decreases from 0.20 EUR/km to 2.00 EUR/km.
* The reduction in car usage and the shift towards public transportation are more pronounced with higher toll rates.

These findings support the idea that introducing a toll can be an effective way to reduce car usage and increase the use of public transportation, particularly in areas where car usage is high.
