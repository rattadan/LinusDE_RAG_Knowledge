### Document Overview  
This content outlines the role of validators in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems like Avalanche, including how to become a validator, key statistics, and frequently asked questions (FAQs).  

### Key Technical Concepts  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on their stake.  
- **Validators**: Nodes responsible for maintaining network integrity, validating transactions, and producing blocks.  
- **Stake Requirements**: Minimum token balance required to become a validator (e.g., AVAX).  
- **Validator Stats**: Metrics like stake amounts, uptime, and performance metrics (e.g., block production rate).  
- **Registration Process**: Steps to qualify as a validator (e.g., meeting staking requirements, verifying identity).  

### Implementation Details  
- **Stake Requirements**: Validators must hold at least 100,000 AVAX tokens (minimum) to participate.  
- **Validator Registration**: Requires submitting a proposal, verifying identity, and meeting network governance criteria.  
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Validators are selected via a randomization algorithm to ensure fairness and prevent collusion.  
- **Metrics Tracking**: Validator stats include block production rate, uptime, and transaction validation throughput.  

### Related Topics  
- **How to Become a Validator**: Detailed steps and requirements for registration.  
- **Validator Stats**: Comprehensive data on validator performance and network health.  
- **Validator FAQs**: Answers to common questions about validation processes and responsibilities.
