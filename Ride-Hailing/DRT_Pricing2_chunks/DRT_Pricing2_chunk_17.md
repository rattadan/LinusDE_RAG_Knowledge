## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 17

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

(2016),
it is taken into account that vacant vehicles cannot necessarily idle
everywhere. Therefore, pre-defined parking lots are considered for
vehicles to wait for their next request assignment. The real-world settings in which these ride-hailing problems occur
are most often typical taxi services. In Alonso-Mora et al. (2017)
and Wallar et al. (2018), sharing a trip with other customers is additionally possible. Car-sharing systems are examined in studies such
as De Souza et al. (2020), Fagnant and Kockelman (2014), and Spieser
et al. (2016), the first two of which use autonomous vehicles. Bischoff
and Maciejewski (2016) go one step further and investigate the possibility of replacing all private cars in Berlin with autonomous taxis. In Kullman et al. (2021), Al-Kanj et al. (2020), and Lu et al. (2012),
electric vehicles are used, extending the problem by adding charging
decisions.
