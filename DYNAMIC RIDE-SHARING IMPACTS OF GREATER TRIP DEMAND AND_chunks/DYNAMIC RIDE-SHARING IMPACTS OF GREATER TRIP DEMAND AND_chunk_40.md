## DYNAMIC RIDE-SHARING IMPACTS OF GREATER TRIP DEMAND AND - Chunk 40

**Document Summary:**

Thank you for sharing this reference list on shared autonomous vehicle fleet performance. This appears to be a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles and reports that discuss various aspects of shared autonomous vehicles, including their potential impacts on urban transportation systems, consumer preferences, and operational strategies.

The references cover a range of topics such as:

1. Congestion pricing with self-driving cars
2. Parking needs for shared fleets 
3. Consumer preferences for ride-sharing vs individual vehicle use
4. Optimization techniques to improve ridesplitting services
5. Effects on vehicle ownership and emissions
6. The "peak car" phenomenon and electric mobility services

The timeframe spans from 2014 to 2020, capturing recent developments in the field. Key authors include K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, T. Stoiber, et al.

If you need any specific information extracted or have questions about these references, please let me know! I'd be happy to provide more details on particular studies or analyze trends across the papers.

**Original Text:**

In order to maintain some comparison with simulation runs above,
and to be able to meet increased demand in this 1x density scenario, fleet size for the four
scenarios presented here were identical to the 5x trip-density runs above. Idling time across the
fleet remained similar to the base trip density scenario, but rose by about 4% when DRS was
turned on. There was more idling when comparing to the 5x density scenario that emulates
sparser pickup and dropoff locations from mimicking base density travelers, and this corresponds
to higher fleet utilization, meaning that a smaller fleet will be able to serve the City within
similar response times. Average person-trips per SAV per day was found much lower owing to
the same reason, but still at a high average daily person-trips per SAV compared to most other
studies looking at larger regions. With an SAV-focused demand, trip-density distribution is more
even in these scenarios, and was evident with the considerable drop in average SAV VMT
through the 24 hr day.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section of text provides technical details on a simulation study that aims to evaluate the impact of dedicated rapid transit (DRS) systems on urban transportation systems. Here's a focused analysis of what this chunk is explaining:

1. **Technical parameters and processes**: The exact technical parameters being referred to in this context are:
	* Trip-density scenario: 1x vs. 5x density
	* Simulation run conditions: identical fleet size, idling time, and response times for both scenarios
	* Key authors: K.M. Kockelman, J.W. Ward, M. Yan, et al.
2. **Connection to the surrounding context**: This chunk builds upon the previous text by providing additional context on the simulation study:
	* The comparison with simulation runs above implies that this study is based on hypothetical or representative models of urban transportation systems
	* The goal of maintaining a base trip-density scenario suggests that the researchers aimed to establish a baseline for comparison, allowing them to evaluate the impact of DRS systems
3. **Requirements and conditions**: This chunk mentions specific requirements and conditions for the simulation study:
	* The fleet size used in both scenarios was identical
	* Idling time across the fleets remained similar between the two scenarios

Overall, this technical detail provides a concrete understanding of the simulation study's methodology, parameters, and goals. It enables readers to understand how the researchers aimed to evaluate the impact of DRS systems on urban transportation systems.
