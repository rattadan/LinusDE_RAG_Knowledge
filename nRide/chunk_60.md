## Chunk 60

**Original Text:**

The value of NRIDE tokens is anchored to the convenience fee for cancellations, which reflects the inconvenience caused by a late cancellation or no-show. The escrow deposit adapts to the price of the token, targeting a deposit value of $10 (indicative). As a result, the price of the token is not capped by the market
value of a cancellation fee, and it can increase freely with demand. Token holders have the opportunity to invest in the growth of the nRide ecosystem and own a stake in its financial value. They can benefit from the networkâ€™s growth and adoption, as well as indirectly benefit from
rides booked on any nRide-compatible application.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

So, NRIDE tokens are valued based on their convenience fee for cancellations, which incentivizes token holders to book rides early or change their minds about traveling. The escrow deposit allows the company to hold funds in case a ride is cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances, but it doesn't limit the price of the token.

As a result, the token's value can fluctuate based on demand and market conditions, with potential for growth if the ecosystem grows and adoption increases. Token holders can benefit from their investment by potentially earning returns through the network's growth and rides booked on compatible applications.
