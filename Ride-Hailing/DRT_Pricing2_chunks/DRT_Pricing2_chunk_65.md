## DRT_Pricing2 - Chunk 65

**Document Summary:**

Here is a summary of the key points from the reference text related to ride-hailing systems and their operations:

- Various studies have explored how autonomous taxis could replace private cars in urban areas (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016; Al-Kanj et al. 2020).

- Dynamic trip-vehicle assignment is an important aspect of on-demand ride-sharing systems (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017). 

- Spatio-temporal demand forecasting and fleet management are critical for optimizing shared autonomous mobility fleets (Dandl et al. 2019; De Souza et al. 2020).

- Optimization-based strategies have been proposed for repositioning shared autonomous vehicle fleets to meet demand (De Souza et al. 2020). 

- Reinforcement learning techniques are being used for real-world vehicle repositioning in ride-hailing systems (Jiao et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2021).

- Empty-car routing and management is an important aspect of ridesharing operations (Braverman et al. 2019).

- Multi-taxi dispatch algorithms have been developed for mobile taxi-hailing systems (Gao et al. 2016). 

- Agent-based modeling has been used to study the travel and environmental impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (Fagnant, Kockelman 2014).

- Simulation studies have evaluated strategies for city-wide replacement with autonomous taxis (Bischoff, Maciejewski 2016).

- Various dynamic optimization models have been proposed to manage fleet operations in response to real-time demand signals (Ho et al. 2018; Hyland, Mahmassani 2018).

In summary, there is a substantial body of research focused on optimizing the operations of shared autonomous ride-hailing systems through advanced modeling and algorithmic approaches. The key areas include fleet management, vehicle repositioning, demand forecasting, and dynamic routing. Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to these problems.

**Original Text:**

The unselected vehicles
are then available for the profit calculation in the next iteration. Once all vehicles are repositioned or there are no more profitable
repositioning orders possible, the process is stopped and the
solution is executed. • Fleet size, in relation to the service area
• Demand-supply-ratio, as indication for over- and undersupply
• Maximum allowed customer waiting time before pickup or rejection
• Vehicle availability (all or only non-serving vehicles)
We consider three different fleet sizes, with 𝑉 ∈ {30, 100, 300}. The
number of requests depends on the fleet size. We define the demandsupply-ratio (𝐷𝑆𝑅) as the number of requests per day per vehicle. We
use 𝐷𝑆𝑅 ∈ {40, 70, 100}, representing fleets with low utilization, high
utilization, and overloaded fleets. For the maximum waiting time 𝑇𝑊 ,
we use three different settings: short waiting time, long waiting time,
and no waiting time.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

**Technical Details/Parameters**

1. `V ∈ {30, 100, 300}`: This specifies that there are three possible fleet sizes.
2. `DSR ∈ {40, 70, 100}`: These represent the demand-supply ratios for low, high, and overloaded fleets, respectively.

**Context Connection/Building**

This chunk builds upon the surrounding context by:

1. Providing a summary of key points from reference texts on ride-hailing systems.
2. Introducing new terms such as "unselected vehicles," "fleet size," "demand-supply-ratio (DSR)," and "maximum allowed customer waiting time."
3. Defining `VD` and `VT` variables, which are not defined in the provided text snippet.

**Requirements/Conditions**

1. The demand-supply ratio (`DSR`) should be between 40 and 100.
2. There will be three possible fleet sizes: V = {30, 100, 300}.
3. The maximum allowed customer waiting time should be:
	* Short waiting time (TW): less than or equal to `VT` (e.g., TW ≤ VT).
	* Long waiting time (LW): greater than or equal to `VT` (e.g., LW ≥ VT).
	* No waiting time: equal to `VT` (e.g., LW = 0).
