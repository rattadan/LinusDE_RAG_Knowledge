This summary encapsulates the key aspects of nRide, highlighting its mission, technology stack, development milestones, and long-term goals, providing a clear roadmap for future growth and impact.

**Original Text:**

NKN (New Kind of Network) provides multiple independent and self-organized relay nodes, enabling
clients to send and receive data for free without requiring a server or third-party services. This eliminates
the need for clients to have a public IP address or port forwarding. All data transmitted through the network
is end-to-end authenticated and encrypted, ensuring that only the sender and receiver can access and modify
the content. NKNâ€™s Proof of Relay (PoR) consensus mechanism incentivizes nodes to relay data packets and participate
in the network by providing computing resources, bandwidth, and storage, allowing it to achieve high levels
of scalability, security, and efficiency while remaining decentralized. 2.2. Messages
This section outlines the sequence of messages that are exchanged over the network to negotiate and agree
on a ride in the nRide protocol. It provides a detailed description of each message and its purpose in the
ride-hailing process.
