**Original Text:**

Addressing this limitation, we conducted an empirical investigation with a German ridepooling service, measuring stop times and
observing determinants for 226 stop activities through on-site observations during operational hours. Our analysis reveals that pick-ups
take significantly more time than drop-offs, with a 64% difference. We found a prevailing trend in DRT studies, where stop times were
consistently overestimated, and a lack of distinction between boarding and alighting. Our findings identified bulky luggage, the number
of passengers and passenger delays significantly increase stop times. A comparative analysis of distribution functions shows that a loglogistic distribution best captures the probability of ridepooling stop
times.
