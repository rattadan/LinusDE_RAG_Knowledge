**Original Text:**

It reveals that waiting time depends on
the origin but not on the destination, which fits intuition as one waits at the origin only. Requests departing from the center wait longer
(on average), which is caused by the higher competition for the vehicles. 20

A. Fielbaum et al. Average walking times (truncated to the first quintile) are shown in Fig. 10. They are concentrated towards the center of the
network (specially with respect to the origins). As vehicles are more shared in the center, when a user walks there it can benefit
(through reduced detours) more co-travellers than in the outer zones. This effect prevails over the longer detours that are expected in
the low-demand areas, because it is more difficult to find passengers whose routes are compatible. Finally, Fig. 11 shows heatmaps of the rejected requests, which is a better representation because they are just a few.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining how waiting time depends on both the origin and destination in ridesharing systems.

**Technical Details:** The text mentions "waiting time," "origin," "destination," and "detours." These terms are commonly used in the context of transportation studies, specifically urban mobility and traffic flow analysis. It also refers to the concept of "quintiles" (a set of five groups) to display average walking times.

**Context Connection:** This chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context by highlighting a specific aspect of ridesharing systems, namely the impact of origin and destination on waiting time. The text assumes some basic knowledge of transportation research and urban mobility, as it references specific studies (e.g., Fig. 10) from A. Fielbaum et al. This connection helps to establish credibility and authority in the field.

**Specific Requirements or Conditions:** None mentioned in this chunk.
