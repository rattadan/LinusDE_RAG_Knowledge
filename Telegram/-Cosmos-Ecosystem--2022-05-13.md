## üìù AI-Generated Summary
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a concise summary of the provided text focusing on key points and decisions. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account on May 13, 2022.

First, I need to go through each tweet and identify the main information. The first tweet mentions that $AKT is listed on HuobiGlobal and Crypto.com. That's a key point about a token listing. Then there's a Composite Money mention with $CMST backed by Cosmos assets, coming soon. Another tweet is about Cosmos Weekly News, asking for comments on IBC projects or events people are excited about. They use several hashtags like #IBCgang and list tokens. 

There's a tweet about supporting an IBC Memecoin, ChihuahuaChain, which seems like a community support announcement. Then a "Stay tuned #LUNAtics" which is vague but might indicate an upcoming announcement. The next one is just an emoji, so maybe not important. 

The last two tweets before the date jump are about Konstellation hosting a hackathon with a $26k prize pool. Then on the same date, there are two tweets about Terra Money: one questioning its future and another stating the network was stopped for the second time. 

I need to group these. The key points are:
1. AKT listings on two exchanges.
2. Composite Money's CMST coming soon.
3. Cosmos Weekly News and community engagement.
4. Support for a new memecoin.
5. Hackathon announcement with prize.
6. Terra Money's network issues and uncertainty.

Check for duplicates. There are two identical tweets about the hackathon, so that's one point. The Terra Money tweets are two separate ones but related. Should I mention both? The user wants key points and decisions, so maybe combine them as Terra facing network halts and future doubts.

Make sure to focus on the main announcements and decisions, not just the emojis or vague comments. Also, note the hashtags and mentions as part of the context. The summary should be in bullet points, clear and concise. Avoid including URLs unless necessary, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave them out. 

Wait, the user said "key points and decisions" so the hackathon prize, new listings, Composite Money's announcement, the memecoin support, the weekly news engagement, and the Terra Money issues. That's all

## üîç Topics & Themes
*AI-identified topics:*
> <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the main topics from this text as a comma-separated list. The text is a series of tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first tweet mentions that $AKT is listed on HuobiGlobal and Crypto.com. So the main topics here are AKT listings on those exchanges. 

Next, the second tweet talks about Composite Money ($CMST) backed by Cosmos assets and mentions ComdexOfficial ($CMDX). So topics here would be Composite Money and Comdex. 

Third tweet is about Cosmos Weekly News, asking for support with RT, and lists several IBC projects like ATOM, AXL, AKT, FET, UMEE, JUNO, EVMOS, LIKE, HUAHUA, STARS. The main topics here are Cosmos Weekly News and those projects. 

Then there's a tweet about ChihuahuaChain being the first IBC Memecoin. So that's another topic. 

Another tweet mentions LUNAtics and staying tuned, so LUNAtics is a topic. 

There's a tweet with just "üëÄ", which might not add a topic. 

Then two tweets about Konstellation hosting a Blockchain qDARC Hackathon with a prize pool. So Hackathon and Konstellation are topics. 

The last two tweets discuss Terra Money (LUNA), asking about its future and mentioning the network being stopped twice. So Terra Money and its network issues are topics. 

I need to compile all these into a list, making sure to include each main topic once. Duplicates like $AKT in different tweets should only appear once. Also, check if any topics are similar and combine them. For example, IBC gang projects mentioned in the third tweet would be covered by the listed tokens. 

So the final list would include: Cosmos Ecosystem, AKT listings, Composite Money, Comdex, Cosmos Weekly News, IBC projects (ATOM, AXL, AKT, FET, UMEE, JUNO, EVMOS, LIKE, HUAHUA, STARS), ChihuahuaChain, LUNAtics, Konstellation Hackathon, Terra Money network issues. 

Wait, but the user might want each individual token as separate topics? Or group them? The original instruction says "main topics", so maybe list each

## üòä Sentiment Analysis
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this sentiment analysis request. The user provided several tweets from the Cosmos Ecosystem account and wants to know the overall sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first one mentions that markets are red (which usually means negative in crypto because prices are dropping), but then it lists $AKT being on Huobi and Crypto.com, which are positive developments. The emojis like üëÄ might indicate caution, but the main point here is mixed: negative market but positive listings. However, the user might be focusing on the positive news despite the market, so maybe neutral or slightly positive.

Next, the second tweet talks about Composite Money backed by Cosmos assets coming soon. The emoji ü™ô and üëÄ suggest excitement and anticipation. This seems positive because it's announcing a new product, so positive sentiment here.

Third tweet is the Cosmos Weekly News, encouraging support with RT (retweet), using emojis like üî• and üó£Ô∏è. They're asking for comments on projects people are excited about. Definitely positive as it's promoting engagement and highlighting various tokens.

The fourth tweet is about supporting an IBC Memecoin, ChihuahuaChain, with "so cute" and üòå and üöÄ emojis. Positive and enthusiastic, so positive sentiment.

Then there's a tweet addressing LUNAtics with üåï, which is a playful reference. Stay tuned implies something upcoming, so neutral to positive, but maybe more neutral because it's just a teaser without details.

Another tweet with just üëÄ, which is neutral. It's a placeholder or a tease without clear sentiment.

Two tweets about a hackathon with a $26k prize. These are positive because they promote developer activity and opportunities. Definitely positive.

The last two tweets mention Terra Money stopping the network for the second time and questioning its future. These are negative. The network halting is a bad sign, and asking if they have a future shows doubt. So negative sentiment here.

Now, compiling all these: there are several positive tweets (weekly news, memecoin support, hackathon), some neutral (the single emoji, stay tuned), and a couple of negative ones about Terra. However, the user is asking about the sentiment of the entire text provided. Since these are multiple separate tweets, the overall sentiment would be a mix. But the question might be about each individual tweet. Wait, the

## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items
<think>
Okay, I need to extract any action items, decisions, or next steps from the provided text. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It mentions that $AKT is listed on HuobiGlobal and Crypto.com. The action item here might be for users to check those exchanges or consider trading $AKT there. But the tweet itself is just an announcement, so maybe the next step is to inform others about the listing or to use those platforms.

Second tweet: Talks about Composite Money's $CMST backed by Cosmos assets coming soon. The next step here is probably the launch of $CMST, but since it's announced as "coming soon," there's no immediate action except waiting. However, the mention of ComdexOfficial might imply they are involved in the rollout.

Third tweet: Cosmos Weekly News. They ask for support with RT (retweets) and want people to comment with #IBCgang projects they want to see. So action items here are to retweet the tweet and to leave comments with specific projects or events they're excited about.

Fourth tweet: Supporting the first IBC Memecoin, ChihuahuaChain. Action item could be to support or engage with that project, maybe by checking them out or participating in their community.

Fifth tweet: "Stay tuned #LUNAtics" with a rocket emoji. This is a prompt to stay updated, so next step is to wait for an upcoming announcement related to LUNAtics.

Sixth tweet: Just an eye emoji, which might be a teaser but doesn't have a clear action item.

Seventh and eighth tweets: Same content about Konstellation's Blockchain qDARC Hackathon with a prize pool. The action item here is for developers to participate in the hackathon. The tweet says "Devs do something!" which is a direct call to action for developers to take part.

Ninth tweet: Asks if Terra Money has a future, but it's a question posed to the audience, so maybe not an action item from the sender but encouraging discussion.

Tenth tweet: Mentions Terra Money stopping the network for the second time. This is informational, indicating a problem but not specifying an action item beyond awareness.

Putting this all together, the main action items are:

1. Retweet the Cosmos Weekly News tweet and comment with #IBCgang projects.
2. Developers should participate in the Konstellation Blockchain qDARC Hack
