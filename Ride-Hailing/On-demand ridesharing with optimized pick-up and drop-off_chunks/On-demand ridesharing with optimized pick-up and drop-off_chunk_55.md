**Original Text:**

Instead of an exhaustive computation over all the possible PUDO points, we consider a
limited set of ‚Äúcandidates‚Äù, found through a local search from the exact origins and destinations: in simple words, we consider as
candidates those neighbours of the exact origin (respectively, exact destination) that decrease the total costs, to then analyze their
neighbours; we continue doing so until no new neighbour is included as a candidate (i.e., total costs cannot be decreased with any
candidate‚Äôs neighbour). This is explained in detail in Algorithm 4, where X(u) stands for the walking-neighbors of u, X(u) =
‚Ä≤
‚Ä≤
‚Ä≤
{u ‚àà ùí± : uu ‚àà E ‚à® u u ‚àà E}. To understand this heuristic better, consider a given order in which to insert the request in the vehicle‚Äôs route, defined by (i, j). Without the heuristic, if the origin of the request is or , the set of pick-up candidates is {u ‚àà ùí± : tw (or ,u)‚©ΩŒ©a }.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section appears to be explaining a technical process or algorithm used in ridesharing systems. Here's a focused analysis:

**Exact Technical Details:** The algorithm, as described in the text chunk, is a local search-based heuristic for finding optimal routes that minimize total costs (represented by Œ©a). Specifically, it involves considering a limited set of "candidates" identified through a local search from the exact origins and destinations. These candidates are then evaluated based on their proximity to both the origin and destination.

**Connection to or Build-up upon surrounding context:** This chunk builds upon the key themes discussed in the surrounding reference list, which focuses on various aspects of ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems. The algorithm described is a critical component of this theme, addressing the challenge of optimizing routes while considering constraints such as proximity and distance.

**Specific requirements or conditions:** None are explicitly mentioned in this chunk, but it assumes access to an existing vehicle's route (represented by tw (or ,u)), which implies that the algorithm requires some form of spatial or geographic data to operate. Additionally, the algorithm is designed for ridesharing systems with multiple vehicles and destinations, suggesting that it may be used in scenarios where optimization is necessary across a large number of locations.

**Reinforcement Learning Approaches:** The text mentions reinforcement learning as one of several approaches discussed in the summary of key papers (e.g., Wen et al. "Reinforcement Learning Approaches"). However, this connection is not explicitly made in this chunk. It is worth noting that reinforcement learning can be used to optimize routes under various constraints, and may be considered an additional aspect of ridesharing system optimization.

In summary, this specific section explains a technical process (algorithm) for optimizing routes in ridesharing systems based on local search and proximity considerations, and builds upon the surrounding context by addressing challenges in ridesharing and mobility-on-demand systems.
