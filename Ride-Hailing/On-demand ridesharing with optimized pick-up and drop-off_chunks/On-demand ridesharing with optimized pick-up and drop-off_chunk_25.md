The set of previous requests currently being served by the system is denoted by
R0 . We aim to find an assignment that minimizes the resulting total costs, defined as the sum of users‚Äô costs cU for new passengers
(including the costs of being rejected), the extra users‚Äô costs ŒîcU for previous passengers induced by new detours, and the operators‚Äô
costs cO due to the new routes. Walking costs are included in cU . ‚àë

2.2. The solution method
We now explain how do we solve AP (Problem 1), together with the specific model we consider, i.e., which are the operational
constraints and how do we compute users‚Äô and operators‚Äô costs. We build upon the method proposed by Alonso-Mora et al. (2017) and
adapt it to include the possibility of walking. We now describe the main changes, which we explain in detail in the upcoming
subsections. The most relevant changes relate to the identification of feasible assignments between groups of users and vehicles.
