I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

[2] Note that the actual link provided in the original text was broken, so I removed it and just mentioned where the dataset/challenge can be found. Let me know if you need any other information or have questions about this topic!

**Original Text:**

Because this has an angle of
45‚ó¶ to the coordinate axes (similarly to the square zones themselves),
we propose to rotate the coordinate system by 45‚ó¶ to simplify the
calculations. Fig. 9 shows the rotated version. The area of the rectangle
can be calculated using the following formula:
(‚àö
) (‚àö
)
ùê¥rect =
2 ùëáùëä ‚àí ùõ•ùë• ‚ãÖ
2 ùëáùëä ‚àí ùõ•ùë¶

**LLM Contextual Output:**

I'll provide a focused analysis of the specific section explaining what this chunk is explaining.

**The exact technical details, parameters, or processes described in this chunk:**

This chunk describes a mathematical formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle that can be determined using coordinate geometry and spatial information. The formula involves the lengths of two sides (TW) and their difference (‚àõx^2 + y^2), which are calculated first. Then, the area is found by multiplying the result with the difference between these values.

**How this chunk connects to or builds upon the surrounding context:**

This chunk appears to be describing a mathematical approach or methodology used in urban transportation planning and management, specifically for predicting ride-hailing demand. The text mentions that the proposed method simplifies calculations and uses spatial information (coordinate geometry) to calculate the area of a rectangle. This suggests that the chunk is building upon a larger context of dynamic dispatch, real-time management, and simulation of autonomous taxi deployment in Berlin, as mentioned in the surrounding references.

**Any specific requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned:**

There are no explicit requirements, conditions, or constraints mentioned in this chunk. The text only provides technical details about a mathematical formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle.
