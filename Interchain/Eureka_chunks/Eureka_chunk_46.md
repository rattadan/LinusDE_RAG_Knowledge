## Eureka - Chunk 46

**Document Summary:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. Here's a summary of the key points and some additional insights:

### 1. **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Potential for timeouts or slippage.
     - Tokens are expected to be sent back to the source chain if these issues arise.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Similar rules apply as with IBC, but tokens may end up on the chain where the swap is supposed to take place.

### 2. **Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol)**
   - **Swap Failures:**
     - Slow relaying from Axelar can cause timeouts.
     - Slippage issues are also possible.
   - **Post-Swap Failures:**
     - Same as IBC post-swap failures.

### 3. **Circle Connect Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**
   - Relies on Circle's attestation service.
   - Circles' service outage can lead to funds being inaccessible.
   - Users will need to wait until the Circle attestation service recovers before their funds are available.

### 4. **Hyperlane**
   - Secured by Interchain Security Modules (ISMs).
     - **Multisig ISM:**
       - Requires a specific number of validators to sign attestations for successful processing.
       - Fails if the required signature threshold is not met, leading to funds being inaccessible on both chains until the threshold is achieved.

### 5. **Go Fast**
   - Timeout mechanisms ensure that users do not lose funds.
     - Intent expiration and refund process in case no solver fills the intent before a timeout.
     - Each transaction in a multi-tx sequence can fail independently, leading to tokens potentially ending up on different chains.

### Additional Insights:
- **Short-term Solutions:**
  - Adding packet tracking and live relayer/client status to the API to identify stuck packets early.
  
- **Medium-term Solutions:**
  - Implementing priority multi-hop relaying in the API to improve transaction success rates.

- **Long-term Solutions:**
  - Building better incentives for relayers, so they can operate profitably rather than as charities.

### Recommendations:
1. **User Education:** 
   - Inform users about potential failure points and what to expect if something goes wrong.
2. **Risk Management:**
   - Encourage users to monitor transactions and be prepared for potential delays or failures.
3. **Developer Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in cross-chain applications.

By understanding these failure points, developers and users can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-chain asset transfers.

**Original Text:**

Outcome / What to Expect: The users’ original source tokens are returned their starting address on the source chain
Common causes:
Inactive relayers on a channel allow a packet to timeout
Slippage (the amount out for the swap turns out to be less than the user’s specified minimum, i.e. their slippage exceeds their tolerance)
The user / frontend provides an invalid recovery address
An IBC client on the destination chain has expired
Examples: Consider a route where the source asset is ATOM on Neutron, the destination asset is STRIDE on Stride, and the swap takes place on Osmosis:
The user’s tokens transfer from Neutron to the Hub to Osmosis. The swap initiates but the price of STRIDE has gotten so high that the swap exceeds slippage tolerance and fails.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the technical details, parameters, or processes described in the given document context:

- **Outcome / What to Expect**: The users' original source tokens are returned to their starting address on the source chain.
- **Common causes**:
  - Inactive relayers on a channel cause packets to timeout.
  - Slippage (the amount out for the swap is less than the user's specified minimum, exceeding their tolerance) occurs when the intended destination asset has high prices.
  - Invalid recovery addresses are provided by the frontend user.
- **An IBC client on the destination chain has expired**.

This section connects to and builds upon the surrounding context by explaining the potential failure points in various cross-chain asset transfer protocols. It provides a detailed explanation of what might happen if these issues arise, including common causes such as inactive relayers, slippage, invalid recovery addresses, and the expiration of an IBC client on the destination chain.

Specifically, this section is discussing:

* Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) failures, which may result in timeouts or slippage.
* Axelar GMP (Generalized Messaging Protocol) failures, which may also cause timeouts or slippage.
* The potential for funds to be inaccessible on the destination chain due to a Circle attestation service outage.

This section is building upon the surrounding context by providing more detailed explanations of these failure points and their implications. It's helping users understand what might happen if something goes wrong with cross-chain asset transfers and how to mitigate those risks.
