# User Analysis: divine_economy

## Overview

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of tweets from someone talking about crypto, market trends, and some personal opinions. They want me to generate 5 keywords or tags that would help with postprocessing these tweets.

First, I need to identify the main themes in the tweets. The person talks about market trends, like the "timeline recap" where they mention if a token has a huge market cap, it's crime and you shouldn't buy. There's also a lot about the "2018 warren buffet quote" and how people are getting more cautious. They mention building in crypto now because no one else is, and the idea that the farcaster ecosystem needs more crimes. There's a lot about market makers, the importance of betting on the right tech, and the current state of the crypto market with everyone wanting to leave.

So the key themes here are: market trends, market makers, building in crypto, token valuations, and the current state of the market. But I need to make sure the keywords are distinct. Let me think.

The user also mentioned "top and bottom signals in crypto" and "everyone has stopped building completely." So maybe "market signals" or "market trends." Then there's the part about "the trick is to always trade against your beliefs," which relates to strategy. Also, the idea of "cashing out" in the guide, which is about exiting the market. 

Wait, the main tags could be: 
1. Market Trends
2. Market Signals
3. Token Valuations
4. Crypto Strategy
5. Market Exit

But maybe "Market Signals" is a bit broad. Let me check the original tweets again. The person talks a lot about market trends, how to read them, and the current state. So "Market Trends" and "Market Signals" are both relevant. Then "Token Valuations" because they mention market cap and whether to buy. "Crypto Strategy" because of the advice to trade against your beliefs. And "Market Exit" as in the guide about cashing out. 

Alternatively, maybe "Cashing Out" is a keyword. But the user wants 5 distinct ones. Let me see. The most distinctive patterns are: Market Trends, Market Signals, Token Valuations, Crypto Strategy, and Market Exit. That's five. They are all related to the analysis and strategy in the tweets. Yeah, that makes sense.

**Keywords/Tags for Postprocessing:**  
1. **Market Trends**  
2. **Token Valuations**  
3. **Crypto Strategy**  
4. **Market Signals**  
5. **Cashing Out**  

These tags capture the core themes of market analysis, token pricing, strategy advice, and exit strategies from the tweets.
