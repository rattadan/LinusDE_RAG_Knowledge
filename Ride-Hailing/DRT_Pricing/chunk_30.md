## Chunk 30

**Original Text:**

For the distance-related fare,
the DRT trip distance is calculated based on the beeline distance and an average beeline distance factor which
is obtained from the detailed DRT simulation. The average beeline distance is updated every k iterations and
considers the network layout and actual distance driven by DRT vehicles. Ihab Kaddoura et al. / Procedia Computer Science 170 (2020) 807–812

**LLM Contextual Output:**

It appears you're referencing a research paper titled "Procedia Computer Science 170 (2020) 807–812" by Ihab Kaddoura and colleagues, which deals with the calculation of distance-related fares in public transportation systems.

The paper discusses how the distance-related fare is calculated based on the beeline distance and an average beeline distance factor. The average beeline distance is updated every k iterations to consider changes in network layout and actual distances driven by DRT (Disruption Route Tracking) vehicles.

Can I help you with anything else related to this research or transportation systems in general?
