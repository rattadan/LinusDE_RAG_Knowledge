I've organized them by their primary focus areas, but there is significant overlap between these categories. The references cover a range of methodologies from simulation to deep learning approaches.

**Original Text:**

The first important feature considered
is whether customer requests have to be answered immediately or if the
response can be delayed. An immediate response contains the decision
for acceptance or rejection as well as the vehicle assigned to the
request. When the response can be delayed, multiple requests can first
be gathered before a decision has to be made. In some settings, the
maximum waiting time (Max WT) of customers is limited. If it is not
possible to pick up the customer within the time span of the maximum
waiting time, the request gets rejected. Furthermore, problem settings
differ in the vehicles considered to be available for assignment. While

The main contributions of this paper are threefold:
â€¢ We evaluate the design decisions of assignment approaches for
ride-hailing problems depending on various problem characteristics and derive which strategy should be used in which kinds of
settings to achieve the best results.

**LLM Contextual Output:**

This specific section is explaining the concept of dynamic dispatch, also known as real-time management or dynamic routing, within ride-hailing systems.

**Technical Details:**
- The system considers whether customer requests can be answered immediately (immediate response) or if a delay is acceptable (delayed response).
- A delay occurs when multiple requests are gathered before a decision has to be made.
- The maximum waiting time (Max WT) of customers determines the point at which a request is rejected if not picked up within that time frame.

**Contextual Connection and Requirements:**
- This section builds upon the surrounding context by establishing a framework for evaluating assignment approaches in ride-hailing problems, considering various problem characteristics such as vehicle availability, customer requests, and waiting times.
- The main contributions of this paper aim to determine which assignment approach should be used based on these factors.

**Specific Requirements or Conditions:**
- The section assumes the presence of ride-hailing systems with multiple vehicles and customers, indicating a real-world setting where dynamic dispatch is relevant.
