### Document Overview

### Key Technical Concepts

### Implementation Details  
- **Tokens**: FRAX and sFRAX are issued via the Noble platform, with USDN, USDC, USDY, EURe, and USYC as supported assets.  
- **Model Details**: FRAX’s algorithmic functions adjust collateral ratios dynamically to maintain USD peg, while sFRAX offers yield generation through staking.
