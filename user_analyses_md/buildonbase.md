Legitimacy-wise, the account appears legitimate. It's associated with the Base ecosystem, a known blockchain project by Coinbase. They share specific event details, technical upgrades, and partnerships, which are common in genuine project promotions. However, some RTs might be cross-checkable for authenticity.
